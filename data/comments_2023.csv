"17","Barbie",2023-05-30,"The fact that they made this movie the way we played Barbie as kids, making the Barbie‚Äôs life perfect, making ken follow Barbie everywhere, not using the stairs in a Barbie house."
"18","Barbie",2023-05-25,"I like how Barbie grow up with us: from kids&#39; cartoons to something kind of philosofic and thought-provoking. I&#39;m so glad her world is getting wider."
"19","Barbie",2023-05-26,"Margot is simply stunning. She brings so much heart to the role, she‚Äôs not just a blonde bimbo. She really was born to play Barbie."

"28","Barbie",2023-05-29,"Love how accurately they make her seem like a Barbie doll, from her staying stiff on her toes to floating to the ground since there&#39;s probably not a single kid in the world who used the stairs."
"29","Barbie",2023-05-25,"That ending bit where Ken wants to play doctor and ‚Äújust do one appendectomy‚Äù is genuinely hilarious"

"31","Barbie",2023-05-26,"Not only did Mattel approve a PG-13 Barbie movie mostly intended for adults who grew up with Barbies, but they also approved a story where they‚Äôre the villains. That‚Äôs just insane"

A breath of fresh air from all the remakes and reboots in Hollywood lately. Can&#39;t wait to see this!"

"42","Barbie",2023-05-25,"This feels like it‚Äôs gonna give kids their first existential crisis and I‚Äôm all for it"
"43","Barbie",2023-05-25,"I have a feeling that this movie will be a lot more deep and tear-evoking than just &quot;a Barbie doll goes on silly adventures.&quot; I&#39;m all for it."
"44","Barbie",2023-05-25,"That final line where the ideas lasts forever, is simply masterclass."
"45","Barbie",2023-05-25,"When Ryan Gosling appears at the back of the car and starts singing got me laughing out loud. Barbie looks so good, sounds like it has a witty script, a well-rounded plot that isn&#39;t just frills and great acting."
"46","Barbie",2023-06-26,"This movie is giving me late 90s, early 2000 vibes. It‚Äôs nice to see Hollywood making more weird, light-hearted, comedy films."
"47","Barbie",2023-06-01,"I&#39;m clearly not the target audience for this movie, but I&#39;m happy this movie exists. I am so tired of heartless remakes, reboots, reimaginings, sequels, prequels, etc, so it&#39;s refreshing to see people doing original things once again."
"48","Barbie",2023-06-01,"The way all barbie and Ken&#39;s lines sound like some absolutely feral play session with an 8 year old is what makes it for me"

"53","Barbie",2023-05-25,"I literally screamed at the 2 seconds of hearing I&#39;m a Barbie girl! I knew they&#39;re gonna have to put that song somewhere! I bet it‚Äôs gonna be in the credits"

"60","Barbie",2023-05-26,"i&#39;m super excited for this movie! one thing i don&#39;t see a lot of people talking about is how they absolutely NAILED the texture variation in the different types of plastic. it really sells the whole &#39;playset&#39; look of the houses and accessories. cars, slides, and roller skates are smooth and super shiny, while larger areas like the houses are made from a less shiny type."
"61","Barbie",2023-05-29,"This legitimately looks amazing. The shots look beautful, the sets are stunning, the cast is stacked, and the writing seems decent. Going to watch this in theatres"
"62","Barbie",2023-05-25,"Can&#39;t wait to see it, also love the fact they added Barbie girl at the end of the trailer just so people would shut up about it. Looks really good and it feels like a modern 2000s movie"
"63","Barbie",2023-05-26,"Kate‚Äôs character holding the Birkenstock really got me. üòÇ Like I had to pause it and I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing! This is going to be a phenomenal movie."
"64","Barbie",2023-05-29,"I LOVE the fact Make Your Own Kind of Music is in this trailer. Goes with the ‚Äòdoing your own thing‚Äô theme of Barbie"
"65","Barbie",2023-05-28,"Ryan Gosling seems to be killing it as Ken. I want to watch it just for his character honestly."
"66","Barbie",2023-05-26,"I&#39;ve grown up with bratz, barbie, and monster high. But Barbie was the one doll that had a HUGE part in my childhood. Seeing the trailer and all the hype for this movie makes me so excited, I can&#39;t wait to see Margot, Ryan, and America. Such a good casting! &lt;3"
"67","Barbie",2023-05-26,"&quot;If you love Barbie, this movie is for you, if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you&quot; is basically Greta Gerwig and her team saying that even if you don&#39;t like Barbie, you&#39;re still gonna have a great time watching this and i absolutely love that"
"68","Barbie",2023-06-03,"I love how excited Ken is about getting arrested both times. And his name being and Ken is iconic. And of course the Kate McKinnon Barbie is everything and I love all the Barbie aesthetics. Wonder if they‚Äôre going to get arrested because they steal clothes because they don‚Äôt know that they have to pay for them. Oh I am so exited."
"69","Barbie",2023-07-11,"As a 57 year old woman who never stopped loving Barbie, I say BRING. IT. ON!!"

"71","Barbie",2023-05-29,"I love how campy and clever this film looks. Seriously can‚Äôt wait"
"72","Barbie",2023-05-25,"How the freak did they make this actually look seriously good? I mean c&#39;mon, the whole thing is ridiculous and it works fantastically already. Also love how they have the balance between loving and hating Barbie, because I think that&#39;s where I am üòÇ"
"73","Barbie",2023-05-26,"Greta Gerwin has always been special, and her, having such a talented cast at her command, helps her case a lot"
"74","Barbie",2023-05-25,"This looks a lot like &quot;Enchanted&quot; but with Barbie and I love it. That&#39;s one of my favorite premises, two worlds, very different, blending together :D"
"75","Barbie",2023-05-25,"I found myself smiling through the whole trailer. I think my inner little girl is really excited. <br><br>Definitely gonna see it!"
"76","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"It&#39;s nice seeing how much Miles has grown. In the first movie, he needed his father&#39;s guidance, and in the second, it seems he needs his mother&#39;s. This movie is going to be so worth the wait."
"77","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"you can tell how much everyone loves miles! look at how all those other spidermen are trying to hug him!"
"78","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-19,"I love the transition from finding who you are to seeing if you can uphold your ideals in the real world and what it&#39;s like to deal with the pain and conflict of real life"
"79","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-04-03,"Miles&#39;s mom&#39;s message is one of the the greatest trailer lines around. Gets me every time"
"80","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-17,"30 seconds in, I was already getting goosebumps from the music, the dialogue, the flashbacks. This trailer lived well up to expectations, and beyond."
"81","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-01-29,"&quot;We are supposed to be the good guys.&quot;<br>&quot;We are.&quot;<br>I get chills everytime. I come back to this video just to hear that line reading again."
"82","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"The one thing I love about these movies is the art design! It‚Äôs honestly amazing. Paired with the story and characters I don‚Äôt see this movie being anything but great."
"83","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-15,"I know everyone is talking about the art style and how much Miles grew and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing but I gotta say the soundtrack is beautiful it really gives you the sense of what Miles is going through and how as a hero he should act ! Can‚Äôt wait for this masterpiece:)"
"84","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"That moment when you&#39;re more excited for a trailer than you&#39;ve been all year for anything else<br><br>Edit: to all the people who say that my life must be pretty depressing, I say you are completely and 100% correct"
"85","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I had the biggest smile on my face when I saw Peter B. Parker in the bath robe and the baby holder on his chest! Really makes the ‚ÄúDo I want kids?‚Äù line from the last movie come back in an amazing way."
"86","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"A trailer that gives a new idea, a general sense of the story and pulling some heart strings, WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE FREAKING STORY.   I thought they forgot how to make exciting trailers like this.  I&#39;m super hyped for the movie."
"87","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-18,"That slam at the end was personal as hell"
"88","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"MASSIVE appreciation for the VA of Mile‚Äôs mother here, I swear it‚Äôs like I can hear her holding back tears<br><br>EDIT: her name is Luna Lauren V√©lez for those who wanna know!"
"89","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I don&#39;t know what impressed me more: The beautiful animation or the fact that a trailer didn&#39;t spoil half of its movie"
"90","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"That last scene with him being chased by all the other spidermen was epic. This movie is going to blow our mindsüëç"
"91","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-02-22,"I remember watching this movie and seeing Miles talk to Stan Lee, asking if he could return the costume if it doesn‚Äôt fit, but as Stan himself said ‚Äúit always fits eventually‚Äù. That is what these heroes and especially spider-man are suppose to represent that anyone can be a hero regardless of who you are or we‚Äôre you came from. If you are standing up for what you know is right not just for yourself but for others, that is what makes someone a true hero. Thank you Stan Lee for the decades of stories and the characters that show who we can become and who we desire to be someday."
"92","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"At the end of the first film I wondered if Peter B. would end up having kids with MJ as the film implied, and seeing him with a baby carrier just made my little continuity-loving heart sing. I&#39;m so excited for this movie! I&#39;m glad nothing major was spoiled in this trailer"
"93","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Might just be the most emotionally mature and emotionally relatable trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. Just one mother&#39;s love for her son. Everyone with a good mother has had a conversation like this."
"94","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You‚Äôre not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire movie, but it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe. That‚Äôs a trailer!!!"
"95","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-18,"Watching the first spider verse movie in the cinemas when I was 13 is the movie that made me realise that I wanted to be an animator- I‚Äôm 17 now and WELL on my way to becoming one :) this movie was such an inspiration for me and it still is 4 years later"
"96","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I really love that 2099 Spidey is in this. He&#39;s easily one of my favorite versions of Spider-Man."
"97","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-04-12,"&quot;wherever you go you have to take care of that little boy for me. make sure he never forgets where came from and never doubts he is loved&quot;<br><br><br>i always get chills on this one, i can really feel it"
"98","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"The quality of the visuals are 10/10. Love how they seamlessly blend the different animation styles together. Another banger movie as expected from Lord &amp; Miller"
"99","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I was not expecting to get emotional when I first saw the title of this trailer, but speaking as a father to a young son, Miles&#39;s mother captured the entire essence and struggle of a parent&#39;s journey in one piece of dialogue. Amazing."
"100","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"A sequel to an amazing animated film. Still to this day the music, colors and imagination the first one had is top tier. The influence it has on other series is awesome and I can only hope miles gets more love in this movie."
"101","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-15,"Pouring one out for all the animators being sacrificed to bring this into existence."
"102","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-02-25,"Damn seeing Peter as a father is emotional. Looks like he&#39;s come so far from the first film and I can&#39;t wait to see him again"
"103","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"The first Spider-Verse movie opened up so many gateways for Marvel and Sony that resulted in NWH being made! Can&#39;t even imagine what this one&#39;s gonna bring!"
"104","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"It‚Äôs so cool seeing so many different kinds of spidermen, especially when they actually make them relatable and realistic to what teens would do. What a great time to be alive to be able to see it come to life on the big screen."
"105","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"Many people were surprised by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse when it came out. They didn&#39;t expect it to be as successful as it was, and it gave us a new perspective on the world of superheroes. It also brought back our sense of wonder about the possibilities of animation. It introduced us to the new hero, Miles Morales, and showed us how he is just as compelling as Peter Parker. I am so excited to see more epic things coming to the upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse."
"106","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Spider-Man is a character you can‚Äôt help but root for! He has this amazing emotional connection with his fans that no other superhero has. <br>I still cry happy tears in NWH when MJ is saved by Peter 3 and I watched that film several times!"
"107","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"I can&#39;t wait to see this movie next year. When I saw the first Spider Verse it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time. The animation, the visuals, the writing, dialogue, and musical score were all phenomenal. If the first one was good then the sequel could be just as good. üíñüíñüíñ"
"108","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"This movie was the most visually stunning cinema of the last 5 years. Maybe even longer. The fact that is had loveable characters, well written dialogue, and a superhero story that didn&#39;t feel like a rehash of the same tired tropes? That was all just gravy.<br><br>If this sequel manages to bring it visually again, and still work in even a fraction of the same charm, it&#39;ll be a huge success."
"109","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"Looks intense. Love seeing how badass Spidey 2099 is, popping the claws out and everything."
"110","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"seriously, more movie trailers today needs to have a story behind it like this one, not just action scenes and dramatic music, but actually paying tribute to the message of the movie"
"111","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"I love how Miles‚Äô mother is kind of describing what‚Äôs gonna happen or what the story will be."
"112","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-04-04,"UGH this made my cry. The way she speaks to Miles is warm. Im a mother now and my only wish is that my child grows up knowing he is loved. Im breaking the mexican misogyny and opening doors to talk about mental illness without having to sugarcoat anything. It‚Äôs something i want my baby to know. Thats feeling emotional doesnt make u we it makes you human and thats okay ‚ù§"
"113","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"This is my most anticipated movie. I can&#39;t wait to see Miles grow even more in this film üíô"
"114","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Now that&#39;s a good trailer. Getting us emotionally invested instead of just spoiling the coolest scenes and plot of the movie"
"115","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2023-01-09,"I swear this is the only trailer I&#39;ve come back to multiple times almost daily. Idk there&#39;s just something so addicting about it. The heart, animation, music, action, message. I love it."
"116","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-15,"Loved the shot where Miles and Gwen first see all the different Spider people. Then the sudden shock at the end when they are all attacking Miles. Im extremely hyped for the movie."
"117","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-16,"I loved into the spider- verse. Not only it&#39;s ny favorite spider- man movie ,and one of my favorite animated features films, but it&#39;s literally one of my favorite movies of all times. It&#39;s a love letter to Spiderman, and pushed the boundaries of what animation as a medium is truly capable of.<br>I cant wait to see what across the spider- verse ,and beyond the spider verse will bring us to the table üï∑üï∏"
"118","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-20,"I watched Into the Spiderverse with my dad just before my last year of high-school after a long series of personal struggles. This one comes just before I finish my Bachelor&#39;s degree and just before I move on to my last 3 to get my masters, all the while I&#39;ve had a lot of personal struggles. They keep dropping when I&#39;ve needed em, when I least expected. So excited for this one!"
"119","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I love that these trailers don&#39;t give away the plot. I&#39;m curious as to what happens and that&#39;s how trailers should make the audience feel."
"120","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"What more could a huge Spider-Man fan want than to see so many Spider-Men in one shot? üï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüî•üî•"
"121","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"To everyone who spent all days and years working on this movie I want to thank you for putting everything into this and I hope your families are proud of you. You&#39;re all the real heros"

And i haven‚Äôt felt alone and out of place like this in so long. That speech reminded me of my folks. Jeez, I‚Äôm a wreck right now. <br><br>Haha, will prob cry again when i watch this in theaters. This trailer is incredible, and its got me tied in emotionally already."

"124","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I can&#39;t wait to see this movie next year. When I saw the first Spider Verse it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time. The animation , the visuals, the writing , dialogue,  and musical score were all phenomenal. If the first one was good then the sequel could be just as good."
"125","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of animation and its techniques / processes, so much that I actually started tearing up a little watching this trailer as silly as it is. It‚Äôs just really nice to see something that obviously has a lot of passion, creativity, and love put towards it to pay tribute to not just animation as a creative medium, but also to Spider-Man ."

"129","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-16,"Teared up through it all. That speech his mother give about not forgeting and remembering and acceptance of who you are is so beautiful. Resonates so much with the period I&#39;m going through my life."
"130","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Into the Spiderverse inspired the animation industry to experiment more instead of chasing tehnically advanced graphical fidelity like Pixar and Disney, on top of being the best Spidey animated film ever. I&#39;m so excited to see what Across the Spiderverse brings to not just fans of Spider-Man, but also fans of animation ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you to everyone working to make these films great!<br><br>Edit: Changed &quot;realism&quot; to &quot;graphical fidelity&quot; to be more accurate, sorry about the confusion! üòÖ"
"131","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"The best superhero movies are the ones that remind us that these superheroes we see on T-shirts and backpacks are people that feel like we do.  They&#39;re not just action figures.  <br>They&#39;re characters in a story.  They&#39;re made to make you feel something."
"132","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Gotta love how Gwen keeps her the hairstyle Miles accidentally caused from the first movie, (even though she&#39;s had time to grow it out again if she wanted to) as a memory of him"
"133","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"They&#39;re  so many easter eggs to unpack, thank you to everyone who worked to everyone who worked on these films and brought our childhood to life. This is how you make multiverse content."
"134","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"This is the perfect movie trailer. It doesn&#39;t spoil anything that big and most of all it makes you question the plot which then makes you infinitely hyped up for this film. Can&#39;t wait."
"135","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Hard to believe that it&#39;s been almost 4 years since Into the Spider-Verse came out, now with the new trailer for Across The Spider-Verse released already, it&#39;s already exciting to see it all come together all at once! DEFINITELY excited for this one to come out next year for sure!"

"149","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"This movie will probably deserve to be one of the top films of 2023 for the art direction alone, but the last movie wasn‚Äôt just beautiful art, it had a great story and plot.  Probably the movie I‚Äôm the most excited for."
"150","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"Let&#39;s be honest the amount of hardwork cast and crew has applied in this masterpiece is just beyond the limits üòç"
"151","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-13,"I like how this style of animation gives ways to Spider-Man&#39;s of varying shapes and builds. I&#39;m used to seeing them all with standard physiques, it&#39;s kind of refreshing to see them with more bulky appearances as well."
"152","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse",2022-12-14,"After being disappointed with many movies this year this one excites me"

"155","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-02,"I got chills when Rocket called Quill, &quot;Pete.&quot; When has he ever called him by his first name? That really stressed the importance of that moment. Almost a sense of finality."
"156","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-01,"From being the Marvel&#39;s unknown team for non comic book readers to being one of the most memorable and solid MCU family in Pop culture"

"158","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-01,"It&#39;s amazing how this group went from having a C list characters that not too many people heard in the comics to a huge A list characters in the movies aswell as became part of pop culture in various media. Goes to show how absolutely genius James Gunn is in taking care of these characters"
"159","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-02,"&quot;Pete, I&#39;m done running.&quot;<br>I can already feel my heart breaking for Rocket. It almost seems like, to me at least, that this may be his ending."
"160","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-02,"I love how they wear the colors of Yondu to honor him.. Which also matches to their comic accurate suits."
"161","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2023-01-15,"The fact that the Guardians started as some underdogs that most people have never heard of, and now they are one of the most iconic superhero teams of the MCU and of all time, really sells out how their journey has come so far, while I&#39;m sad their story will end, I&#39;m glad that it happened"
"162","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-02,"Two things: 1) Glad Gamora is finally making a reappearance, and 2) that ‚ÄúWe are Groot‚Äù at the end honestly made me tear up a little üò¢"

"165","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2023-05-03,"Just finished watching the film. I cried, I laughed but most of all I clapped right at the end. A true roller coaster of a movie and it got the ending it deserved. Definitely the best MCU film since Endgame."
"166","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2023-01-17,"My fianc√© passed away March 14, 2022 in a car accident, and Guardians is one of our favorites to watch, and wanted the soundtracks to play at our wedding. Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out, as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together. I like to think it&#39;s him saying &quot;hey, I&#39;m still here.&quot; I cannot wait to see this and feel all of the emotions."

I love how are the most comedy-filled ones, but still managed to get the most emotional scenes at the end. I&#39;m not ready to say goodbye to the Guardians, specially the saddest being in the Galaxy (yes, Rocket), but I know it will be and amazing, emotionally driven send off"
"170","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-02,"The music, the dialogs, and the foreshadowing. Man we are going for one hell of an emotional ride."

"177","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2023-01-23,"It amazes me how this feels so much more like an epic conclusion to these characters than anything else in the MCU ever has."
"178","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-11,"For me the appeal of the Guardians is that it celebrates the &quot;Found&quot; family. Finding people you connect with on a level that transcends blood is an amazing thing. Sometimes those people are a fading twinkle that flickers out too soon. Some stay with you for life. I&#39;ll be sad when this groups story is over but it was amazing while it lasted."
"179","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-08,"It&#39;s honestly so cathartic seeing Nebula looking so happy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3V5KDHRQvk&amp;t=79"">1:19</a>. Her character&#39;s gone through so much and changed so much through the series.

"183","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-04,"For those of you that dont realize why not all marvel movies look this good its because James Gunn is a true talented director. He will be missed as hes now heading over to DC to help them create their universe. Its gonna be tough saying goodbye to the guardians."
"184","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3",2022-12-08,"it‚Äôs gonna be so hard to say goodbye to the guardians, they‚Äôre easily (and have always been) my favourite group in the MCU and I think ever in any movie/show. I‚Äôll miss them ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è"

The ‚Äúmotley crew‚Äù that becomes a family has seldom ever been portrayed in movies as well as it has here. Seriously, my favorite movies of the MCU and in general.

"225","Oppenheimer",2023-04-10,"I think it‚Äôs very nice of Christopher Nolan to create a movie that will finally give Cillian the Oscar he‚Äôs always deserved‚Ä¶"
"226","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Man, cillian murphy came a long way in his career, absolutely deserved. He&#39;s an amazing actor and I loved him since 28 Days Later."

Never had this many likes before. Thanks guys, and just over ONE MONTH LEFT!!<br><br>Opening day edit: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"228","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Cillian has usually always been more of a side character to some of Nolan‚Äôs movies and now he‚Äôs finally the main character and it‚Äôs very well deserved for a actor like him. He‚Äôs going to kill it without a doubt"
"229","Oppenheimer",2022-12-24,"Not a Marvel, Superhero, Avatar sequel movie and the fact that this already has 30.8 mill views in less than a week. WOW, Christopher Nolan really is the brand itself"
"230","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"Cillian is one of the greats of this generation. He looks utterly transformed, physically but also the mannerisms are so on-point. Even just the eyes...This is gonna be spectacular."
"231","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I love the fact he can make a film about Oppenheimer and he‚Äôs guaranteed a massive audience just because he‚Äôs Christopher Nolan . Legendary director"

"235","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"The fact that at one point in the film Murphy will say &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&quot; already gives me chills"

"239","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Once i hear Cillian deliver the &quot;I am become Death&quot; speech, i will be complete as a human being. What a brilliant actor"
"240","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Couple of things:<br><br>1. Murphy&#39;s eyes are almost like a character in themselves. They express so much, and Nolan made sure to emphasize them to convey magnitude.<br><br>2. I&#39;m curious to see if the close ups of the atomic reaction will also act as a developing character as well, showing more and more of the reaction coming to fruition as the story develops, similar to the blood stain in Insomnia."
"241","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt fear it until they understand it‚Ä¶and they won‚Äôt understand it until they‚Äôve used it‚Äù  i‚Äôm ready for everything about this movie the dialogue, to the film scores to the cinematography."
"242","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy captured J. Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s thousands mile stare so perfectly. You can see it in his eyes, the &quot;I&#39;ve done the worst thing anyone can imagine, and I regret it!&quot;-look.<br><br>This could turn out to be a must see for me, the entire premise is so chilling to the core. And especially when we know what those tests resulted in and how much it seemed to haunt Oppenheimer to his death."
"243","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Give the cast and crew a big round of an applause for sacrificing themselves from a large nuclear bomb explosion during filming make the movie felt more real and authentic"
"244","Oppenheimer",2022-12-23,"i hope Mr. Nolan can finally win his most deserving oscar by this film,already a masterpiece."
"245","Oppenheimer",2023-07-16,"I&#39;ll never forget the time I visited with a WW2 veteran, who was one of the test subject soldiers exposed to an atomic blast.  With &quot;eyes wide shut&quot; and hand in front of his face, he could see the bones in his hands, through his closed lids, through the goggles he wore.  Absolutely awe inspiring, but absolutely frightening.   I would have crapped myself."
"246","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"Cillian Murphy is an absolutely impeccable choice for this role - not often I get excited for new movies nowadays but this could be really incredible."
"247","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"Artists like Murphy and Nolan are beyond any award. Their Craft is a glory for audience. Loved it."
"248","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"The casting of cillian here is genius, he&#39;ll finally play a lead role in a Nolan film tooüî•"
"249","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy has killed it in so many smaller roles in Nolan&#39;s films- it&#39;s about time he headlines one.  Even from the footage in this trailer alone he looks to be giving a great, soulful performance.  His scene in Inception at his father&#39;s deathbed was so simple but powerful."
"250","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Man, I&#39;d almost forgotten what a talented actor Cilian Murphy actually is! Seeing him in a role other than Tommy Shelby is an amazing change of pace!"
"251","Oppenheimer",2022-12-31,"‚ÄúNow I am become death, destroyer of worlds‚Äù.<br><br>-Oppenheimer"
"252","Oppenheimer",2023-07-20,"Christopher Nolan Infinity Stones :<br>Space - Interstellar<br>Mind - Memento<br>Reality - Inception<br>Power - Batman<br>Time - Tenet<br>Soul - Prestige <br><br>Oppenheimer is the Gauntlet"
"253","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"The fact that they worked on the tiny detail of the atomic plasma ball disintegrating the tower wire already tells me that this movie is going to be amazing. Christopher Nolan always delivers a very thorough film."
"254","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"The man who is responsible for what is arguably the most impactful creation in the history of humanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. And who‚Äôs face is filled with nothing but fear and regret for having made it. This looks incredible."
"255","Oppenheimer",2023-01-14,"My god...Cillian&#39;s voice is stunning. It sounds frighteningly like Oppenheimer&#39;s. How does he do that? He bends his voice so well to any role. He&#39;s so underappreciated as an actor and I hope he shines bright in this movie.<br><br>Edit: And the Oscar goes to..."
"256","Oppenheimer",2023-04-22,"&quot;I thought we were building a rice cooker&quot;<br>Incredible. Such powerful words!"
"257","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Every time Nolan releases a film, it&#39;s seriously its own cinematic event. I&#39;m sad TENET didn&#39;t score big, but it was still one hell of an experience in IMAX, and this looks even more outstanding."
"258","Oppenheimer",2023-01-05,"Why does Cillian seems to fit perfectly in every role he plays"
"259","Oppenheimer",2023-07-20,"If Murphy doesnt get an Oscar for this then the Oscars will simply never be respected ever again. This is cinematic genius. This is the benchmark for brilliance"
"260","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"This looks fantastic. Cillian seems perfect for this role. An amazing actor with integrity. Really hope this gets him the respect he deserves and leads to greater opportunities.<br>On a side note, I&#39;m very surprised he is not been touted as the next Bond"
"261","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"Nolan never misses with the music and absolute perfect casting in his movies."
"262","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"This movie is going to be another cinematic masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Also, I‚Äôm glad that Cillian Murphy is having the chance to prove his unique performance to portray the man who built the most powerful and destructive weapon ever created."
"263","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Christopher Nolan always does the big screen justice. He makes some amazing films."
"264","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I was surprised at how Cillian&#39;s voice sounds remarkably like Oppenheimer, then actually seeing him and he looks like Oppenheimer as well!  I am very excited to see this movie.  Great actors and an amazing director coming together to tell such a compelling story.  The human piece behind making the most destructive force our planet has ever seen..."
"265","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Just the facial expression of his shows the immense emotions and the heart he had put in. I won&#39;t be surprised if he is front runner for Best Actor nomination next time around."
"266","Oppenheimer",2023-02-02,"What I really love the most about this trailer is the music. It‚Äôs atmospheric, strangely uplifting as well as sinister, very emotive. The swelling horns or strings or whatever they are extremely warm and uplifting, which contrasts so strangely but beautifully against the horror of the potential of nuclear weaponry. The imagery is cosmic, big-bang-esque, yet all the dialogue points to the anxiety and dread of such an invention. I love this contrast very much, it creates a strange space we‚Äôre we can sort of feel how absurd, miraculous, and horrifying it is for human beings to have reached the threshold of such power. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we can be trusted‚Ä¶‚Äù well that‚Äôs really the thesis of the whole thing aint it"
"267","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I am floored by how crisp and beautiful this footage looks.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=24"">0:24</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=27"">0:27</a> are splendid.  Oddly enough, with Nolan going back to black and white (being the first production to shoot black and white IMAX footage, at that), this seems to be his most colourful and vibrant film yet.  Pause the video and scroll to random times throughout the trailer.  Each frame highlights the variety of colours ‚Äì many feel like they could be a promotional still.  In short: I am excited."
"268","Oppenheimer",2023-02-19,"He can out act 99% of Hollywood just with his face. After seeing that 1 scene in Inception (safe scene with his dad), thats when I knew this dude is truly a phenomenal actor."
"269","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"A huge respect to Nolan&#39;s dedication to shooting without CGI.<br>Looks absolutely brilliant and beautiful&#39;"
"270","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Hopefully this can get Cillian a much deserved Oscar nom!"
"271","Oppenheimer",2023-03-21,"I don&#39;t expect less than an Academy Award¬Æ nomination for Cillian Murphy as Best Actor and a nomination for Robert Downey Jr. as Best Supporting Actor. This movie is gonna be insane! Christopher Nolan never disappoints."
"272","Oppenheimer",2022-12-21,"Murphy really brings home the terror that Oppenheimer felt about their creation. This trailer looks stunning. So excited to watch this next year in theatre!"
"273","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I haven‚Äôt seen another actor that conveys so much emotion through his face‚Ä¶. You can tell complex emotions just through his eyes alone. Amazing"
"274","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I swear, the cinematography in Christopher Nolan‚Äôs movies makes them look like pure art"
"275","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"You can never go wrong with Christopher Nolan, he‚Äôs one of the great directors out there"
"276","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"What a great person to play Oppenheimer. Murphy has such a talent for emoting internal conflict and introspection on the faces of his characters. Oppenheimer‚Äôs direct contribution to the development of nuclear technology is as much a revolutionary innovation in science as it is a threat to peace, and Oppenheimer was keenly aware of that fact. Oppenheimer is a figure that perhaps best exemplifies the tension between human progress and the moral implications of such weaponry. Oppenheimer didn‚Äôt regret being integral to the development of such technology, but any sane man would look at his creation and feel the mitest sort of dread of the possible uses of such a thing, and how that would change the course of history."
"277","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"i love that the score alternates between hopeful and ominous notes. this is likely one of the themes in this movie"
"278","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I applaud Christopher Nolan&#39;s commitment to getting his shots in-camera, using film, with practical effects done on the set whenever possible. So for this one I have concerns..."
"279","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"It‚Äôs not often when movie trailers can give you chills.  The music with the beautiful scenery &amp; horrific destruction is top tier film making.  This is definitely my most anticipated film now."
"280","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I love how in each still shown in this trailer, Cillian Murphy has the expression of the man who is terrified of his creation but still goes on pursuing it without any control over his mind or heart! Absolutely genius actor and an equally brilliant director. Can&#39;t wait to watch this masterpiece ‚ù§"
"281","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"The absolute range of Murphy&#39;s acting is that he can go from a terrifying warlord gangster to a man questioning his entire existence, this is gonna be a legendary film."
"282","Oppenheimer",2023-04-21,"&quot;I thought we were building a rice cooker&quot;"
"283","Oppenheimer",2023-06-14,"This trailer gives me goosebumps. Murphy&#39;s face, the soundtrack, the quotes such as &quot;they won&#39;t understand it until they&#39;ve used it&quot; are just trilling and sublime. Will look forward to this."
"284","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"I need Nolan to win an Oscar. He deserves it"
"285","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"This feels like a trailer for an amazing historical sci-fi  story where a man blinded by curiosity and ambition stumbles upon a horror that should never have been discovered...<br><br>And then you realize this is a true story"
"286","Oppenheimer",2023-05-05,"Just give Cillian an oscar already. He&#39;s incredible. Aaand finally he&#39;s done it!!!üôå"
"287","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"J Robert Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures in the era of World War II. He has been long overdue for a biopic movie, I&#39;m so glad that the movie got the right writer and director to make a movie based on his life and his career"
"288","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"This is just masterpiece. Emotions on Cilian&#39;s face are just amazing. What a versatile actor. And Nolan.. no words for him"
"289","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I am really anticipating this movie. Nolan&#39;s work and dynamicism, minimizing the use of CGI -and G√∂ransson‚Äôs flawless orchestral soundtrack integration ability - and Murphy&#39;s ability to immerse himself utterly into a role - this movie is a guaranteed masterpiece."
"290","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"This feel as epic as Interstellar.   Nolan is bet when he does not make a movie, but instead engages and invites his audience to participate in the cinema.    I had zero expectations for this film... until I watched this trailer.     I am confident, and excited to experience, Nolan demonstrating the impact this historical event delivered unto our society."
"291","Oppenheimer",2022-12-23,"Beautiful trailer. It&#39;s great to finally see him leading the cast of a Nolan picture. I&#39;ve been waiting for this one."
"292","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre FINALLY telling this man‚Äôs story. We‚Äôve all heard his name in other films or WW2 lessons, but I really doubt anyone understands what he was. This should be amazing."
"293","Oppenheimer",2022-12-25,"Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is the most perfect casting as we can see after the invention Oppenheimer became very lifeless. Cillian can portray that expression EXTREMELY WELL."
"294","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> that stare itself deserves to get an oscar of its own, that stare shows the realisation that he got by seeing his own invention as how destructive it is for humans and the terror he got by thinking that and Cillian depicted that perfectly.. <br>Hats off to such gem of an actor.."
"295","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Definitely gonna be something I&#39;ll be looking forward to for the next year. <br>The combination of Cillian Murphy&#39;s acting with Nolan&#39;s direction. <br>A &quot;boom&quot; duo!!"
"296","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"You can never go wrong with Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy"
"297","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"I‚Äôm excited for Cillian to get the recognition he deserves! He is such an amazing and underrated actor!"
"298","Oppenheimer",2022-12-20,"Cillian Murphy has grown into a fine and mature actor. Over the years, his acting skills enhanced exponentially and his career has attained a new height. This shows that there&#39;s always room for learning, improving and growing."
"299","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy is going to nail his performance. A fantabulous spectacle this is going to be. The optical aspects of this film are gonna be skyrocketing. The incredible direction. Then the biopic. Christopher Nolan is at ready for an Oscar."
"300","Oppenheimer",2023-01-05,"My favorite part of the trailer is when the music suddenly shift key from a triumphant major (?) To a minor. A perfect encapsulation of the sense of &quot;Oh yeah we did it!&quot; To &quot;What have we done?&quot;"
"301","Oppenheimer",2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy finally getting leading role that he deserves."

"373","Avatar: The Way of Water",2022-11-07,"I saw the first Avatar when I was 9, and never expected another movie until the news came out that there will be another Avatar. The nostalgia really hits. The music, the scenery, Jake Sully, Neytiri, everything. Had to watch the first movie again. Bringing back the glory days of 2009."

It was the kind of beautiful that made me emotional, perhaps it was my inner child, but the need of fantasy, the need for an escape from the mundane was fully satisfied, after more than a decade of waiting, finally experiencing something you‚Äôve been wanting to since you were 12, now 24- of course it had me tearing up even at happy scenes !! Never watched a movie in theaters twice before, but this will be the exception<br>UPDATE: still cried the second time :‚Äô) I watched it on IMAX this time, personally, I preferred Dobly- the seats are more comfortable, the colors were richer, the sounds were louder, overall felt more engaged"
"379","Avatar: The Way of Water",2022-11-02,"We need more trailers like this. It doesn&#39;t give everything away about its plot, it doesn&#39;t try to be action-y or flashy, it just lets you be fascinated."

Some of us who worked on the movies do take the time to read through the comments on the trailers, and seeing the overwhelmingly positive response from you all so far has made the YEARS of work that have gone into these films worth it for all of us.

"384","Avatar: The Way of Water",2022-11-02,"I work for one of the studios that put a lot of heavy work on this film. Lots of crazy overtime, on average some will work 56-70hours. Very tight weekly deadlines, the stress levels were high, and the technical challenges for the motion editors, animators and VFX people in general were many. But seeing it all come together into this incredible master piece makes it all worth it. We hope everyone enjoys it. I cannot wait to see this movie!<br><br>EDIT: Besides the intense amount of work, there was also ALOT of fun stuff in the production of this film. Working in the film/Vfx can be fun and gives you new challenges and different ways to upskill and keep getting better. <br><br>And for those who are asking about the story....Let me just say, the movie is 3hours long, it&#39;s going to move you, it&#39;s going to touch you and it&#39;s going to blow your mind ;)"
"385","Avatar: The Way of Water",2022-11-02,"I remember seeing Avatar at the opening midnight showing in IMAX 3D. The entire theater had been decorated with trees and vines and plants to look like Pandora. The IMAX had been calibrated specifically for the film. Sold out theater. Then some reps from the IMAX and film industry asked us to stay after to discuss the film, and then asked everyone if they were ready to see the most expensive motion picture ever made, the audience went crazy. It was like being at a sports event. Then they did a countdown from 10. Such an unforgettable movie going experience."

He went to a local Blockbuster CD store that was there at the time, and bought James Cameron&#39;s Avatar. I was so confused but at the same time, I was having the time of my life watching the whole thing. Avatar has been my favorite movie for years and I&#39;ve been waiting for the sequels ever since. I&#39;m so happy its almost here! Also, I love hearing Sigourney Weaver&#39;s voice again!"

I would watch the movie over and over again, I knew every line, every character by name. I trotted my Leonoptrix through elementary like I was the coolest kid. When I tell you this came up a few months back, actual new visuals, new storyline, new characters, I jumped screamed and started crying. I am so very excited, plus James Cameron sequels are always known to be the best."

"406","Avatar: The Way of Water",2022-11-12,"1 thing that I loved about Avatar 1 was the implication of intricate ecosystems of virtual creatures. I&#39;m seeing so many more creatures just from these shots. They didn&#39;t have to add that many variety of underwater plants and sunfish-like creatures, but they did. It&#39;s obvious that they recognize that strength from the first movie. I am already satisfied. Just put a bunch of shot of the Navi people playing around with whales and other animals, and I&#39;ll be immensely satisfied."

The first half was like Blue Planet BBC documentary, thought that David Attenborough would come at any moment. The second half was another level.

I distinctly remember watching the first movie in the franchise when I was eight or nine, and I‚Äôm 21 now, so obviously its been ages since then. It‚Äôs cool to see that the graphics and effects have improved so much over the last 13 years or so. Its becoming more and more realistic. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and many more already have the capacity to make this film a life changing event for all of us here. The Way of the Water here we come."

Now I‚Äôm 23, and to say that I am excited for this movie is an understatement. 13 years of waiting patiently for James Cameron to finish this soon to be masterpiece and I cannot wait to see it!! Just from the trailers, photos, and clips released over the last couple months I can already tell that this movie will be worth the wait. I even got emotional watching this trailer because not only are we seeing the absolutely gorgeous visuals but it‚Äôs actually starting to feel real that we are FINALLY getting the sequel. 13 years of waiting and now it‚Äôs just a little over a month away.

"474","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The fact that in Loki he was so cheerful and joyful, but how in this he‚Äôs both calm and menacing by just a single sentence."
"475","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is such a great actor, I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU."
"476","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are. Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are. HWR is more joyous and playful, especially when he still held the cards. Kang is more proud in his speaking, it has a sort of power, like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to, and his speaking is so cold too. Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor"
"477","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The micro verse looks absolutely gorgeous props to the VFX team"
"478","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I&#39;m obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang. The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles. Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years."
"479","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-12-15,"this is by far the best movie trailer song ive ever heard. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was somehow composed so so amazingly to the trailer I just can&#39;t stop watching it"
"480","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I love Kang&#39;s composure. Looks so calm as if his intentions are pure but he desires to cause mass destruction ü§£"
"481","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I love how Kang sounds so calm, yet at the same time so terrifying...üòÆ"
"482","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors has been killing it with Lovecraft Country, Loki, Creed 3 and now Antman 3 and Avengers 5. Happy he‚Äôs getting recognition."
"483","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"My favourite part was when Hank Pym told Scott &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;"
"484","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is a fantastic actor. He&#39;s very talented and has incredible screen presence. There&#39;s a special aura to him every time he appears in something. He looks great as Kang The Conqueror, a villain who I&#39;ve been waiting to see adapted for a long time. I&#39;m very happy for the success he&#39;s having."
"485","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"It is truly amazing how he went all the way from civil war to this. He has come a long way."
"486","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The last time Hank told Scott that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility &quot;I almost cried at the cinema <br>üò≠Can&#39;t wait to see the new SpiderMan movie."
"487","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-28,"Feel like this is gonna be more serious than the previous 2 movies. Which is a nice change of pace, where the ambiance matches the situation. As opposed to the last thor movie where the stakes were drastic, but everyone was somehow trying to be funny. Scott cares about his family more than anything, and now they are all in danger, and Kang seems to be offering a solution."
"488","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I can&#39;t express how much I&#39;m excited for this new spider-man movie"
"489","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"JM as Kang is intimidating af, same as Thanos this is 100% perfect casting"
"490","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I can already tell that Majors is gonna absolutely kill it as Kang.  This is gonna be amazing!!!!"
"491","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Thank you Spider-man ‚ù§"
"492","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"It‚Äôs wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that this version of Kang has an entirely different aura about him than the He Who Remains version in Loki. Really looking forward to Jonathan‚Äôs performances with the character!"
"493","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists ? The visuals are stunning !"
"494","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"This movie looks like it&#39;ll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise. I&#39;m so excited to see Jonathan Majors again. He&#39;s so charismatic and I love that  we&#39;ll be seeing different versions of Kang<br><br>Edit: I understand big picture is always in the MCU as a whole but I just meant for kang dynasty and secret wars"
"495","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Kang&#39;s lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here. I&#39;m so excited!"
"496","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Okay but the orchestrated version of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road just makes this so phenomenal"
"497","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Really excited to see Jonathan Majors play Kang. He did extremely well as he who remains, and I can already tell he&#39;s gonna deliver with this one too!"
"498","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Kang is going to play such a huge part, I&#39;m hoping his actor makes slight change to every Kang variant to make em unique"
"499","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The fact that we&#39;re getting TWO spiderman movies in such a short amount of time is crazy. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
"500","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal. Mavel&#39;s ability to make killer trails is amazing. Can&#39;t wait for this to come out!!"
"501","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"The actor really nailed the Kang vibe. He is practically dripping in it."
"502","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-26,"Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John&#39;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; into the &quot;Loki&quot; theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road. Beautifully done. üíñ üëè"
"503","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-12-01,"I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me"
"504","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Kang is such a good name to just scream at the heavens like he‚Äôs getting away every time, just something about it. Shaking my fist into the air."
"505","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"I can&#39;t wait to watch this. Ant-Man is such a well developed character that I don&#39;t think gets enough love."
"506","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"This looks awesome. Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we‚Äôve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe, it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie."
"507","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"When spider man says: &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility&quot; i felt that, truly a great moment"
"508","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits, i&#39;m so excited for this movie!!"
"509","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I can‚Äôt imagine any other actor playing the role none other than Paul Rudd himself.<br><br><br>What a great Spider-Man"
"510","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Scott being at the forefront of Kang debut is epic."
"511","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Yes! I personally love the Ant Man movies. I think they&#39;re very underappreciated. And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was!!!"
"512","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The music selection is, once again, on point. Kudos to Marvel for always hitting the nail on the head with these."
"513","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-29,"‚ÄúWith small size comes great responsibility‚Äù <br>I will never forget these wise words."
"514","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is killin&#39; it as Kang! Honestly, I cannot wait to see more of him in these movies. What a phenominal presence he brings!<br>Just seeing that he&#39;s 2 years older than me and, man, do I feel unaccomplished!"
"515","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Can&#39;t wait for Spider-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania!! Looks really good! Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too, he&#39;s heavily underrated."
"516","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The visuals are gonna be insaneüî•üî•, and Kang looks intimidating af."
"517","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"This is going to be THE film that finally brings everything together for phase 4 and paved the way for what we are really starting to head towards and I cannot wait"
"518","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"this actually looks crazy compared to the other ant-man movies, phase 5 couldn‚Äôt come soon enough"
"519","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re lucky enough to get another spiderman movie so soon üòç"
"520","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I think, Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU. I love it."
"521","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"It&#39;s weird to see how far we&#39;ve come from the first ant man movie, it&#39;s one of my favorite mcu movies ever, it&#39;s self contained, had an awesome soundtrack and worked perfectly in such a huge universe and now suddenly by the 3rd movie he&#39;s working with Kang."
"522","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"From worlds best grandma to spider-man<br><br>This man&#39;s evolution is unparalleled"
"523","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"When Kang said ‚ÄúI can get you home and give you more time if you help me so what‚Äôs it gonna be? Ant Man.‚Äù It literally gives me goosebumps I really hope Kangs Debut is worth it because Jonathan Majors is a such a brilliant actor."
"524","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"That first scene was incredibly epic!<br>Seeing Kang gave me chills.<br>They might be skimping on CGI on Disney+ to save money, but I&#39;m relieved to see they aren&#39;t pulling punches with the CGI here. Looks incredible.<br>Really looking forward to this."
"525","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"The entire trailer is summed up in a single sentence: &quot;Thank you Spider-Man&quot;üòá"
"526","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"What I love about Kang is , that he has no powers , is no strong alien or something else . He is just smart and one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe . I just love that"
"527","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I wasn&#39;t expecting this to look so good. It felt like it was going to be a throw away film to get Kang in proper but it seems like a solid film."
"528","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"Even from a few seconds in this trailer, you can see Jonathan Majors‚Äô incredible range. His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic, aloof kinda vibe he‚Äôs giving off here. I‚Äôve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I‚Äôm already blown away by him."
"529","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"I&#39;ve always felt like the Ant-Man movies are super underrated. I&#39;m very excited for this next one!"
"530","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"Antman was one of the Marvel movies I wasn&#39;t really excited about on the first one, but then it had a different feel and was just so much fun I think I look the most forward to his stand alone movies. They feel like a nice break from the usual Marvel feel, but end up adding so much to the overall story arch."
"531","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"This looks amazing. Not gonna lie, I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga. It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale. Always been a fan of Peyton Reed‚Äôs Ant Man films and I feel like he‚Äôs gonna knock it out of the park with this one.<br>Edit : this didn‚Äôt age well"
"532","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-26,"The trailer and the song go together perfectly"
"533","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-25,"I love the part when Scott and Hope told Kang &quot;I&#39;m gonna put some dirt in your eye&quot; and &quot;I missed the part where that&#39;s my problem&quot;"
"534","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania",2022-10-24,"So excited to see Jonathan majors back, his portrayal of he who remains was amazing, and can‚Äôt wait to see him as Kang!"

"536","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"No one ever thought, when the original came out, that this character would jump into popular culture. That this world would intrigue people and make them interested in knowing more about it. It was so well written, so well directed. But most importantly, Keanu made this movie franchise what it is today<br>Edit: For people saying the movies are not well written, just bang bang gun fu, allow me to remind you that John Wicks character is built up long before he ever touches a gun. The intricacies in the stories are in the details of the world. The rules of the hotel. Whatt motivates these individuals to break/ follow those rules? The writing Is much deeper than just mindless shooting."
"537","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-11,"The fact that Donnie Yen, Keanu Reeves, and Hiroyuki Sanada can still move like this at their age is going to get me into martial arts training.<br><br>Edit: the people replying ‚Äústunt doubles‚Äù to this assume that the rest of us are not smart enough to be aware of the existence of stuntmen. Here‚Äôs a shocker: we know. <br><br>The fact is that those guys can move in a manner that is atypical for their ages, and what they all have in common is martial arts training. Stop being internet smartasses."
"538","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"Part of what makes the John Wick series so memorable is the portrayal of the unique culture of the underworld with its hierarchy, rules, scope, etc. It completely sidesteps all the typical mafia tropes we&#39;ve come to expect from Hollywood, I look forward to seeing more of that in this latest film. Oh and also watching Keanu generously distributing copious amounts of lead and death to random bad guys."
"539","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"john wick is one of the only franchises i can never get tired of, they always find a way to keep it fresh"
"540","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"Let&#39;s be honest Keanu Reeves has been a beacon right now. This man is such a humble human. He deserves EVERY role he gets and has.

"544","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"The story for this franchise is getting deeper while the action gets even crazier. I can already see that the hand to hand combat in this movie is on another level. Knowing Keanu, he probably trained really hard for this."
"545","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-11,"As good as this series is, the story, the action, the intricacies of it, I truly believe none of it would be possible without the unbelievable dedication of Keanu Reeves. He puts EVERYTHING on the table every time."
"546","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-12,"I love that every movie in this series has an iconic muscle car attached to it‚Ä¶ the Chevelle, the Mustang, and now a Barracuda‚Ä¶ it all just adds to the badassery of Wick‚Äôs character."

"548","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-15,"I think the best part of all movies is when Keanu says, &quot;I&#39;m going to need a gun.&quot; And no matter what, Morpheus or anybody is always smiling. So a wholesome moment."
"549","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-11,"This might be a weird critique but I think what I love about this trailer the most is how well-lit all the scenes are. I‚Äôm tired of action movies/scenes being so dark and impossible to see. Being able to see every actor/stunt person in the scene makes the choreography and directing more impressive when you can actually see what‚Äôs happening."

"571","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-25,"This is one of those rare franchises that takes what it made from the first movie and just expands and expands without watering down anything. Over the top action, a decent story, and pure Keanu humbleness and finesse."

"591","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-12-06,"The choreography of this franchise and the wide shots. The pure trust the director has in the work is incredible and refreshing beyond belief. Best action and none if not majority of it isn&#39;t somewhat practical. Keanu moves like this at an actual range! The lore isn&#39;t given to you all magically and all at once. We thought we wouldn&#39;t have a sequel to the first and oh were we so so wrong. Can&#39;t wait for march."
"592","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"I&#39;ve always been a fan of Keanu&#39;s work, and this looks like it&#39;s gonna take it to the next level yet again. MY BODY IS READY"

"601","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-11,"This movie series is like fine wine, it&#39;s just getting better with time, just like Keanu. He is what made this movie series exciting and thrive to still have us wanting more after every one so far. I swear I got the chills when I saw the end of this trailer.

"603","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-11,"Utmost respect for Keanu and his acting regiment, (what he does to prepare for a roll is far beyond the scope of most). As for a John Wick 4 - I can confidently say it is going to be as awesome as expected."
"604","John Wick: Chapter 4",2022-11-10,"John Wick is one of those rare franchises where every single film in the franchise is bigger AND BETTER then the one that preceded it. This looks to be yet another example of it. I&#39;m glad that Keanu found a 2nd wind in his career and glad that he&#39;s getting all the love and respect that he deserves in this franchise/as a whole with the public. He truly deserves it. Can&#39;t wait for Chapter 4 and the Potentially planned Chapter 5."

It didn&#39;t last long admittedly: turned out arriving to work on horseback in sweaty, dirty clothes, being handy in a punch up, and pulling my female co-workers in a for kiss whenever they started shouting at me, didn&#39;t go down too well at the museum."

"829","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"This book was ACTUALLY a decent prequel and a decent villian backstory. Truly proves protagonist doesn‚Äôt mean good guy, just main character. Excited to see this on the big screen."

"835","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-29,"Just finished the book (literally two minutes ago) so ofc I had to run to this trailer. I&#39;m very excited but a little worried, just because of how vital Snow&#39;s inner monologe is in the book. It&#39;s crazy how often I found myself root for him and then snap out of it, at least until the last third of the book. But even then, some of his interactions were still morally &quot;good&quot;. Crazy good writing tbh. everyone&#39;s a good guy in their own mind and Collins captured that mental divide between Snow&#39;s actions and his thought patterns perfectly. So i hope they find a way to accurately portray this in the movie!"
"836","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"The trailer looks amazing way better than what I was expecting, the fact that they stayed true to Lucy Gray&#39;s southern accent made me so happy, the arena looks so eerie  and Donald Sutherland voice at the end tying everything together chef&#39;s kiss, I&#39;m so excited for this film"

Love the dystopian look of the world, the arena of them running through the tunnels makes me think of the Running Man. Can&#39;t wait to see this, and now I need to finish reading the book.  And Snows quote at the end, chills . . . ."
"840","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"I grew up with these books and movie series...it brings back so many memories. The first time I watched The Hunger Games Movie I was at the hospital at 11 years old, then the second movie I was 13 and went with ALL my classmates and when the last came out I was around 15 and it was like closing a cycle. Now I&#39;m 21...time just flies. Ready to see this"

"842","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-09-22,"So I‚Äôm currently reading the book, chapter 8, and  I‚Äôm really loving how much of an unreliable narrator Snow actually is. He is beyond delusional, which works really well in writing. I am a little concerned of how well that will actually translate on screen. He‚Äôs very good at saying all is right, empathetic, things, and dialogue, but his internal thoughts are would give away how absolutely out of touch. I really hope they do a good job conveying all of this without excessive voiceover. I also can‚Äôt wait for all of their fucking names to be said out loud, because I can‚Äôt pronounce a single one of themmmmmm"
"843","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-06-29,"I just finished the book a couple days ago, and I think it‚Äôs remarkable how every single frame of this trailer can be matched almost exactly to a moment from the book.

"844","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"Hearing Donald Sutherland&#39;s voice at the end there gave me chills. I almost cried. I grew up with this franchise, and now it&#39;s back ‚ù§üêçüò≠"
"845","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"The capitol visually looked like it was set in a dystopian 1950s.

"846","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-02,"Snow was one of the most feared characters I‚Äôve read and seen. For me as a teenager, Snow‚Äôs character was written so well, it was just so scary and smart and wicked, God I was insane wanting to know more about how comes someone be this way. <br><br>Having the opportunity to see Snow growing into this hideous heartless old man we know would be so damn interesting <br><br>I can‚Äôt wait <br>On my way to but the book cause I need to know!!"

"850","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-11-15,"I never read the books. But I know that her Hanging Tree song was about Snow. Her being a player for D12 and singing that song must‚Äôve made things hard when he went against Katniss. Katniss used the song to be about rebellion and it was used against him. And a player from D12 who bows similar to Lucy.<br><br>I‚Äôm so excited to see this movie!"
"851","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-01,"Still shocked at the no reappearance of District 8 Hospital Helper, a phenomenal actor who deserved to be seen more in the big screen. No matter where he currently is or doing, I hope he finds the same success and fame as he once had."
"852","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"as a fan of the book this looks PERFECT. perfect casting, scenes in the trailer look exactly how i pictured them in the book, the whole vibe of the early capitol.. so excited"

"857","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-01,"The  nostalgia hits hard, I cant wait for this. Very interested with Snow&#39;s backstory knowing how messed up he turned out to be. And donald sutherland&#39;s voiceline was the bomb, he played snow so damn well."
"858","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"the book was so damn good it left me with goosebumps. highly recommend reading it before watching the movie!"
"859","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-05,"It is very good that they even touched Capitol aestethics. While in Katniss&#39; timeline, Capitol people having extravagant fashion with too many plastic surgeries. But in Snow&#39;s youth, their style resembles retro and they wear more modest clothing. Such a good detail üëçüèª"
"860","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-03,"I&#39;m surprised at how accurate the trailer seems for a book adaptation. I hope it will get to impress me as much as the book did"
"861","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-01,"One of the things I always hated about dystopians was their focus on character love stories instead of the interworkings of the world. So I‚Äôm really pumped about learning the history and lore behind the world we saw in the og trilogy"

You&#39;ll be surprised. The protagonist is not only well developed, there are also quite interesting secondary characters"
"866","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-09-24,"Back here after reading the book. Never was I so repelled by a protagonist, but invested in their story all the same. Learning about the hanging tree was so satisfying, thinking how Katniss would have annoyed him with her Mockingjay pin and the song ü§£"
"867","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"See, this is how you do it! You take a franchise/saga and you explode its potential by deepening in its story background, looking on the past and future of it. You don&#39;t make a new version of something that already exist! I&#39;m loving this new way of watching the Hunger Games world, thank you! I was really missing this type of dystopian movies!"
"868","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"I was expecting the film to be good but WOW this actually looks brilliant and way better than what I was expecting."

Not to mention Viola Davis!"
"871","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"there&#39;s just nothing that does it for me like dystopians do... This trailer takes me back to divergent and obviously hunger games when they first premiered and were announced, im actually genuinely excited for this. this trailer looks amazing!!"
"872","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"&quot;It&#39;s the things that we love most that destroy us&quot;... Now it all makes sense. Why Snow is the way he is.

"873","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-29,"As someone who read the book and loved Lucy‚Äôs character, casting Rachel Zegler in her role is literally the perfect pick."

"875","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"When young Snow said &quot;I do my best to take care of you&quot; with the head tilt and eyebrow raise. I was immediately convinced that it was Snow. The actor already has me sold!"
"876","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-07-13,"I can picture the ending showing a transition from young Snow looking at a photo of Lucy to old Snow as he prepares to talk to Katniss  in the scene where the rebels raid the tribute center and it ends with him giving the line ‚Äúit‚Äôs the things we love most that destroy us!‚Äù Now with the audience understanding the meaning of the line."
"877","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-27,"Honestly didn‚Äôt imagine the stadium to look like this in comparison with the book, but I‚Äôm all for a compact arena. The snake scene‚Äôs gonna be epic."
"878","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-28,"One of the best hunger games books in the series. I really hope the movie will do the book justice! It is truly a brilliant story. Susan Collins is a genius!"
"879","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-29,"From the trailer it seems like they will fit the entire book into one movie. Wasn‚Äôt sure if they would try to split it up into two parts. I am very excited! As criminal as this sounds, Snow has always been my favorite character. Such a sophisticated character, and Donald Sutherland portrayed that so well!"
"880","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-30,"Where is District 8 hospital helper??? He was the glue that held this franchise together!"

"883","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-04-30,"This movie looks incredible.<br>It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t see the opportunity to bring back district 8 hospital helper. I would&#39;ve loved to see his backstory and learn how his early  life shaped him into becoming the man he was. Perhaps they&#39;re planning a spin-off movie (TV show?) for his character, I don&#39;t see any other real explanation for how the producers could leave such a massive gap in the franchise."
"884","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-09,"Is anyone else watching this trailer and not seeing actors, but only seeing real, fleshed out characters? Everyone just looks exactly like the legendary Suzanne Collins described them!!! Oh my god I&#39;m so excited!!! Really hope they justice to the masterpiece that is this book."

"889","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes",2023-05-01,"These books are so difficult to put to screen given how deeply they&#39;re about someone&#39;s inner most thoughts and trauma, but the shot at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDE6Uz73A7g&amp;t=109"">1:49</a> has sold me to at least see this once. That&#39;s a gorgeous shot and is very in line with the book. The last third of this should be really great viewing on the big screen if they can do the tension right. The cast seems great."

"940","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-04-27,"The recent death of Kevin Conroy made me realize the mortality of some of our favorite celebrities. Peter isn‚Äôt going to be around forever, and if this is his last time voicing Optimus, I thank him for literally voicing my childhood"
"941","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-04-27,"It‚Äôs like opening your toy box if you‚Äôre a Transformers fan from the ‚Äò80‚Äôs/‚Äò90‚Äôs and just going out in the yard to play, but now it‚Äôs on the big screen for everyone to enjoy üòä together at once with each other from both generations of Transformers fans."

She passed away before she could see Bumblebee or the actual film version of Unicron(the other movie said he WAS Earth, which made her so angry). Wish she was here to see this.

"952","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-05-12,"One fun fact about Peter Cullen is that he was inspired to create the voice of Optimus Prime after his brother, who was a Marine Corps drill instructor. Cullen has stated that his brother&#39;s commanding voice and way of speaking influenced his portrayal of the heroic Autobot leader. Additionally, Cullen&#39;s deep, resonant voice has made him a sought-after voice actor, and he has provided voices for many other popular animated shows and video games, including the character of Eeyore in Disney&#39;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh.&quot;"
"953","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-05-07,"I am proud of Peter Cullen to still voice for Optimus Prime, He is a living LEGEND!"

"956","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-04-27,"I actually like that Unicron is being introduced earlier on. It could give the writers a chance to use other big bads of the franchise, like the Vok, BW Megatron or an evil prime"
"957","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-05-01,"Seeing Acree and Wheeljack fighting together really does remind me of an episode of transformers primne. This movie is definitely going to be a blast!"
"958","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-04-27,"I&#39;m honestly not expecting to see a robot mode for Unicron, but, it&#39;s still pretty cool to see a pretty accurate looking planet mode of him."

"961","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",2023-04-27,"The greatest thing that set Bumblebee apart from the other transformers movies was the action &amp; characters being much clearer, also the humans having interesting &amp; important connection to the story &amp; not just being there to be there."

"969","Creed III",2022-10-20,"Jonathan Majors has a certain ferocity while also being sympathetic and tender in these roles. He&#39;s an amazing actor"
"970","Creed III",2022-10-18,"I love the fact that Major‚Äôs character is an old friend of Adonis that went to prison. Think that‚Äôs such a great twist and can have huge emotional impact when they do fight, if done right. Look‚Äôs like Majors is playing almost a Tyson like figure."
"971","Creed III",2022-10-18,"I can respect this, it‚Äôs no longer about the past of rocky meeting the present, it‚Äôs all about Adonis and his own life. Can‚Äôt wait for this to hit theatres!"
"972","Creed III",2022-11-20,"&quot;I need you to let go of your fear, let go of the guilt, let go of whatever was, and walk into what is &quot; .... omg the chills I get from this line !!!"
"973","Creed III",2022-10-22,"One thing that a lot of people don&#39;t talk about but can be noticed in this trailer is the evolution of Duke Jr, he was ignorant with Adonis in the first movie and in the sequel he wasn&#39;t experienced enough to train him for the first Drago fight, now, he finally seems to have the balance to become a perfect manager, just like his father was for Apollo and Rocky, pretty awesome."
"974","Creed III",2023-02-04,"Man this Kang is in every multiverse"
"975","Creed III",2022-10-18,"The first creed came out in a time of my life where I needed motivation. I love both Rocky and Creed."
"976","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Love Majors‚Äô acting even in these small snippets. That smiling exterior contrasted with a lifetime of hurt and loss that he just barely keeps under the surface. He‚Äôs practically got layered antagonists down to a science"
"977","Creed III",2022-12-10,"I remember taking my father to the movie theaters to see Creed when he was in good health. I remember taking him to see Creed 2 when his health started to decline. Though I can‚Äôt physically take him with me to see Creed 3, I know he will be there and this will be a tough one to watch especially. But very excited for the progress of these films and Michael B Jordan is killing it. Stay humble folks"
"978","Creed III",2023-02-09,"I worked on this movie towards the ending of filming last year and I‚Äôm still pinching myself over it, such a surreal and positive experience, everyone involved was so dope üôè"
"979","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Love how this story has been progressing: In the first 2, Adonis grew into his own person, learning victory and humility. Now that he‚Äôs fully at the top, Damian‚Äôs coming in to challenge Adonis on whether or not he <b>deserves</b> his life. Brilliant story telling."
"980","Creed III",2022-10-18,"I thought I would miss seeing Rocky in this trailer, but the introduction of Major&#39;s character is a great angle to explore. Smart move. I feel like Creed 3 will really step out of the shadows and be its own entity. So hyped!"
"981","Creed III",2022-10-25,"That change in Majors‚Äô facial expression when he says ¬´¬†thank you¬†¬ª is elite !"
"982","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Despite not having Rocky back this time around I think it‚Äôll still be great. Rocky‚Äôs story already came to an end and he‚Äôs passed the torch on to Adonis. Now this time around it‚Äôs really a personal battle, maybe even more so than the Drago fight. There‚Äôs a lot of history here, and it seems like it‚Äôs definitely be a great character piece. Can‚Äôt wait to see it"
"983","Creed III",2022-10-18,"I like the fact that this film is going in its own lane and not being predictable. Its sort of leaving the rocky and apollo shadows behind in a respectful way, even in the trailer at the gym it has written on back wall &quot;build your own legacy&quot; and this film is doing just that. Excellent job!"
"984","Creed III",2022-10-21,"2023 is a big year for Jonathan Majors, so happy for him and Congrats to Michael B. Jordan for his directorial debut!"

"986","Creed III",2022-10-19,"Jonathan Majors is perfect for a villain who  acts friendly with a smile, but it has a double/hidden meaning, and it comes off eerie because it&#39;s too friendly with his calm demeanor. And only later do we see the true nature (evil/anger) behind it. Not evil in this movie, I&#39;m mainly referring to Kang."
"987","Creed III",2022-10-18,"A little hesitant to not see anything related to Rocky‚Äôs history at first, but this is Creed‚Äôs legacy now. His own story with an opponent from his own past with nothing to lose. Major‚Äôs character Damien is seen always alone in his training and even down to the showdown with no one in his corner, while Creed has everything he needs. Perfect story of ‚Äúeverything on the line‚Äù VS ‚Äúnothing to lose‚Äù. This is gonna be fun"

"990","Creed III",2022-10-18,"When Major‚Äôs say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in the diner‚Ä¶ I seen the switch. That little nuanced bit of acting is so good! These two will push each other beyond a ‚Äúfight‚Äù movie!"
"991","Creed III",2022-10-20,"Cant lie, jonathan majors being in this gave me chills, from the trailer alone you can tell he&#39;s fit the role real good, congrats to MBJ for is directorial debut, this film looks like its going to be epic!"
"992","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Now this is what I‚Äôm talking about, a brand new story that doesn‚Äôt follow a lot of the Rocky story but still acknowledges it. <br>No sons of passed characters, and no ties that butchers the rocky legacy. Can‚Äôt wait to see this."

"996","Creed III",2022-10-18,"gotta say im proud of michael having this movie as his directional debut. It already lookss OUTSANDINGS"
"997","Creed III",2022-10-19,"Holy crow, Jonathan Majors absolutely killing it in this trailer. I don&#39;t think you could get much more of a polar opposite from his work on Lovecraft Country than what you see here. Don&#39;t know that he&#39;ll outshine MBJ, but he&#39;ll definitely give him a run for his money in every respect!"
"998","Creed III",2022-10-18,"I loved both Creed movies and honestly I really hope this lives up to those.  And honestly I do get the idea of making this one; though the first Creed was about Adonis proving he is his own person and can get his own shot and II was about facing the demons of his father&#39;s legacy not drag him down in what he wants to do, it did feel like we needed a movie specifically about an enemy and an obstacle that relates squarely to him and something he couldn&#39;t just rely on a mentor helping him get past.  Like Rocky has a really great ending in Creed II to his story so I get wanting to separate him from this story and have it be about something specifically Adonis went through."
"999","Creed III",2023-02-04,"Can we please acknowledge Johnathan Majors. His come up is immaculate."
"1000","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Wait a frickin minute, that‚Äôs ‚Äúhe who remains‚Äù himself Jonathan majors. Pretty awesome he is in it."
"1001","Creed III",2022-10-18,"The conflict is giving Warrior (2011) vibes. About time we got that plot again, it&#39;s a great plot that deserves to be reinterpreted!"
"1002","Creed III",2022-10-21,"I noticed how, at the end scene in this trailer, there&#39;s whole team around Adonis, concerned about him, giving him advice, carrying for him, and there&#39;s Dame, he&#39;s standing alone, there&#39;s no one behind him, no team, no word of encouragement. He grove up as a bully with no guidance. I know many people with sad story like this one. Feel sory for this movie character already. Jonathan is very good at his job."

"1011","Creed III",2022-10-21,"I hope they also develop the Drago and his son storyline as well.  In Creed II seeing how Drago&#39;s son was so upset about how his mother abandoned them and they were left to fend for themselves.  That was the most emotional part of the story for me."
"1012","Creed III",2022-10-19,"For anyone who has seen Spiderman TAS from the 90s, this reminds me of the episode where we learn about Robbie&#39;s and Tombstone&#39;s past. As kids, they committed a crime, but only one got caught. It showed how different their lives were from that one incident."

"1015","Creed III",2022-11-10,"That initial monologue is powerful, it works both narratively and in terms of the creative process. Creed 1 and 2 were still revolving around the Rocky mythos, this is the first truly independent story,  not tied to Rocky and his rogue‚Äôs gallery. Pumped for this film."
"1016","Creed III",2022-10-18,"KILLMONGER VS KANG THE CONQUERER.<br>In all seriousness, I love the Creed franchise. I can&#39;t wait to see the third entry in the trilogy."
"1017","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Was skeptical of them doing a 3rd movie because I wasn&#39;t sure where they could go after having Creed conquer Drago. Seemed like a great way to wrap the story.

"1019","Creed III",2022-10-18,"This is great! It&#39;s a perfect and original story, no longer is this new Creed franchise hindering on the Rocky legacy, it&#39;s now really opening up to its own path."

"1021","Creed III",2022-10-18,"The fact that Ryan Googler is back on writing ( he directed the first creed and wrote it&#39;s story) is already promising. Creed 2 was great, but relatively simple as a story and pretty predicable! Hope we get to see another long take of a fight"
"1022","Creed III",2023-02-16,"I love the Rocky/Creed franchise. They did it perfectly in transition. Instead of instantly making a standalone Creed, they allowed a passing of the torch, having Rocky in 2 of them, to get fans minds used to Creed so that when they make this one, we are already on board and it is just an extension of a story that we have known for YEARS.<br><br>Don&#39;t get it twisted though...Creed will always be a branch off of Rocky. Rocky will stand forever as one of the greatest Boxing franchise movies. Creed wouldn&#39;t exist if it wasn&#39;t for the success of the former.<br><br>That being said, I am excited to see where this goes!"

I think going to see this movie in theaters it‚Äôs really important to be aware that this is Creed‚Äôs story &amp; this is his journey with his family and peers. Creed 3 is only the beginning of the Creed collection!"

"1031","Creed III",2022-10-18,"When I saw the trailer for Creed 1, that‚Äôs when I started to work out and started to be discipline and consistent and get into the best shape of my life. Every time I see a new movie for Creed, it reminds me that we‚Äôre all have a legacy to leave behind and how far we came. I hope all you guys are giving it your all in life üî•üôè"
"1032","Creed III",2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is going to be the next Denzel Washington as an actor. He has similar charisma and acting range. He even reminds me of a young Sidney Poitier in the trailers for his new movie Devotion. I‚Äôve also read about his director of Ant Man 3 comparing him to a young Marlon Brando, saying he has a very similar energy and range as an actor. Very high praise"
"1033","Creed III",2022-10-19,"I&#39;m looking forward to this, the rocky movies were great, the transition over to Creed has been excellent as well as subtle, and now also the transition into a standalone franchise away from Rocky is also great, I hope we can get a few more creed films if this succeeds, like I think it will."
"1034","Creed III",2022-10-19,"Awesome premise! They could have went the easy route and have Clubber Lang&#39;s son (or something similar to that) wanting to get his shot but no, an original idea. There were 3 years between Creed 1&amp;2. You can tell they took that extra year to put together a really good script...so looking forward to this!!!

"1043","Creed III",2022-10-19,"I feel like they took inspiration from Iron Mike when creating Johnath Major&#39;s character, from the way he&#39;s aggressive, to his built, his haircut and the prison element of the story. Gonna be an absolute blast for sure"
"1044","Creed III",2022-10-18,"Honestly me missing Rocky went out the window cuz of how much Adonis had grown out of both his fathers and Rocky‚Äôs shadows and introducing his past is the right step into the direction for this story and having his daughter grown up too is great to see cuz maybe she‚Äôll get her story sometime soon"
"1045","Creed III",2022-10-18,"This looks like it&#39;s going to be amazing. I&#39;m glad that the story is being taken in a different direction, with Adonis doing his own thing independent of Rocky and being out of his shadow. He&#39;s not in this trailer, but Florian Munteanu is supposed to reprise the character of Viktor Drago from Creed 2. I suspect he&#39;s going to help Adonis train to some extent."
"1046","Creed III",2022-10-20,"Ain‚Äôt nobody talk about this edit? It‚Äôs absolutely amazing! Whoever created this trailer needs more credit"
"1047","Creed III",2022-10-18,"&quot;There&#39;s no enemy like the past&quot;...I LOVE THAT STATEMENT!!"
"1048","Elemental",2023-03-28,"It feels like an explosion of color in every shot"
"1049","Elemental",2023-03-28,"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be together, you are different!‚Äù is obviously the message they are wishing to tear down in this movie. Looks very visually striking."
"1050","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This is the kind of quality I expect from Disney and Pixar to make. I&#39;m glad to finally get a movie that goes back to being imaginative with its characters and its world building. I definitely look forward to seeing Ember and Wade in the big screen come release day."
"1051","Elemental",2023-03-30,"Loving the animation so far. The only downside I can see in this is that it looks a ‚Äúforbidden relationship‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù type of story. And from what I‚Äôve heard a decent amount of people online are kinda tired of those type of stories. Fortunately for me I don‚Äôt care about story tropes being overdone. What matters for me is if it‚Äôs executed well or not. Hope the movie executes it well."
"1052","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Now imagine if Pixar keep doing more originals than sequels. This looks great"
"1053","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Every time there&#39;s a new movie trailer from Pixar, my inner child will come out and be leaping for joy. Every single time! Oh, it&#39;s so good to feel like a child again."
"1054","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I might not care much for the story, but this is probably one of <b>if</b> not, the most visually pleasing and beautiful movies that Pixar has made which makes it all the more worth to watch it."
"1055","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This legitimately looks really cool! Pixar has not lost its touch when it comes to the visuals and animation, and they‚Äôre showing no signs of losing it anytime soon."
"1056","Elemental",2023-03-30,"Don&#39;t get me wrong here: I love the artstyle and the choice of colour in every shot so far.<br>But the story man... we&#39;ve seen the typical &quot;I have to step into the footsteps of my parents but I never wanted to or didn&#39;t realize I didn&#39;t&quot; for like... the 50th time now. I wish big companies would not only create unqiue worlds and artstyles, but also spice up the story game a little more"
"1057","Elemental",2023-04-09,"I can&#39;t wait for these two characters to fall in love and then break up due to the pressure of their families towards the middle of the second act only to find out that they don&#39;t care about what others think by the beginning of the third act and then lecture the whole city about the wonders of loving each other&#39;s differences, thus, leading the plot to a climax where everyone learns how much richer their society can be if they mix with each other."
"1058","Elemental",2023-04-08,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm 100% sold on the story, but the animation and the creative ways these characters interact with the world will still be worth it for sure"
"1059","Elemental",2023-03-29,"I don‚Äôt know if this is going to be good or not, but I just love how each of the element people move. -The vibrations, jiggles, and bubbles in the water people -The cloud streaks left behind by the air people -The shifting of the leaves and grass on the earth people -The way the flames wave with the motion of the fire people I think this movie has some good potential. I just hope that its as good as it looks.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANo9JTH54Kc"">https://youtu.be/ANo9JTH54Kc</a>"

"1061","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Pixar never fails to impress me with their originality. And as part of Disney&#39;s 100th anniversary celebrations, I still cannot wait to see the film."
"1062","Elemental",2023-03-29,"i&#39;m not big on how the characters look but i LOVE the imaginative world building. a grill as a baby carriage? thats genius!"
"1063","Elemental",2023-04-04,"The thing that I&#39;m most excited about is the fact that all of the elements interact really well in their world, like water always wanting to be near, well, water. Fire changing color by touching the crystals is also amazing!"
"1064","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Please dont let this be bad. All I want is a good movie from Pixar. The visuals look so amazing."
"1065","Elemental",2023-04-01,"I&#39;m not entirely sure about the story and characters yet, but the animation looks INCREDIBLE and even if it does suck it&#39;ll still be worth seeing to see how far animation has come<br><br>Edit: WHY SO MANY LIKES this is crazy"
"1066","Elemental",2023-04-02,"Love how different elemental characters have their own homes and the style is magnificent."
"1067","Elemental",2023-03-28,"There‚Äôs a lot of creativity and world building within this film. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this movie"
"1068","Elemental",2023-03-28,"what would instantly make this even more original would be if they dont end up as a romantic pairing in the end, they just stay friends. Platonic stories can be beautiful and emotional too!"
"1069","Elemental",2023-03-28,"It&#39;s insane that Pixar can take a simple concept and make it look THIS beautiful!"
"1070","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Disney and Pixar need this to be a hit. I hope it&#39;s good."
"1071","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Now this is why I love Pixar so much and it‚Äôs because not only are they the Kings of animation but they can develop creative story‚Äôs of anything weather it‚Äôs humans, toys, cars, emotions, animals, elements, or anything and they‚Äôre all fantastic"
"1072","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I absolutely love the lesson of befriending others that don‚Äôt look or live like you and getting along. This is going to be such a great message!"
"1073","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I absolutely LOVE the animation here. It‚Äôs super gorgeous! Every character has an unique art style and the world looks so colorful, expressive and vibrant. The story looks cute too. I can‚Äôt wait to see this one in theaters. Pixar and Dreamworks are the kings of 3D animation."
"1074","Elemental",2023-03-29,"Pixar has almost always been hit"
"1075","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Never doubted Pixar in my life. And this looks fabulous!"
"1076","Elemental",2023-03-29,"Characters designs are incredible.<br>An excellent fusion on 3D and 3D gives elementals are &quot;drawn&quot; appearance and yet they also have a solid build.<br>I am going to enjoy this movie.<br>Pixar is getting better with every year."
"1077","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I can&#39;t wait to tear up in the cinema watching this as Pixar films always have that scene that crushes my heart in the best possible way"
"1078","Elemental",2023-04-03,"I liked the third act where the water man says, ‚ÄúI like the word moist, okay? It‚Äôs who I am, and if you can‚Äôt accept that, then what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù<br><br>Best part of this movie of all time."
"1079","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This looks WAY better than the teaser trailer! It looks way more creative and interesting than I first thought!"
"1080","Elemental",2023-03-28,"The animations on this are truly spectacular. Very well done Pixar work. Can‚Äôt wait to see this when it comes out!"
"1081","Elemental",2023-03-31,"WOW I‚Äôm surprised more people aren‚Äôt disappointed. From the trailer I can tell the whole plot. What ever happened to heart wrenching, unique, and innovative Pixar. All of their beats have unique stories with unique messages and characters. This looks like ever love story to exist but colorful. Looks visually pretty but emotionally dry"
"1082","Elemental",2023-03-29,"This movie was made for me. I‚Äôve always loved opposites attract romances. And this is literally fire and water. Amazing."
"1083","Elemental",2023-05-16,"The movie looks absolutely stunning and I have little doubt it will visually be an incredible movie. But i feel like I&#39;ve seen this plot already 10,000 times."
"1084","Elemental",2023-04-22,"I like how we all perfectly predicted the plot üò≠"
"1085","Elemental",2023-03-30,"The character designs look so beautiful and unique! Also glad to see more fire people, I thought is was going to be a &quot;last of her kind&quot; story."
"1086","Elemental",2023-03-29,"This actually looks a lot better than I expected. The way they animated the character Ember feels sort of 2D?? (especially how they animate her face throughout the trailer and at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a>). I&#39;m surprised that Wade is the character that convinces Ember to explore outside of her comfort zone and not the other way around, which is really cool. The plot doesn&#39;t feel super original, but I&#39;m kind of excited for this movie now!"
"1087","Elemental",2023-03-28,"The animation is sooo bright and fluid! Glad to see more of the fire elements.<br>Maybe the ideas of elemental people and &quot;you can be out of your element&quot; seem generic, but even clich√©s can be written in a clever and breathtaking way. I&#39;m hyped for the movie!"
"1088","Elemental",2023-04-05,"To this day even with everything Disney owns and creates; live action tv shows, feature films, etc.. nothing will ever compare to their animation studios. That‚Äôs where their magic truly shows."
"1089","Elemental",2023-04-11,"the thing that bugs me about the movie is the story is so obvious Ember &amp; Wade fall in love the people are not gonna like it because of the &quot;elements cant mix&quot; rule but in the end everyone is going to except it even if they dont like it but the animation &amp; the different elements looks so amazingly beautiful that even though the story is predictable i might watch it because of the beautiful animation<br><br><br>Edit: i have never been so happy to be wrong about a movie WOW this movie was beautiful, gorgeous animation LOVED Ember &amp; Wade&#39;s chemistry i loved how Wade lit his candle with Ember&#39;s light reflecting off himself genius i loved how Ember&#39;s color changed when she stepped on those crystals that was beautiful their little dance was beautiful just everything about this movie was beautiful"
"1090","Elemental",2023-03-28,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to fill my fathers shoes but I never once asked what I wanted to do‚Äù I already relate, and this is just the trailer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw&amp;t=103"">1:43</a>"
"1091","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Usually when a trailer for Pixar comes out, I never smiled this much üòä. I love how Pixar is experimenting with different styles of art now, and this movie sets those standards to the limit. The direction for the art is just fantastic in every scene, and the story actually seems pretty good! So in my book, this may be a movie I would want to see in theaters ^^"
"1092","Elemental",2023-03-29,"This is the kind of quality I expect from Disney and Pixar to make.

"1093","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I can tell it&#39;s already one of those movies where the main character never asks what she truly wanted and now realizes what she wants to do in her life"
"1094","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Pixar never disappoints. Always delivering best visual with best writting."
"1095","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I have no clue if the story is going to be good or not, but by far one of the most imaginative things to come from Disney and Pixar in a while"
"1096","Elemental",2023-05-18,"The story maybe cliche but the visual animation is absolutely beautiful<br><br>The animation might carry the entire movie..."
"1097","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I‚Äôm truly impressed on what Pixar made. Might be another amazing project."
"1098","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This animated feature looks pretty creative for a Pixar film"
"1099","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This is going to be one of the most incredible Pixar movies ever."
"1100","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I honestly had lot of hope for this but never thought I could feel this excited for this movie to come. The animation looks fantastic specially when Ember jumps on the crystals, that reminds me to the science classes and the story looks so good, can&#39;t wait for this to be out."
"1101","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I love how they sometime shrink, or move like the elements they are, it&#39;s so detailed"
"1102","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Hopefully this is Pixar‚Äôs comeback and they will have good movies now! This one feels like the 2014-2017 era, I hope it‚Äôs just as good!"
"1103","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Already loving the dynamic between the two main characters AND JUST LOOK AT THE ANIMATION"
"1104","Elemental",2023-04-01,"The animation, movements, and the textures of these different elemental characters and homes is incredibly beautiful. I‚Äôm so excited for this movie ‚ù§üî•üíß"

"1113","Elemental",2023-03-28,"They developed such an incredible and colorful world. I honestly cannot wait to see this movie."
"1114","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I don&#39;t know what impressed me more: The beautiful animation or the fact that a trailer didn&#39;t spoil half of its movie"
"1115","Elemental",2023-04-05,"Today is the first I&#39;ve seen anything about this film and I&#39;m stunned at the phenomenal artistry of it. In terms of theme, it reminds me quite a bit of &quot;Zootopia&quot;, right down to the inclusion of a fictional city that caters to different types of beings. But it&#39;s visually spectacular, all the same."
"1116","Elemental",2023-04-07,"The best thing is how elemental characters look in different textures and I love the imaginative world. Sliding on water and making droplets makes a rainbow is beautiful!"
"1117","Elemental",2023-03-28,"I actually really like the overall designs of the characters. I mean Ember especially looks amazing!"
"1118","Elemental",2023-04-15,"For the story concept I&#39;m not gagging, a little basic, but visually and world-building wise this looks gorgeous and entertaining"
"1119","Elemental",2023-03-28,"This is why I love Pixar. Without any hints what&#39;s next but still makes us eager to know what will be next."

"1121","Elemental",2023-03-28,"Ok, that looks pretty damn good. I mean, I know that people are starting to get tired with the realistic animation and even me so I really love that while this movie has a lot of Pixar realistic visuals it&#39;s also mixed with other styles.

"1197","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"The way we went from all the games, and with a movie that has been in development for 8 years is actually insane. We got to watch this franchise grow into this huge fandom."
"1198","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Even after 8 years FNAF is still bigger than ever! It&#39;s amazing to see what this franchise has achieved!"

"1205","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"How cool to see Cory participating in this movie, he deserves a lot, I can&#39;t believe the fnaf movie is actually happening, I still remember Markplier&#39;s videos, animations, The Living Tombstone songs and the fear of playing the games, It&#39;s so nice to know that only one guy named Scott Cawthon has managed to do all of this since 2014.. Thank You Scott and Blumhouse for this gift"
"1206","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-13,"it&#39;s insane to see how a small little game in 2014 went to being an actual movie, from a franchise to a fandom. It&#39;s been a wonderful experience"

"1210","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I‚Äôm so happy to see Cory in this. Thanks to FNAF his career became what is it now. He‚Äôs touched so many people and inspired millions and then some. It‚Äôs amazing to see the community giving Cory a well deserved place in the film.<br><br><b>UPDATE</b><br>A lot of people have been arguing about wether Cory really deserved the role. Some say it should be markiplier, which I totally understand, considering Cory isn‚Äôt the only one to stream FNAF and make the fan base what it is now, however, we must understand that this is a very subjective opinion that varies from person to person, so we shouldn‚Äôt bother finding the right answer, because there isn‚Äôt one. No matter who truly deserved it, the movie will still be a banger and I can‚Äôt wait to see it!!"
"1211","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-01,"It‚Äôs truly amazing to see how far 5 nights at Freddy‚Äôs has come and how it went from a viral 2014 horror game to a franchise worth over $70 million"
"1212","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I watched Cory since 2016 when he had less than a million subscribers and every video i watched made me smile. Now it‚Äôs 2023 he has over 16 million subscribers and now is featured in a movie and I can not show how much I am so proud of him of how much he grew. He truly is the shogun!!"
"1213","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"I screamed so loud when Cory appeared. So glad he‚Äôs getting the recognition he deserves. Such a great cameo."
"1214","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-30,"I love how fnaf is definitely NOT a game for children, but those kids are now adults and can go see a movie which will probably not be for kids either. I love it"
"1215","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-29,"The fact that Blumhouse brought in Scott Cawthon to write the story and help with the screenplay is a MAJOR W. So many movies with lots of potential have been ruined by directors and writers who don&#39;t know anything about the source material. This doesn&#39;t seem to be one of those instances at all. So excited to see this on the big screen!!"
"1216","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Finally!! One of the biggest dreams of FNAF fans, is here!! I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s going to be good or bad, we have a movie about the game. Thanks for that Scott and Blumhouse, it&#39;s amazing."
"1217","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"I love Cory so seeing him in this movie is truly amazing. He‚Äôs come so far from playing fnaf in his parents house to actually being in the movie. Props to you Cory üëèüéâ"
"1218","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-01,"I hope it‚Äôs not too cheesy. The fnaf games were honestly really scary, and the plot behind it was really interesting and in depth. I always said the fnaf games had a lot of potential on the big screen if done right, just hope it delivers"
"1219","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-06,"it‚Äôs so surreal being a fan of this little indie game back in 2014, to watch it develop and eventually become a full blown movie"
"1220","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"It&#39;s amazing how far Scott and the franchise has come. In less than a decade, a movie was born from such a simple yet terrifying indie game, and you can really tell how much love went into this. They have come so far and deserve it all. I&#39;m so happy that Scott even gave a little bit of credit to the youtubers that always played all the amazing games he made."
"1221","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I remember a &#39;few&#39; years ago when there were rumours about a film, but to actually see a trailer is a whole different experience - crazy how far this franchise has come."
"1222","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-30,"As a Cory fan, him getting a cameo in a movie based off of a game that made his YT career after all these years is nice to see, even if its a small role, he was damn excited for it."
"1223","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-21,"the fact that the animatronics very accurately depict the ones from the original game gives me hope that this movie is going to be good."
"1224","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Never thought I&#39;d live to see the day a movie happens. So many of us have been with this community from day 1 of the first game. The actors look and sound amazing and the sets are perfect. Looking forward to dressing up for the launch date and really taking this in! Congratulations Scott!"
"1225","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Proud of Cory and how far he&#39;s come in his career. Went from playing FNAF to being in one for real."
"1226","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"We‚Äôre proud of you, Scott, for making a beast of an indie series. Thanks for all you‚Äôve done, and here‚Äôs hoping the movie is a smash hit."
"1227","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-29,"It feels bittersweet seeing this, perhaps knowing this is Scott&#39;s last big project with the franchise, but no matter what I&#39;ll still be apart of this community no matter how crappy it gets, I WILL respect Scott, he has done so many things in the lives of others thanks to this franchize. thank you Scott, thank you, SteelWool, thank you cast, and thank you Universal/blumhouse for letting the biggest game of our lives become a movie. I didnt think this would become a movie and yet im so happy it did.<br><br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: I think you guys misunderstood what i said with his last projects, I said its gonna be his last BIG project and i know he&#39;s gonna be working behind the scenes, it means that he wont be the one giving updates and interacting with the community anymore"
"1228","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"One of the first things I watched after I created my youtube account in 2015 was Markiplier‚Äôs FNAF series. 9 year old me was quickly obsessed, and 8 years later, it‚Äôs incredible to see how far the fanbase and franchise has gone. The first fandom I was truly apart of! My friends and I knew EVERYTHING about the lore‚Ä¶.."
"1229","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"Even though FNAF‚Äôs lore can be complicated, let‚Äôs all agree that Cory‚Äôs cameo could actually be one of the biggest plot points the lore has ever given us and actually makes sense."
"1230","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Not the biggest FNAF fan, but I‚Äôm definitely amazed with how far this franchise has come, from a indie game on steam to a full blown movie"
"1231","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"The fact they included Corey as a cameo for the movie makes this many times better to the point that many of us will want to see the movie even more at this point"
"1232","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"The theme song sends chills down my back. Great work everyone who worked hard to get this movie to actually happening for the past 8 years!"
"1233","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-09,"I hope Scott makes a voice message for the guard just like in the games. I have a feeling that this is going to be an outstanding video game adaptation!"
"1234","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-09,"It&#39;s incredible how they made the animatronics almost precisely on point to the game! Seriously mad respect for those who put so much time and effort into making the animatronics!"
"1235","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"Congrats to Scott Cawthon and CoryxKenshin bro. They‚Äôve come so far it‚Äôs baffling. It‚Äôs so crazy to see how some random game developer and some small YouTube content creator from 2014 have both made greatness and have risen eachother to fame. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Cory and a huge fan of the fnaf franchise. It nearly brings a tear to my eye knowing that I used to watch Cory when I was young and watch gameplays of this game as a young kid. Now I‚Äôm a teen and I got to whiteness how far they‚Äôve come. Once again, congrats to Cory and Scott for making this movie even possible. Much love to both of them ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"1236","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-09,"Could you imagine a world, where fnaf never blew up? A world where the community dropped the story and it faded to obscurity?<br>Its amazing to see so much come from something that was so small.<br>And I think the best part is that OG fans really feel like we made this happen. We kept this series alive and now it&#39;s going to go on to do great things.<br>Its almost like raising a child <br>A horrifying, murderous child."
"1237","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"It‚Äôs amazing seeing Cory get recognized he deserves it, it‚Äôs mind blowing watching him play every single masterpiece Scott which he‚Äôs a genius by the way. Every game he‚Äôs created to watching him be in the first official movie and from the looks of it this movie isn‚Äôt gonna disappoint."
"1238","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"The fact that this started as an indie game is amazing by itself. This really looks like the game brought to life."
"1239","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Seeing Cory at the end of trailer genuinely made me smile, it just amazes me to see him on the big screen in a movie about a game series that he‚Äôs loved since the beginning"
"1240","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Scott and Blumhouse, just by including people from the FNAF community, a massive round of applause to you. You understand and appreciate the people that made this movie happen. Regardless of good or not, this movie scored major points just through that."
"1241","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"It‚Äôs great seeing Cory getting the recognition he deserves, getting a cameo in the official fnaf movie is insane"
"1242","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"I‚Äôm so proud of you Cory . I‚Äôm so happy for him !! He deserves the world ‚ù§"
"1243","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-30,"Can we just appreciate how good the animatronics look so similar to the actual game?"
"1244","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I&#39;m not a big Fnaf fan, but I hope this does well to keep building momentum for better video game movie adaptations in the future."
"1245","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"seeing cory this made me really shed a tear... he&#39;s came so far and worked so hard, i cant stomach how proud i am for him"
"1246","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-08-14,"I was a 10 year old kid when FNAF was first released and I loved it. The first time a horror game interested me as a young kid. I remember the times with my older brother and younger me watching youtubers playing the game on youtube and how my classmates/friends would talk about FNAF in elementary school 4th grade back then. I am now 19 years old and will definitely watch the upcoming movie itself. And honestly, I just find it &quot;awesome&quot; to know and see kids of today&#39;s generation getting into Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, just as we older people did as kids back then.<br><br>Edit: What the heck&#39;s going on in the comment section here?<br><br>..... Oh well, it&#39;s the internet anyways."
"1247","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-30,"This looks really interesting! Here&#39;s hoping the movie will be just as good as the games! üòÉ"
"1248","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Scott started as a basic game developer to help his family. Now he has an entire team that will bring Freddy to the big screen. Just goes to show that big things can start small, and will grow if you put effort and dedication into it. The animatronics look perfect, Springtrap will make a spine-chilling appearance, and the cinematography and story look fantastic. I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs happening. But here we are, standing proudly beside Scott to see how far we‚Äôve come as a a community."
"1249","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"I remember growing up with this franchise, being addicted to the lore. Happy to see that it got a movie. Even if the movie turns out mediocre, still pretty crazy to know this all started as a simple indie game.<br><br>Congrats Scott!!"
"1250","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-29,"There&#39;s one thing some people missed. Golden Freddy&#39;s eyes normally indicate the 2 spirits in the animatronic in the games. Here in the trailer, we see that one of Golden Freddy&#39;s eyes is missing. Which might indicate that 1 of the souls in Golden Freddy is missing. We also know that the Crying Child is more friendly compared to Cassidy. Cassidy in UCN is torturing William forever, while the Crying Child lets go, and leaves the animatronic. Which probably means Cassidy is missing, and the one blue eye is the Crying Child. Which could be the reason Golden Freddy is not after Abby."
"1251","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I hope the community takes this well. I personally think it looks FANTASTIC!! As a die hard FNAF fan I‚Äôm okay with the story changing slightly for a movie adaptation. Let it be it‚Äôs own thing. Between the games, books, and now A MOVIE (finally!!) Five nights at Freddy‚Äôs tells a chilling story with not every question having an answer‚Äîwhich I think is exactly what Scott wanted to do in the first place with it. And that‚Äôs exactly why people have been coming back to it years later. Congrats to Scott and BlumHouse and the team for finally fulfilling our dreams of seeing our favorite animatronics on the big screen!!!"
"1252","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-17,"I‚Äôm so glad to have been part of this journey as a fan. From Game Theory Videos to Markiplier gameplay; I‚Äôve been an enthusiast of FNAF content of all kinds, books included. It‚Äôs amazing to see how far we‚Äôve come!<br><br>Edit: woah, thanks for 1k‚Ä¶fr"
"1253","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"The music fits perfectly with the movie trailer. It gives you chills when you see the abandoned place and a old VHS tape plays. When the lady was speaking, you could see how this place has been torn down but the animatronics still look pretty new."
"1254","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"to be honest I don&#39;t care if its bad I just wanna finally see the movie come out and watch it. Its been 8 years since the movie was announced and after many set backs we finally have a confirmed date and everything seems to be ready and the trailer and teaser are absolutely amazing."
"1255","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"From an indie game developer to a FNAF creator, it goes to show that his dedication to the franchise is still intact."
"1256","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"It&#39;s actually INSANE that this movie is almost here. I remember watching Markiplier&#39;s original FNAF videos on my 3DS back in 2014. I was in 5th grade then, now I am beginning my second year of college. THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!!!!"
"1257","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"And to think this franchise started with a man who took negative reviews over how scary his game is and turned it around and made it into this masterpiece and 8 years later it‚Äôs a movie. Hats off to you Scott Cawthon! üòâ"
"1258","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"&quot;When the night shift starts, the nightmare begins&quot;<br>The perfect phrase to describe this franchise<br>Let&#39;s go for the 10 years!<br>And let&#39;s make this movie a hit!"

"1261","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-28,"I remember as a kid watching markiplier play fnaf and thinking nothing more other than a really well made indie game and imagining that it will become a movie and I cant believe how far fnaf has come it was once a small game and has become an entire franchise. Im very excited for this movie."
"1262","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"Reminder: this all started because of one man with a small dream. From a small indie game to a massive franchise!! Truly poetic ‚ù§"
"1263","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"I love how they changed the eyes, the more subtle yellow eyes and red pupils looks so much better. The all red was just so bright and distracting but the yellow makes them look like they‚Äôre almost sick or something, I LOVE IT."
"1264","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-07-07,"In most movies, when someone would report someone being possessed or if there is a killing robot in the streets, officers would laugh it off and ignore it, but the fact that in this movie, an officer literally informes Mike that there are kids possessing the animatronics and her telling him that they want to make Abby like the animatronics is kind of cool."
"1265","Five Nights at Freddy's",2023-06-27,"It‚Äôs so nice to see how far Cory has come from playing fnaf in 2014 to actually being in the movie for it it‚Äôs insane üëèüèæ"

"1270","Wonka",2023-07-13,"When I was a child the original Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite movie. I would watch it every day multiple times a day and make my whole family watch with me. Most of my family got tired of me asking them to rewatch it for the 100th time but my grandma never did. She always watched it with me, sung the songs, and rehearsed the lines with me. she never got tired of it. Earlier this year she passed away and I wish I could see this with her but when it comes out I will go see it in honor of her with a empty seat next to me just for her.<br><br>Edit: I didn‚Äôt mean the one with Johnny Depp I meant the original movie with Gene Wilder just forgot it was named Willy wonka and the chocolate factory instead of Charlie and the chocolate factory."
"1271","Wonka",2023-07-11,"To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling"
"1272","Wonka",2023-07-14,"I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get to see an third installment of Wonka in my lifetime. I‚Äôm 72 years old and I will be watching this film at the theaters!"
"1273","Wonka",2023-07-14,"Every character I&#39;ve seen Timoth√©e Chalamet play is usually soft-spoken and reserved ... so it&#39;s kind of odd to see him in an energetic role like this. At the end of the day, though? It looks like a cute, lighthearted, family-friendly flick that people&#39;ll take their kids to during the holidays. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it ended up doing really well..."
"1274","Wonka",2023-07-14,"Honestly it&#39;s nice to see a heartwarming movie coming to theaters for a change. I feel like the cast and crew had a lot of fun with Wonka"
"1275","Wonka",2023-07-12,"The simple fact that this is directed by the guy who did the two Paddington movies is enough to get me to watch this. Those films were absolute masterpieces of performances, storytelling and direction."
"1276","Wonka",2023-07-11,"&quot;From the Director of Paddington&quot; I&#39;m sold, those movies are cinematic masterpieces"
"1277","Wonka",2023-07-12,"A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea."
"1278","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Okay, good to know this is a film that knows it is goofy and silly, but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun. Not to mention the cast looks incredible, and the director has never actually made a bad film, so I got a good feeling about this one."
"1279","Wonka",2023-07-24,"I love how this is 100% a Christmas movie without being about actual Christmas. The outfits and whole aesthetic. Christmas was definitely the vibe they where going for!"
"1280","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Even if it&#39;s minor role, it&#39;s always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can&#39;t wait to see this one, the film captures the spirit of the source material so well ‚ù§"
"1281","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Something I never thought I wanna see: a Willy Wonka prequel!"
"1282","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Directed and written by the man who made paddington? It&#39;s gonna be a masterpiece."
"1283","Wonka",2023-07-20,"Love the ending, when he says &quot;the true wonka were the friends we made along the way&quot;"
"1284","Wonka",2023-07-25,"I loved it when he said &quot;It&#39;s Wonking Time&quot; and Wonked all over the screen, one of the movie moments of all time."
"1285","Wonka",2023-07-11,"If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then there&#39;s no stopping him.<br>You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka."
"1286","Wonka",2023-07-11,"the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has"
"1287","Wonka",2023-07-12,"I love how Timothee Chalamet is paying homage to both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder when it comes to his take on Willy Wonka. So excited to see his full version of wonka, based on what I see in this trailer, he already is amazing!!!"
"1288","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary. But I gotta admit, this looks quite good. And Timothee is very talented!"
"1289","Wonka",2023-07-11,"The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Beae, and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film, means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel. RIP Gene Wilder."
"1290","Wonka",2023-07-11,"This looks like a real festive movie. We&#39;ve not had one of those in years."
"1291","Wonka",2023-07-21,"Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over. Thank you Roald Dahl."
"1292","Wonka",2023-08-16,"On the one hand, it looks whimsical and lovely for a Christmas movie. On the other, and I might be the cheese that stands alone, I feel like Chalamet is not weird enough for the role - his lines fall flat to me. I love Chalamet so hoping the movie will change my mind. I&#39;ll watch if only for Grant as a oompa loompa, what genius casting!"
"1293","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good"
"1294","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Willy Wonka is actually selling his weird stuff and not just his chocolate bars. Respect to WB for going in a new direction rather than just the &quot;I need a replacement for my chocolate factory&quot; also I enjoyed the Harry Potter vibe from the setting, Wonka may not have been magical but his candy sure seems to be."
"1295","Wonka",2023-07-16,"I love how they harmonized (reprised) the ‚Äúin the world of pure imagination‚Äù in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=90"">1:30</a>"
"1296","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I was always wondering how a prequel to willy wonka, describing his origin, would be like. Now, after seeing this, I am fully onboard now. This looks absolutely amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see this in theaters."
"1297","Wonka",2023-07-11,"This movie looks absolutely magical, I never knew I needed a willy wonka prequel but this looks like it‚Äôs gonna be a wonderful watch. can‚Äôt wait!"
"1298","Wonka",2023-07-12,"honestly im very much surprised of how amazing this looks. it feels so magical and like such a wholesome movie, and its not a remake!! its a non canon prequel of one of the most magical and mysterious characters of lots of peoples childhoods (and its timothee chalamet, which i adore with all my heart hes so adorable)"
"1299","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Hughmpa Loompa is my new favorite thing"
"1300","Wonka",2023-07-12,"As fascinating as this movie looks, I&#39;m kinda sad that we&#39;ll likely never get a &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot; movie. I remember reading that book in school immediately after finishing &quot;the Chocolate Factory&quot; and had always wondered how it could be as a movie"
"1301","Wonka",2023-10-14,"Only thing weird is how they took this in a more magical direction. Even adult Wonka hadn&#39;t perfected Fizzy lifting drink and all of his inventions had strange side effects. This younger Wonka seems too perfect."
"1302","Wonka",2023-07-12,"So happy for you Daniel Thrasher! How cool!"
"1303","Wonka",2023-08-12,"When he says ‚Äúwith great chocolate comes great responsibility‚Äù gave me chillbumps"
"1304","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I&#39;m a fairly cynical person when it comes to reboots etc, but this actually has a really fun, sincere, festive vibe. Seems like it will be a good time"
"1305","Wonka",2023-07-13,"‚ÄúDiscover how Willy became Wonka‚Äù is my new favorite line now."
"1306","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Yes another Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory movie!! This was my favorite childhood movie.<br><br>Lots of likes!"
"1307","Wonka",2023-07-11,"didn‚Äôt really think this was gonna be anything but this has captured the Roald Dahl vibe better than anything else I‚Äôve seen since the original Chocolate Factory, plus its directed by the Paddington guy"
"1308","Wonka",2023-09-07,"I love all these 100% original and not shamelessly rehashed movies being put out these days"
"1309","Wonka",2023-07-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> Always love an &quot;epic&quot; version of a classic theme tune, even if I&#39;ve only heard it about twice in my life."
"1310","Wonka",2023-07-11,"You know its gonna be good, when just the trailer puts a smile on your face."
"1311","Wonka",2023-08-03,"I love the part where Timothee said &quot;it&#39;s wonking time.&quot; Really a movie of many generations and timely accurate depictions."
"1312","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Timothee proves himself once again to be a versatile actor that has so much to offer. <br><br>He‚Äôs not this generation‚Äôs Johnny Deep or Leo. <br><br>He‚Äôs the one and only Timothee Chalamet!"
"1313","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I cant&#39;t wait! The cast is insane! My jaw was on the floor throughout the video. Timothee has an extraordinary career going on."
"1314","Wonka",2023-07-12,"Okay, I haven&#39;t seen that many Timothee Chalamet movies, but he seems to smile a lot more here. It&#39;s good to see him expand his acting range. Looking forward to this movie."
"1315","Wonka",2023-07-11,"This shows that Timothee is really growing as an actor. I&#39;m actually proud of him."
"1316","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Honestly I love how endearing and comfortable Timothee is in the role. It&#39;s like he amplifies the &quot;feel-good&quot; and whimsical tones of the film really well. I also like how they showed us that Willy Wonka struggles, without shoving it down our throats. Can&#39;t wait for this"
"1317","Wonka",2023-07-12,"I love how whimsical it is. Very true to the feel of the original and I have faith in the Director of Paddington to create a masterpiece."
"1318","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Remember seeing the original as a little kid when it first came out in theaters. Seen it countless times since.  I begrudgingly ended up enjoying Tim Burton&#39;s version, particularly Danny Elfman&#39;s music.  This one also looks promising.  Should do well, I think."
"1319","Wonka",2023-07-13,"‚ÄúSo shines a good deed in a weary world‚Äù - Willy Wonka (1971). They‚Äôre bringing the spirit of the first film back, and I‚Äôm totally on board."
"1320","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Love the how they use ‚Äúpure imagination‚Äù in this, the inspiration is lovely"
"1321","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Timoth√©e Chalamet is a phenomenal actor. I hope they show a devastated and torn side of him to keep the audience from thinking this is only a whimsical story"
"1322","Wonka",2023-07-12,"Chalamet‚Äôs take feels a lot like Gene Wilder‚Äôs Wonka before he became jaded, bitter, and worn down. I like it."
"1323","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Man that scene where willy said &quot;It&#39;s wonking time&quot; and chocolated everyone in the room,, cinema right there."
"1324","Wonka",2023-07-13,"Charlie and the chocolate factory + Mr Bean = Perfect combo to re-live my childhood memories üòçüòçüòç"
"1325","Wonka",2023-07-12,"Wow this looks amazing! People were talking like it was going to be dark and gritty, instead it&#39;s whimsical, with dance numbers! This trailer totally changed my opinion on this movie. I can&#39;t wait to see it."
"1326","Wonka",2023-07-18,"I am genuinely so happy that they are not just rehashing the old story and are giving us something different. TC looks in amazing form as ever!"
"1327","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I loved it when Wonka said &quot;With great chocolate comes great responsibility&quot; truly the most movie moment ever made"
"1328","Wonka",2023-07-12,"This film seems too perfect to be true. Starry cast all perfect for their roles, directed and produced by big names who created critically and financially successful films in the past few decades, and a timeless story that&#39;s still held dearly by children and adults alike around the world. Hopefully this hype will be well-deserved once the film comes out!"
"1329","Wonka",2023-07-11,"The magic, the vibes, the music. It‚Äôs all so wonderful. Def won‚Äôt be skipping this one"
"1330","Wonka",2023-07-11,"The Paddington production team and Chalamet sounds like a recipe for success right here, especially for the latter as Dune, Part 2 is also guaranteed to be a success!"
"1331","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Rowan Atkinson&#39;s appearance alone is enough to let me know that this movie is gonna be great, and of course our boy Timothy will amaze us with his performance‚ú®Ô∏è"
"1332","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I love the part when he said it‚Äôs wonking time. Sent chills down my spine"
"1333","Wonka",2023-07-13,"TC is playing the character as intended, as someone who is quirky and intelligent, who is very forward but also has a huge heart.  As a prequel, I can get behind this."
"1334","Wonka",2023-07-14,"I think this actually looks rather fun and I trust the makers of Paddington implicitly to handle this with care and integrity. That being said, this does feed even more into the idea that Hollywood is absolutely bankrupt of original ideas and creativity."
"1335","Wonka",2023-07-11,"&quot;Everything good in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours.&quot; So beautiful. This movie will be magical üíñ"
"1336","Wonka",2023-07-11,"Everyone wait hold on is that from mr bean? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=101"">1:41</a>"
"1337","Wonka",2023-07-11,"My favorite scene was when Willy Wonka said &quot;May thy chocolate chip and shatter.&quot; Truly one of the Wonka moments of all time."
"1338","Wonka",2023-07-11,"It looks incredible, can&#39;t wait to see Timoth√©e in a very different role !"
"1339","Wonka",2023-07-17,"I absolutely love when the movie shows the words ‚ÄúDiscover How Willy Became Wonka‚Äù and how Wonka is this beautiful looking title, I‚Äôm already gonna love this movie"
"1340","Wonka",2023-07-11,"I still think Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka but may he rest in peace, I&#39;ll give this movie a chance"
"1341","Wonka",2023-07-12,"The opportunity to see Timmy dancing and singing already had me sold on the<br> movie, but this makes it look even more amazing than I&#39;d imagined."
"1342","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"That &quot;sorry dad&quot; from Mikey was a great touch, i love it when splinter is shown more of a father to them than just a sensei"
"1343","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"Their reaction to ‚Äúbecause he kills everyone who does‚Äù is such a teen boy reaction I love it"
"1344","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"‚ÄúYou ratted us out!‚Äù <br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use that word that way!!‚Äù <br>‚ÄúSorry, dad.‚Äù <br>I love this movie already üò≠"
"1345","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"Jackie Chan playing as Splinter is probably the best casting for this movie."
"1346","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"I actually love the idea of actually seeing them as Younger Teenagers. Usually they&#39;re obviously around like 16-19 year olds personality wise but these guys feel like they are fresh out of 6th grade."
"1347","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"Love the idea of Mikey presumably going through puberty before Donnie, it adds a lot of character seeing as Mikey is usually the baby of the group."
"1348","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"I adore the Spider-verse inspired animation esthetic, but instead of going with a comic book style, it looks more like a graffiti, street art texture and design, absolutely perfect for our turtles"
"1349","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"I love the fact that the Turtles are voiced by actual Teenagers and act like them as well it&#39;s  such a nice detail"
"1350","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"&quot;that makes me feel like he&#39;s a rat&quot; ü§£"
"1351","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-02,"Making the Turtles actual Teenagers feels obvious, yet its rarely done. Props"
"1352","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"I love how TMNT is timeless. No matter what you do with those turtles. It never gets old. it&#39;s always  exciting"
"1353","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"This movie has such a more grungy aesthetic which really complements the character designs of the turtles, the ferocious mutants, and the humans. And once again, the animation is stellar! The bright pops of color contrasting to the dark gritty background make for some great visuals. The fight scenes look well animated and the hand-drawn effects are done incredibly well. The character designs for each mutant are distorted and grotesque with slight face disfigurements that differ themselves from other iterations. Hearing more of the turtles‚Äô voices in this trailer was great. Them being actual teenagers really complements the dark gritty environment and situation they‚Äôre facing, which helps them to add comedy as they might‚Äôve never dealt with something like this before. This trailer was absolutely great and I can‚Äôt wait for more news! Thank you to the animation team, Paramount, the voice actors, and everyone involved for making this movie possible!"
"1354","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"It&#39;s crazy how we are living in somehow like a golden era for animation industry. The quality of animated movies these days are more unique and animators are trying different things to give new flavors to it. I love it!"
"1355","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"I love the fact that he doesn&#39;t even deny that he has rage, he&#39;s just saying It ain&#39;t a problem. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHvzw4Ibuho&amp;t=128"">2:08</a>"

"1357","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"As somebody who grew up with the Turtles, it&#39;s pretty awesome to see them still going strong after almost 40 years. Can&#39;t wait to see this flick."

"1360","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"The Turtles having younger-sounding voices is such a nice change of pace. It makes them more relatable for younger kids."
"1361","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"I‚Äôm loving the visual style of this movie, it really does fit the TMNT"
"1362","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"No matter what you do with these turtles, it never gets old."
"1363","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-01,"This actually looks awesome.. I love how the brothers are younger teens.. they‚Äôre always depicted as so much older and more serious.. looks like a great kids movie<br><br>Edit: I know TMNT isn‚Äôt JUST for kids.. I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôd love to go see this movie.. what I mean is that it‚Äôs directed towards kids much more than the older already established fanbase and I really like that.. at the end of the day it IS a kids movie"
"1364","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"The turtles eyes going white when they get serious was one of the coolest things in the 2012 show i&#39;m glad they brought it back"

It&#39;s a cool mix of previous takes on the Turtles, it&#39;s colorful and exciting, GORGEOUS, it has an actual teenage vibe and actors, they do feel young, naive, more childish like just into middle school- bro I&#39;m definitely watching this"
"1371","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-07-02,"The best part about this movie is that for once the turtles are played by actual teenage boys the fact that they are means that this movie is going to be even more epic"
"1372","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-03,"It&#39;s a little detail but at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHvzw4Ibuho&amp;t=64"">1:04</a> I love the fact that when Leo Blinks his mask doesn&#39;t blink with him.

"1416","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"I&#39;m absolutely digging what I&#39;m witnessing, the animation style looks so cool in motion and I really love that the Turtles are ACTUALLY teenagers (unlike how 2K3 or Bayverse TMNT depicted them), I can&#39;t wait to see this one, been a fan since the original cartoon and live action trilogy. ‚ù§"

"1418","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-05-31,"Man, this looks so bonkers. The art style is absolutely blowing my mind, it&#39;s gorgeous. It&#39;s not just copying Spider-Verse&#39;s homework, it&#39;s taking what worked and doing its own thing. And it looks phenomenal and bizarre in a way that makes me shocked a major studio let it happen. Can&#39;t wait."
"1419","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",2023-06-06,"I&#39;m loving this kind of animation!!<br>Thank you Into the Spiderverse for taking risks and  leading the way ‚ù§"

"1421","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Love the vibe of this trailer. It definitely has a darker more sinister tone than the last film."
"1422","Scream VI",2023-01-21,"I was just thinking we didn‚Äôt need another Scream, but oh my gosh. Yes, please keep bringing Scream into the new age. It‚Äôs so real and terrifying. Ghostface believes in ‚ÄúAdapt and overcome.‚Äù"
"1423","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"The ‚Äúshrine room‚Äù has outfits from past killers and victims. You can see Tatum‚Äôs outfit, Billy‚Äôs shirt, Jill‚Äôs outfit, Olivia‚Äôs shirt, etc. So the killer had access somehow to coroner‚Äôs offices or something or some sort of archive. Very creepy and interesting. And the Gale scene looks amazing! also, the scene with Sam and Tara back to back looks like they‚Äôre surrounded by ghost faces maybe? Or atleast the usual two."
"1424","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"the cast, the setting, the genre, the return, the mystery. that is why i love scream."
"1425","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Legit looks scary, if this is good then the Scream franchise won‚Äôt have a bad movie IMO"
"1426","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"First off, I love the fact the killer is acting like a killer and is not afraid to kill."
"1427","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This looks surprisingly promising. I was worried without Neve Campbell returning. I LOVE that we finally get to see Gale get a call from/actually SPEAK with Ghostface for the 1st time in the franchise!"
"1428","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Looks really good. Looks like the unknowns can possibly act. Seeing him in the store with a shotgun and several potential random victims gave it a modern gritty type of feel. This movie might actually benefit from not having Sydney in it which can allow this plot to move forward."
"1429","Scream VI",2023-01-26,"I was 17 when the OG film came out and I&#39;m still just as hyped every time! I appreciate this &quot;going big&quot;, but keeping a sense of continuity and self awareness that&#39;s the essence of the franchise."
"1430","Scream VI",2023-03-08,"After watching this movie - I came to applaud how well made this trailer it is! It did not give away much of the plot and hypes the movie up perfectly."
"1431","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"They can keep making these movies and I‚Äôm going to watch them every single time üòÇ"
"1432","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Scream is such a comforting series. All of the films have so many things to love, and so much charm. This film seems darker, and more sinister. Ghostface is grittier and angrier. I can feel the cast simply hit it out of the ballpark with this one. Really happy to see Hayden Panettiere return as Kirby. Also really happy to see Dermott Mulroney, I think he‚Äôs a great actor. This is gonna be badass!"
"1433","Scream VI",2023-01-28,"I just finished a Scream movie marathon, I honestly can&#39;t wait to watch the 6th one. This looks like they really took it to another level"
"1434","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"kevin williamson was right, this feels like a completely new ‚Äúscream‚Äù movie. the creepiness, the returning characters and ghostface looks his best yet. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23screamvi"">#ScreamVI</a>"
"1435","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"If you are like me Scream is like comfort horror. I watch for the nostalgia not the scares. The perfect mix of action, comedy, and jump scares that you kinda see coming because you know someone is gonna die you just don&#39;t know who. However, this looks different, like they are handing the torch to the new generation. Still need gale to make it through alive."
"1436","Scream VI",2023-01-22,"Nothing but chills<br><br>Also I really hope that Gale doesn‚Äôt die but it‚Äôs not looking good for her, then again she‚Äôs survived all of Ghostface‚Äôs attacks"
"1437","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I cannot wait for new chase scenes in this movie! The one with Mindy on a ladder looks good and I&#39;m kinda scared for Tara a little bit. Sam is definitely going to get the respect she deserves! People were way too harsh on her but she will prove that she deserves to be a final girl!"
"1438","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This looks like a really great refresh of this franchise and I love the darker tone and mood. I hope they‚Äôll keep it in the movie as well. That Gale scene looks promising!"
"1439","Scream VI",2023-01-22,"I believe this is a good representation of ghostface. The kills are quick, sneaky, and clever, the best part is that there‚Äôs no losing him easily. I like the confusion on the train when everyone has on the ghostface mask so they cannot tell which one it is, that was cool. I can tell in this movie ghostface isn‚Äôt going to be weak"
"1440","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This feels dark, new, fresh and basically everything we needed in a scream film."
"1441","Scream VI",2023-01-22,"5 things I already love. New Setting, Gale gets a phone call, New Ghoseface not hiding and in public attacking people, Kerby is back, Sam&#39;s smile and head tilt reminded me so much of Billy.üòçüëªüì±üíÄ"
"1442","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"It doesn&#39;t feel like &#39;Part 6&#39; it feels like you&#39;re watching this big, huge, fresh reinvention. I love it. I&#39;m gonna have a big smile on my face when I see this movie. I think it&#39;s everything and more. And going to New York is awesome. The movie feels new, it feels fresh, it feels like a new movie.&#39;&#39;"
"1443","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I honestly like the way this is going. I can&#39;t wait to see how the roles change, and more of how the Ghostface killer is different!!"
"1444","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"&quot;There&#39;s never been one quite like me Gale. I&#39;m something different.&quot;<br><br>Getting Major Stu Vibes from that Line!"
"1445","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"This scream has a whole different tone and atmosphere to it! Gritty chilling dark creepy. Ghost face normally isn‚Äôt scary but looks terrifying and ruthless in this! Can‚Äôt wait for this! and love Gail hope she survives this one!"
"1446","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"What I love about this series is that it&#39;s stupidly and weirdly good...u seem to predict the killer but it always shocks u at the end..even though the story is too classic,the series took the world by storm.<br>and this season is just on another level i guess..Jenna and all the other great actors..I can&#39;t wait to watch itüí´üî•"
"1447","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"The seven 11 sound is EVERYTHING. Melissa is looking a lot more engaged in this. Also finally some proper gale chase scenes. High hopes for this really"
"1448","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This ghost face is definitely not like the others. They feel very dark, sinister, almost non-human in a way. So hyped for this, can&#39;t wait!"
"1449","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Im so glad Kirby is back. I hope she has a big role in this film."
"1450","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"The fact that Ghostface can sneak around a major city without getting arrested is just terrifying."
"1451","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I&#39;m so nervous for Mindy, Gale, and Kirby. PLEASE don&#39;t kill them."
"1452","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"This movie looks so amazing"
"1453","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"The Shrine room looks incredible! Also I noticed There‚Äôs nine ghostface costumes up on stage to possibly represent the nine killers there have been in prior to scream VI (maybe they planned that? Maybe not?). i&#39;ve been pausing the trailer frame by frame and it looks like they have something from every scream movie, even stuff from Windsor College! Love those additions. This movie looks both nostalgic AND refreshing at the same time...hard to do in the cinema world now a days..<br><br>Also, how AWESOME is the new mask??"
"1454","Scream VI",2023-02-09,"One of the few franchises that adapt and improve with time. I&#39;m pumped to see this"
"1455","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Scream VI is worth getting excited for. The cast alone have what it takes to deliver such groundbreaking performances."
"1456","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"It only took 6 movies for Ghostface to call Gale. Should be well worth the wait!"
"1457","Scream VI",2023-01-28,"I think ghost face has the coolest costume of any slasher character‚Ä¶ üêê üíØ"
"1458","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"It actually looks like it&#39;s going to be so good. Really dark. Please let Ghostface NOT be a joke. Please."
"1459","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I LOVE that they brought Kirby back!! I thought they had just completely forgotten about that character, because I was like 80 percent sure she was still alive. That is honestly so cool.. I‚Äôm definitely excited for this.<br><br>Edit: I also hope we get a Sidney appearance, it wouldn‚Äôt be the same without her. OR maybe the killer is Sidney this time hmm? Finally mentally snapped after all these years, the reason this Ghostface seems like its going to be a lot smarter than previous ones.?? (This is a joke btw)"
"1460","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I have to admit, this isn‚Äôt quite what I expected, but in the best possible way! This feels sinister, it feels evil. Although Sidney isn‚Äôt in this movie, which is still a shame, I really think it‚Äôll deliver regardless. Looking forward to this!"
"1461","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Me and my best mate loved the scream franchise and used to watch all the movies together. The 4th one came out when we were in high school and when they made a fifth, we went to the movies together to watch, and it was one of the best memories of my life. He passed away last year. I&#39;m going to watch this one for the both of us."
"1462","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"i love the shrine that ghostface has! i love this vibe for the film! i love that sam is getting the recognition she deserves! i‚Äôm nervous for Gale!! if they kill her omg i will RAGE!"
"1463","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I love how they&#39;re really taking advantage of the new setting and new ways that Ghostface can instill death and terror. Especially if certain plot details are any indication of how Ghostface to this day remains both in universe and out of universe such a horrifying idea."
"1464","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I am super hyped and excited for Scream VI! Ghostface is one of the best horror villains of all time! The fact that anyone can be Ghostface is terrifying. Also Kirby is back!!!"
"1465","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Gale finally getting her first official 1 on 1 call with a Ghostface! OMG<br><br>Everything seems so fast and paced. Super cannot wait for this. Promising and definitely got all of us hooked that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m getting Scream 2-ish vibes with the Gale Weathers scene!"
"1466","Scream VI",2023-01-22,"This is why Scream will forever be the GOAT. Every movie is a legit production and event, with great and innovative quality. A fan since 1996 until the end!"
"1467","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"THIS. IS. HOW. YOU. MAKE. A. TRAILER!!!!<br>THIS DESERVES AN APPLAUSE AND STANDING OVATION!!!"
"1468","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This is such a minor thing, but it really warms my heart that random guy instantly began protecting the girls once he realized some green was making them uncomfortable.  Also, respect to the shop owner for pulling out the shotgun.  Normally I&#39;d say so uncivilized, but today is the exception."
"1469","Scream VI",2023-02-25,"It&#39;s sad to know that Neve Campbell is not returning for this 6th instalment. She deserved accolades and worth in salary for her role. Paramount did her dirty when it came to her payment"

"1471","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"What I really loved about this trailer is that it&#39;s embracing the full violence, horror that Ghost face has. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the sarcasm comedy of the franchise, but I&#39;m truly loving that it&#39;s getting more dark now. Plus, this Ghostface looks more violent than the others, which is very good! üî™üî™üî™"
"1472","Scream VI",2023-01-22,"SCREAM CAN NEVER GET OLD. And I&#39;m actually proud that each movie they made is GOOD and makes SENSE."
"1473","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"Been a huge fan since the first film and I don&#39;t care what anyone says, this one looks amazing. I love the really dark vibe. I love the complete re-vamp of the entire premise by having it set in New York. Can&#39;t wait to watch!"
"1474","Scream VI",2023-01-21,"Props to the sound designer for this new sequel, it totally adds to the new feel of the franchise. As an oldschool horror film buff, I&#39;m looking forward to this instalment."
"1475","Scream VI",2023-01-27,"Scream is probably the most consistent horror franchise and this looks like it&#39;s gonna be another great one"
"1476","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I love how this movie keeps having sequels after sequels but they are never boring to watch. Also, SCREAM is the best slasher horror movie ever since."
"1477","Scream VI",2023-02-19,"Finally, Ghostface BECOMES the true badass he needed to be to continue (&amp; no I don&#39;t mean he&#39;s become a supernatural being), long live Scream and all those that are terrified by Ghostface üò±üíÄ"
"1478","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Samara Weaving = Opening Kill<br><br>Sam‚Äôs head tilt‚Ä¶definitely killer vibe. Also the mask she‚Äôs holding in the trailer, I definitely feel like it‚Äôs her dad‚Äôs mask. <br><br>Tara‚Äôs face while dangling from the building‚Ä¶definitely suspicious and sinister. <br><br>The commentary of this movie definitely feels like the sensationalizing of the Scream Killings, like Dahmer is doing on Netflix, and having the victims relive their trauma. <br><br>I hope Gale doesn‚Äôt die, but with Dewey gone, and being through the ringer herself‚Ä¶this might be it for her. <br><br>Kirby NEEDS to survive, because if they brought her back to kill her‚Ä¶I will riot because what was the point?"
"1479","Scream VI",2023-01-28,"So grateful for Wes making this franchise come to life but I‚Äôm very happy with the direction Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are going with these new films. This trailer Gave me chills. I loved Scream 5, can‚Äôt wait for this one"
"1480","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This trailer is EVERYTHING!! Really rooting for Scream VI! This made my entire year! <br><br>March 10, it‚Äôs a date!"
"1481","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This franchise has NEVER let me down. Looks like they‚Äôre gonna keep that tradition going üòÅ great trailer."
"1482","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I love how this Ghostface actually acts like a killer, he feels like an actual serial killer and isn‚Äôt afraid to go and kill people. I‚Äôm happy that we finally got Kirby back, and the fact that this is taking place in a city like New York is just wild! Gale finally gets a call from Ghostface, and so much more. Im hyped for this."
"1483","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This is going to be one of those movies that everyone even people who don‚Äôt like horror will go see, because it just looks that DAMN GOOD!!!! Can‚Äôt wait"
"1484","Scream VI",2023-01-28,"Cannot wait to see it but it&#39;s difficult to see Scream without Sidney and Dewey."
"1485","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"The fun thing about this franchise is none of the movies are bad and they all are so rewatch able and this one looks like it‚Äôll keep the streak going"
"1486","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Love the vibe and the returns, but Sidney is going to be missed, she is the rock of the franchise."
"1487","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I&#39;m actually so scared for Gale this time, it looks like he got her in the trailer, and the fact that they killed Dewey in Scream 5 makes me believe that they will kill the famous trio, with Gale being killed of this time and Sidney being the only one left from them in Scream 7 maybe, and I don&#39;t really believe they&#39;d kill her off any time in the future."
"1488","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"This trailer was perfect. Didn‚Äôt give away a lot. The darker tone, NYC setting, and a more violent and brutal Ghostface is going to be a good time. Excited for Hayden Panettiere‚Äôs return and the addition of Samara Weaving. Could be one of the best in the franchise. Radio Silence knows what they‚Äôre doing ü§òüèΩ"
"1489","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"Gale! Amazing scenes like always! This film is going to be save because of her. We all are going to miss Sid, but looks like because of Courteney Cox, dark scenes, brutal ( and strong) killer, new ways to kill‚Ä¶. This is looking so good!!!Can‚Äùt imagine how good could be be this with Neve and Court together ‚ù§üò¢"
"1490","Scream VI",2023-01-19,"I love the tension in some of these scenes. The cat and mouse scene with ghostface and the shotgun in the convenience store reminds me of Gale‚Äôs scene in 2. And the scene with Mindy on the ladder reminds me of the car scene in 2. 6 is definitely gonna work it‚Äôs way up to one of my favorites in the franchise"
"1491","Scream VI",2023-01-26,"Pay attention to two things: Kirby barely appears in one or two scenes, and in none of them is seen that Ghostface is attacking her.  That is, if Kirby is absent it is because she can be the murderer. Sam then holds the Ghostface mask in her hands, and it is wrapped as in a black jacket (Kirby&#39;s clothing).  It may be that this scene be of the finals, when after the confrontation, it is discovered that Kirby was the assassin ..."
"1492","Scream VI",2023-01-20,"This movie looks so amazing, Ghostface just got transformed into a highly skilled assassin that stalks his victims and makes them feel truly uneasy, hopeless, and out-matched. Perfect for a disturbing horror movie to really make you feel on edge. Can&#39;t wait to watch it when it comes out! ‚ù§"

"1495","The Flash",2023-02-13,"It‚Äôs honestly cool to see a much older Batman and the fact they got Michael Keaton to return is awesome"

"1573","M3GAN",2022-10-12,"Seeing Megan dance can cross the barrier of being unsettling, creepy and hilarious. Even If It might not be a great film, they nailed the doll&#39;s visual concept. The team understood the assignment on the uncanny valley."
"1574","M3GAN",2022-10-15,"those dance moves ??? she&#39;s literally slaying while slaying people"
"1575","M3GAN",2022-10-17,"I just love how it goes from heartwarming to completely violent and hilarious<br>I watched it at least 20 times already. The dance slays"

"1592","M3GAN",2022-10-15,"Why do I find this so sweet?! Having someone to protect you from any kind harm is... a really huge thing. Megan over did it, but she did it. She understood her assignment properly and like a good robot completed it. It&#39;s not her fault that many human things are not just black and white like her commands suggest."

"1597","M3GAN",2022-10-11,"i like the idea that she&#39;s a protector, it makes it almost eerily comforting...as if we&#39;re on her side"
"1598","M3GAN",2022-10-12,"The concept of making the doll a protector who takes her role too far, but is still so child-like that she enjoys it and wants to dance gives it an eerie element of fun. The doll‚Äôs ability to articulate herself at an adult level is startling all on its own, and her running on all fours üò≥ with, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have a friend,‚Äù is perfect! I‚Äôm here for how lifelike the doll looks, talks and moves. Her hair is better laid than some real people outchea. üëÄüíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ü§£ Go ‚Äòhead M3GAN!"

"1601","M3GAN",2022-10-27,"This is really something. Megan‚Äôs eyes, her movements, and her voice is what makes her creepy. The dancing is funny and random at the same time. The music is great. I love when artists‚Äô music is used as horror music for trailers or even as a eerie song choice for a scene in a film.<br><br>Also, this film is in my Birthday Month. This will be a treat for me to see when it comes out in theaters."

So far, it‚Äôs impressive how the actress portraying Megan in this embodies the character so well. Hopefully she gets to be further recognized in the realm of horror movies."

"1642","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-12-02,"For the real DnD experience, the movie should stop halfway through the adventure. Then everyone in the cinema has to schedule a time when they can finish the film."
"1643","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-29,"Just got back from the theater. Was expecting nothing special and was surprised to find an actually solid and enjoyable movie. Funny and emotional at times. Great stuff!"
"1644","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-24,"One of the party members better be unexplainably absent for at least a week and then magically re-appear for the real DnD experience"
"1645","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-04,"1. The protagonists &quot;unleash the greatest evil.&quot;<br>2. There is an owlbear.<br>3. There is a mimic disguised as a treasure chest.<br>4. The Bard is being mocked for being useless.<br>This movie is certainly made by true experienced D&amp;D geeks."
"1646","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-26,"Chris&#39; little kick step while lute strumming at the end is perfection."
"1647","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"This is genuinely good D&amp;D energy.<br>The DM is trying his hardest to tell a serious story but the players are having none of that."
"1648","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"This looks like the director dmed a campaign for the main cast and turned it into a script, which is the vibe I want from. A dnd movie"
"1649","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-01,"&quot;So you make plans that fail.&quot;  Lol.  Every D&amp;D party ever.  Some plans succeed.  But almost always a ton of chaos in the process."
"1650","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"This looks WAYYY better than I was expecting. Looks pretty fun tbh"
"1651","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"Owlbear, Displacer Beast and Mimic look awesome. Seems like they are capturing a bit of the spirit of party dynamics and the chaos of the dice. I&#39;m hopeful."
"1652","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-25,"if you guys have these thieves struggle to open a simple door with a lock or if the rogue doesn&#39;t have some traumatic backstory about being raised by the &quot;streets&quot; and get&#39;s made fun of for being edgy I will tell all my mates that this is the best action/fantasy movie ever made"
"1653","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-30,"Watched it last night at the early release, was definitely a fun night! The movie doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, that‚Äôs the best part"
"1654","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"This actually looks like it‚Äôll be genuinely fun. The cast looks super charismatic and it really gives off the group of idiots that stumble into some world threatening adventure, but they show how manage to BS their way through it somehow. Exactly like a DnD campaign usually goes"
"1655","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-25,"They should release like character sheets for the party. That would be swell."
"1656","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Avoiding a Displacer Beast by hiding in a Gelatinous Cube? That&#39;s the DND shenanigans I&#39;m here for!"
"1657","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-10,"as a Bard player, &quot;&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known... but we are going to fix it&quot;   gets me going haha"
"1658","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I‚Äôm impressed they went with a black dragon. A Red‚Äôs fire breath is so iconic that you naturally would expect it to be the lead but no we get a black flying over just puking acid all over an army well played trailer well played"
"1659","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-25,"Saw this last night. It&#39;s a lot of fun. The characters and their individual quirks are really strong. It&#39;s a cinema film for sure. Quite funny in parts too. Imma see it again."
"1660","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-25,"They should do a post-credit scene where the cast from the original D&amp;D movie is siting around a table playing D&amp;D, with Jeremy Irons as the DM, and someone says &quot;this story was a lot better than the first one we did&quot;.  Would be hilarious!"
"1661","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"i love how to someone who hasn&#39;t played d&amp;d, this looks like the chosen heroes going on an epic and dangerous world ending quest. and it is, no doubt. however for d&amp;d that&#39;s just your average sunday. there&#39;s five other adventuring parties on other continents doing this exact same thing right now. perfect"
"1662","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"Having Chris Pine be the bard is legitimately great casting."
"1663","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-12-28,"For the real D&amp;D experience, the druid says &quot;Can I turn into an Owlbear, PLEASE!?!?&quot; and the dm goes &quot;Oh, alright, fine.&quot;"
"1664","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-25,"They had me at Chris Pine as a <b>*BARD*</b> and then they had me smiling at the correct damage type coming from the correct dragon color."
"1665","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"This looks like something straight out of a bunch of friends sitting around playing DnD with its story and I am aaaaaaalllllllllll for it.<br><br>Its the only way to make a DnD film, and I&#39;m glad they decided on this route instead of something super serious."
"1666","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-10-17,"&quot;So you make plans that fail&quot;<br>Every session summed up in one line."
"1667","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-06,"The conversation between the bard and the druid is ripped straight from a D&amp;D session, and has convinced me to see this movie"
"1668","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-23,"This movie actually exceeded my expectations. It&#39;s really fun"
"1669","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I&#39;ve always felt that the best way to make a D&amp;D movie would be to have the main cast play through a campaign, and then write the film from that. This definitely feels like that&#39;s what they did!"
"1670","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I REALLY want this to be epic, because then that opens the door to a huge source of film material.<br>Dragonlance, Faerun, Eberron... so many places full of wonderful stories"
"1671","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I&#39;m ECSTATIC at the fact that it&#39;s not a classic band of heroes who are all righteous and perfect. It&#39;s a band-of-misfits adventure to fix their mistakes and save the world and that&#39;s EXACTLY what d&amp;d is. Thank you."
"1672","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"&quot;we didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil ever known, but we are gonna fix it&quot; is like every dnd game ever"
"1673","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Chris Pine as a Bard is not something I knew I needed, but I welcome it with open arms"
"1674","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-23,"This was exactly the tone I was hoping this movie would go for.  Don&#39;t try to be the next Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, just give us a rocking fun adventure."
"1675","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2023-03-27,"Loved the movie , the landscapes , the action , the comedy and the characters , really really great"
"1676","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-23,"I came here expecting this to be an utter let down after playing/dming for 30+ years and never seeing D&amp;D treated with the respect it deserves. Taking the Guardians of the Galaxy, light hearted, fun route was genius; even though I prefer more of the Ravenloft/Dark Fantasy/Grimdark vibe. Chris Pine as a bard and not a fighter/warrior class makes me happy. Now hoping the trailer isn‚Äôt the whole movie and there is much more to come. Wishing them nothing but success in hope we get more than one film honoring D&amp;D."

"1678","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"Never expected a Led Zeppelin fueled D&amp;D trailer, but I‚Äôm here for it."
"1679","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"This trailer is FULL of D&amp;D spells, creatures, and locations straight out of the books.<br>It is full of Fan service. üòç<br>This is how Fan IPs should be made."
"1680","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"While I was hoping for a dark and gritty DnD movie, this campy and lighthearted take on things looks really fun. Kind of the drunken night of gaming with friends and rolling dice kind of movie. I can dig that."
"1681","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known, but we&#39;re going to fix it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well how do we pull that off?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh...&quot;<br><br>If every DnD campaign I&#39;ve ever been in counts as canon, then this is the most canonically accurate DnD movie I&#39;ve ever seen."
"1682","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-08,"This actually looks fun, let&#39;s hope there&#39;s a scene where one of the main characters randomly murders a villager without reason and it&#39;s never tied into the plot whatsoever."
"1683","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"As someone who played a bard that was the leader of a group of thieves during a 3 year campaign, I heartily approve."
"1684","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-12-09,"I hope someone says &quot;that&#39;s like a 1 in 20 chance of happening&quot; when something lucky happens. That&#39;ll be fucking awesome"
"1685","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-23,"This might not suck!  I think the light-hearted and humorous approach is definitely the way to go.  Has a bit of a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe to it, which is great."
"1686","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I was mildly interested in a D&amp;D Movie.<br><br>I am now VERY excited. This trailer is great. Good choice of character classes, love the monsters I recognise from the monster manuals I read as a kid, making it a heist sounds AWESOME and very appropriate. The tone seems appropriate too. Can&#39;t wait."
"1687","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Not gonna lie, seeing a Mimic made me shriek out in joy. Owlbear looks badass af. Also, this trailer has more to do with D&amp;D than the entire first movie from 2000."
"1688","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-23,"You know what stands out to me the most? The fact that I immediately spotted 5 monsters in this trailer that are relatively unique to D&amp;D, rather than just generic fantasy/mythology creatures. You&#39;ve got the owlbear (obviously), mimic, displacer beast, gelatinous cube, and a dragon with a non-fire breath weapon. (Black dragon with an acid line breath attack?)<br><br>Also, the shield effect that looks like what Eric the Cavalier used to do in the old D&amp;D cartoon.<br><br>And lots of other stuff that may or may not be unique to D&amp;D, or just come from generic fantasy. Speaking of which, is satyr a player race in D&amp;D these days?"
"1689","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Okay, this does look your typical D&amp;D adventure and.... that means they did their homework, I guess! Y&#39;know what? I&#39;m down for it!"
"1690","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I love how instead of trying to make a compelling drama about a game they made a fun movie with the established lore of the game. I also like the guardians of the galaxy vibe to it all. Looks great.<br><br>Edit: Thanks for the likes :)"
"1691","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-02,"When the trailer highlights Black dragons with acid breath, mimic&#39;s,  druid proper shapeshifting into owlbears, gelatinous cube, displacer beasts, Magic that is clearly known and recognizable spells, this,  this is gooooood."
"1692","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"WOW! It looks like they really did their research, using authentic source material instead of just generic fantasy creatures.<br>Black, white and red dragons, mimic, owlbear, displacer beast, a Red Wizard of Thay (as a Lich). Probably more that I‚Äôm missing. Can‚Äôt wait to see this!"
"1693","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"100% down for this! The CGI looks great, story seems simple and fun and can tell Chris Pine was having fun with the role."
"1694","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I have personally been at fault for the summoning of 2 demon lords over the course of a single campaign. At this point I should get ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known‚Äù on a t shirt"
"1695","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"it may be the accurate monster design, the party wanting to go over the plan in a tavern or simply the campaign accurate looking story, this movie looks phenomenal and as a D&amp;D fan I am so excited."
"1696","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"Very impressed - not only be the vibe I am getting from this trailer, but by the fact that they managed to pull me in without spoiling any of the plot. That&#39;s a bit of a lost art these days. Very much looking forward to this!"
"1697","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"This actually looks cool. Chris Pine is a cool guy."
"1698","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I can&#39;t help but be giddy when seeing all the creatures looking so real. It warms the old D&amp;D heart so very much."
"1699","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-23,"It‚Äôs awesome to see a good representation of a real D&amp;D campaign out there. People like my gf can‚Äôt quite grasp why d&amp;d is so fun and this movie literally screams out why it is so fun. In our heads it‚Äôs a movie and this is just awesome!!!"
"1700","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I&#39;m getting so many Guardians of the Galaxy vibes here, which is a great thing. The cast is outstanding, the monsters all look fantastic, and the tone that they&#39;re going for here is more of a silly adventure rather than a serious quest was definitely the right call. Looking forward to watching this nostalgic creation."
"1701","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"The ending with Pine strumming the lute was worth watching the whole trailer"
"1702","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I honestly don&#39;t know what to expect from most movies these days, This looks a lot better than I had hoped for. What ever they were going for I just wanted it done well, this looks like it has been done pretty well."
"1703","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"So rather than adapting a story in D&amp;D, they‚Äôre basically adapting how a weekly game night of playing D&amp;D with your friends can go. <br><br>I‚Äôm down for that."
"1704","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-29,"Actually looks like a real D&amp;D movie first time I&#39;ve been hype in a while for a trailer"
"1705","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-24,"Chris Pine and Michelle Rodrigez is not a duo I thought I needed, but it makes so much sense! You can tell even from this trailer how good their dynamic is. Can&#39;t wait to see this film!"
"1706","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-24,"&quot;He also plays the lute.&quot;<br>Oh okay wait so the bard is the leader? Oh, okay, I think I understand what kind of party this is. This will be loads and loads of fun. I can&#39;t wait."
"1707","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiMinixSXII&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> I gotta say, jumping into a gelatinous cube in order to avoid getting murdered by a displacer beast is kinda genius.<br>Like yes, a gelatinous cube will still kill ya, but at least you bought yourself some time.<br>200 IQ plays right there."
"1708","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Since so many people keep on commenting the same thing:<br><br>Circle of the Moon Druids can become Owl Bears. With DM approval and it&#39;s quite commonly allowed. The reason it isn&#39;t is because it&#39;s classified as a Monstrosity. Where Druid&#39;s wildshape into beasts. The reason for the Monstrosity is because the Owl Bear was originally labeled as a creation from a mad wizard.   Yet cannon changed it as a natural creature. However, the label wasn&#39;t changed. Depending on your DM you either use the older origins or the one more accepted in modern canon. So Yes a druid can wildshape into an owlbear. <br><br> &quot;However, the oldest elves recalled that owlbears had been around for many millennia and a few fey claimed owlbears had always been found in the Feywild.[1] In fact, owlbears were brought into being by one of the creator races,[11] most likely the aearee&quot;. Their stat bloc is also very close to a strong Cave Bear with similarly low intelligence. <br><br>So the reason the Owl Bear isn&#39;t allowed is due to the lore that it was created by a wizard. Yet recent lore suggests that was a myth and not the case."
"1709","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"This literally looks and feels just like a D&amp;D game"
"1710","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"This...<br><br>This actually looks like D&amp;D<br><br>My hope are slim, but this trailer does give me hope üòÑ"
"1711","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"This trailer makes me realize the crazy franchise potential DnD could have. It‚Äôs kinda like Marvel, there‚Äôs a whole slough of existing characters, spells, creatures, plotlines and more to draw inspiration from. Excited for this!"
"1712","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"I love the tone that they&#39;re going for!!! So much fun!!! Not taking themselves too seriously"
"1713","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-08-23,"It always great when you stumble across a movie you didn&#39;t know you were waiting your whole life for."
"1714","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-26,"We might FINALLY have a good DnD movie!<br>This actually looks and feels like the game experience! <br>The fact that we have a bard actually playing the face of the group instead of a backup joke character is just the cherry on top.<br>I WILL be seeing this on the big screen. üëç"
"1715","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"I was expecting WAY worse. This looks pretty dope honestly."
"1716","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-21,"Ok‚Ä¶.this looks a lot better than what I was expecting‚Ä¶.hopefully the DND movie does pretty well. Been a fan of dungeons  &amp; dragons since childhood so I think this could be fun to watch."
"1717","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"It would be really cool if they published something like a character sheet for each of the main characters since they&#39;re DND characters. That would be an awesome promotional move and also just really fun if you want to play one of the characters from the movie in your own game."
"1718","Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves",2022-07-22,"There&#39;s a dragon, there&#39;s a bard. As a DM, it already makes me nervous."
"1719","The Equalizer 3",2023-08-02,"What I always loved about these films is how he gives the evil people the chance to do the right thing and they never listen so they suffer the consequences."
"1720","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"The way Denzel can go from the charming smile, a signature in his work, putting the audience at ease, then the intensity he shows in his expressions during action scenes, it is that sort of nuance in his acting that always makes his work and art so compelling. Setting the audience up for growth in the characters he is portraying, but leaving that an unpredictable journey to discover throughout the film."
"1721","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-25,"I&#39;m beyond grateful to see him back"
"1722","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"Even at 68, Denzel Washington make me believe he&#39;s actually doing all that stuff, such an amazing actor such a treat to watch."
"1723","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"This is a must watch. Looking at Denzel and Dakota Fanning acting together almost 20 years after Man on Fire. I‚Äôm thrilled."

"1726","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-28,"Oh come on, this is one of those series that doesn&#39;t have to end. Denzel finding bad guys to punish will never get old."
"1727","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-25,"One of the greatest icons global cinema has ever produced. Denzel Washington is not an actor, he&#39;s a genre in himself"
"1728","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ikl8vy4zs&amp;t=103"">01:43</a> This is such an Equalizer moment. The underestimation and Denzel casually explaining the harm hes about to do yo you. Love it!"
"1729","The Equalizer 3",2023-07-23,"Denzel‚Äôs acting skills, his style of acting and expressions are all purely made for the art of cinema"
"1730","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"Denzel is unparalleled in this role. Almost every movie he‚Äôs done his acting skills have been on another level. Eagerly waiting for this."
"1731","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"My Dad would have become 68 this year just like Denzel Washington but he passed away just earlier this year. He was part of the German GSG9 and later on worked for the BND. We enjoyed watching the Equalizer movies, him explaining details and analysing the Movies with me will forever be a pleasant memory. I will keep watching in his legacy."
"1732","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"Seeing Denzel, Washington smile is enough to bring a smile to anyone‚Äôs face. He is such a humble guy, and the world needs more people like him."
"1733","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve done things in my life, Nikolai. Things I‚Äôm not proud of. I swore to someone I loved very much I wouldn‚Äôt go back to being that person. But for you, I‚Äôm gonna make an exception.‚Äù<br><br>Probably my favorite quote from this franchise"
"1734","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-28,"Denzel Washington is Robert McCall as Keanu Reaves is John Wick, 2 great actors that bring characters to life. Pure art."
"1735","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"Denzel never misses. One of the greatest actors of our time and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still working. Sometimes you just need a kickass good over evil movie and he makes the best."

"1753","The Equalizer 3",2023-05-01,"The Equaliser movies have been some of the best ever written and produced for the big screen. Hats off to all involved. The only disappointment is this is the last one for Denzel. <br>He has brought composure to each one of these films and realism. I can watch them over and over and never get tired of them. I hope he reads the comments on here and reconsiders his decision. Whilst I understand these movies were only ever meant to be a trilogy, they are in a league of their own. Theres always room for one or two more, just to keep the fan base happy."

"1759","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"It‚Äôs hard to compete with John Wick when it comes to action movies but this is one of the few unfinished series that can. Denzel always delivers great work."
"1760","The Equalizer 3",2023-05-01,"Denzel&#39;s acting is a true marvel to behold. He effortlessly transitions from his charming smile, which instantly puts the audience at ease, to intense and powerful expressions during action scenes. It&#39;s the subtleties in his performances that make his work so captivating, as he sets the stage for character development while keeping the journey unpredictable for viewers to discover throughout the film. It&#39;s this kind of nuance that truly sets Denzel apart as an artist üëç"
"1761","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-25,"I can‚Äôt describe what it means to me to see my favorite actor of all time in my own country for the last chapter of the equalizer. He might not be on the walk of fame in Hollywood but he is undoubtedly the most gifted actors of all. Full stop."

"1769","The Equalizer 3",2023-07-23,"It makes my heart happy to see Dakota and Denzel back on screen together again! I decided to watch Man on Fire again today after a long time of having not watched it, and I forgot how good they were together on screen! Dakota was so good even back then. Kind of odd that she‚Äôs only shown here briefly. I hope her role is larger."

"1772","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"This is literally once in a life time right here for Denzel to do a 3rd one. This is going to be so good. He has never ever in his career did 3 installments of the same character for a series. Don&#39;t miss it."

"1775","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-29,"I love Denzel.  And no, he doesn&#39;t look like a killer.  He looks like a man who wants to be left alone: the most dangerous kind of man in the world."
"1776","The Equalizer 3",2023-05-23,"That crossover with Dakota and Denzel was just like a sweet walk down memo lane, literally gave me feels on Man on Fire. You know if you know. What ab excellente touch. Really want to know her character in the movie"
"1777","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"The Equalizer movies provide such a sweet fantasy of there actually being justice in the world.  Plus the movies are just well done."
"1778","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"That mannerism &amp; the personality of Denzel Washington is Unmatched. Truly he&#39;s built for this role üëå."
"1779","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-27,"Part 2 was so good. The dynamic with his neighbor on painting the mural. The almost non existent music score in the movie,lent to the seriousness of it."
"1780","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-29,"Denzel is such a poised and classy man. He just has this foreboding presence about him in his movies. I‚Äôm beyond excited for this"
"1781","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-25,"Holy Shenanigans! I never thought we&#39;d get a third one but we are getting one. This looks incredible. The backdrop is beautiful, the action looks bats*** crazy and Denzel is as lethal as ever, if not more so because he has a new family to protect. Never mess with Robert McCall. It&#39;s so cool to see Dakota Fanning, all grown up, once again with Denzel Washington. I can&#39;t wait!!!"
"1782","The Equalizer 3",2023-07-28,"I can‚Äôt believe this is Denzel‚Äôs only movie franchise. He never made a part 2 of anything but this franchise. Remarkable Actor. üëèüëèüëèüëè"
"1783","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"I love these movies. The scene from the first one in the diner where he knows the guy isn‚Äôt an electrician and takes out the lights. Chills ü•∂"
"1784","The Equalizer 3",2023-08-07,"What I loved about these films is how he shows that evilness might look powerful on the outside, but they are actually weak in the core."
"1785","The Equalizer 3",2023-08-07,"I love how there&#39;s at least one scene in each movie where he details the exact nature of the punishment he&#39;s about to inflict in medical detail. Chilling!"
"1786","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"Denzel is one of the greatest actors ever. And his action roles ain‚Äôt no joke."
"1787","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-25,"That 9 second scene at the end was insane, might be the best Equalizer out of the 3 üî•"
"1788","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"WOAH!!! 20 years later, Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington full circle after Man on Fire is nuts."
"1789","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"I&#39;d like to thank  Antoine Fuqua , Denzel Washington and all the cast for being here in Italy to give us this action packed sequel. Just a dream to take on the mafia, but a good dream to live for us honest people. Thanks for cast Remo Girone too, I don&#39;t know if he means something to you, but for us is just so amazing see him on the big screen. Thank you."
"1790","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"See that&#39;s the thing, he doesn&#39;t actually look like a killer, makes it even more terrifying. Good to have Denzel back in this role for one final time, just like the John Wick series, the Equalizer is flawless in my opinion."
"1791","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-26,"So glad to see Denzel back.  What a great actor.  A non-Hollywood clown.  He is everything what Hollywood used to be.  So glad he is doing well!"
"1792","The Equalizer 3",2023-04-28,"THIS is how you bring an older show/story back to life!  Denzel is amazing, and the writing has been superb on the first two.  One of the few modern franchises to be excited about."

The first Nun movie was kinda disappointing but I hope this makes up for it. This scene <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-oyCwaArU&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> is a cool horror take and at the same time pays homage to Conjuring 2. &quot;It&#39;s okay to be scared, I&#39;m scared too&quot; really brings depth to the movie."

"1858","The Nun II",2023-07-09,"I love the part where The Nun screams out &quot;Where&#39;s the Lamb sauce!&quot; Truly one of the most Nuniest quotes of all time."
"1859","The Nun II",2023-08-20,"A lot of things are frightening, what‚Äôs makes such characters compelling to me is that they ask themselves ‚Äúam I too afraid to face such evil? or is my will to live stronger.‚Äù The fact that they fight despite such horror is what makes them, or any person, fictional or real, great."

Easily the best parts of the first were when Carol was just hanging out with Fury, Talos, Maria and Monica. Sticking her with Monica and Kamala for the whole thing seems like it&#39;ll be a slam dunk. Plus DeCosta really seems to know what she&#39;s doing in this, easily the biggest advantage this has over the original"

Also, people still don&#39;t seem to understand that Carol was severely brainwashed in her first movie to be an emotionless killing machine. The Kree literally gave her a full blood transfusion just to convince her she was a Kree warrior. In this movie she has reconnected with her human side."

"2130","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom",2023-12-20,"I have no idea why people hate Amber so much. I watched this movie today and the movie was good and she was good there too. Isn&#39;t an actress job to act well? Why do people care so much of her personal life? She didn&#39;t commit any crime you know."
"2131","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom",2023-10-11,"Just curious if people will boycott this because of Amber Heard ü§£üòÇ"

"2139","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Massive respect to DC for promoting the comics at the end - that‚Äôs gonna be great for the people who worked on those!"
"2140","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"The way they captured how terrifying his first transformation and assimilation into the suit was amazing and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise.<br><br>Edit: How do I mute the notifications for this comment or will it do it by itself"
"2141","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I like how his whole family watches him transform into Blue Beetle. It&#39;s actually one of the few moments you see superheroes and their families get involved. You don&#39;t see that a lot."
"2142","Blue Beetle",2023-04-07,"First DC movie in years where I am excited that his costume/armour looks accurate and realistic! Blue Beetle is a great character with a great back story that ties into a major plotline. I hope they do it as much justice as was done in Young Justice"
"2143","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Big belly burger. That suit. That transition. Just everything!!! Whoever did props and costume for this deserves a raise"
"2144","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Seeing them pay homage and reference to the history of the character, the accuracy of the suit, the CGI looks good and the fact that this looks like a good, fun, action-packed wholesome time - gives me hope."
"2145","Blue Beetle",2023-04-06,"I‚Äôm hoping this is DC‚Äôs beginning to branching out their superhero catalog in the movies. Blue Beetle has tons of potential"
"2146","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Xolo is such a likable dude that even if the movie isn&#39;t anything groundbreaking, audiences will love him and wanna see more."
"2147","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Blue Beetle is the perfect example of a legacy character done right not afraid to update the lore while respecting what came before I will forever love this character and I love the Dan Garrett and Kord shutouts at the end there!"
"2148","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I remember meeting Xolo back at a Comicon event in Knoxville, TN years ago - around the time where Cobra Kai was still pretty new and got to talk to him for a bit at his booth next to Zabka&#39;s. Such a nice down to earth kid and to see him in a major motion picture like this now makes my heart happy. Dude deserves the world with how nice and hard-working he is. Can&#39;t wait to see this!"
"2149","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Never have I been so excited to see a DC live action film since Man of Steel. I first saw Blue Beetle during Young Justice, and I fell in love with the character ever since. Hopefully the movie does him justice."
"2150","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"Xolo was amazing in Cobra Kai. Seeing him in a DC movie as Blue Beetle is a match made in heaven."
"2151","Blue Beetle",2023-04-08,"The armor looks way comic accurate than I thought it would be. <br>Massive respect for that"
"2152","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"The family knowing from the beginning that he&#39;s a superhero, and being fully supportive and helping him, after a near horror experience of watching him transform for the first time is a breath of fresh air and wholesome! Loved it üíô"
"2153","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I love that in this adaptation, the family knows about Jaime&#39;s secret and is fully supportive of him to the point that they help him on the field. So good."
"2154","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"I didn&#39;t expect to see Blue Beetle would get a movie, he&#39;s one of my favorite DC characters. Now I can finally see him in live action"
"2155","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"They did a great job showing how scary it was when he first transformed and became part of the suit, and I don&#39;t think anyone can argue with that."
"2156","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"No reason DC can‚Äôt make a static shock movie now, this looks great."
"2157","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"They got me with that intro. Thought they were going to make Jaime a crypto bro or something. Love that his family knows he&#39;s Blue Beetle from the beginning again, really wasn&#39;t a fan of when they changed that in the comics. His family being a part of his superhero life was one of the best parts of his original series."
"2158","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"It&#39;s great that they&#39;re not just translating the awesome character Jaime is from the comics; but at the end of the trailer, they showed the suits of previous Blue Beetles. Dan Gerrat and Tedd Kord.<br>Glad they&#39;re paying tribute to the OG&#39;s."
"2159","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"All the kids are going to love Blue Beetle"
"2160","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Finally we&#39;re getting a legacy character like Jaime Reyes done justice on the big screen, the organic nanotech suit up was so fascinating to watch, and in the adaptation his family knows and supports his superhero life!"
"2161","Blue Beetle",2023-04-08,"This is the first DC movie I&#39;ve been excited for in a while. Xolo is such a great fit for Blue Beetle, I&#39;m so excited to see where he takes this character and where this team takes this story."
"2162","Blue Beetle",2023-04-10,"I love how comic accurate the armor is. Kudos to DC"
"2163","Blue Beetle",2023-05-12,"I love how Reyes‚Äôs family is along side him even trying their can to help him, unlike other hero‚Äôs hiding their identity"
"2164","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"They made the suit look really good. This looks like the love child between Max Steel and Venom"
"2165","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"There&#39;s something so magic about seeing a beloved character come to life for the first time.  I got teary.  I love this character to death."
"2166","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"This costume looks incredible.  It&#39;s the first time in a long time where I don&#39;t see an actor in a suit pretending to be a superhero, I actually see the superhero.  Great job making the consume not just accurate but immersive!"
"2167","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I love that they‚Äôre including previous Blue Beetles here, seeing Ted‚Äôs costume gives me hope for a Booster Gold appearance too"
"2168","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"The fact that one of my childhood super heros, who isn&#39;t a big-name hero, is getting their own movie is getting me pumped up"
"2169","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"The most realistic suit up scene so far in all marvel/dc movies. It&#39;s like an organic nanotech, which came from inside his body, hence burning/tearing off his clothing instead of just covering it up"
"2170","Blue Beetle",2023-04-07,"DC&#39;s improving every day and I&#39;m loving Blue Beetle. This casting for the character is perfect, honestly."
"2171","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I haven&#39;t read the comics but I am a fan of Blue Beetle in the Young Justice animated series and this brought tears to my eyes. Especially Xolo as Jaime Reyes, I&#39;m hype. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
"2172","Blue Beetle",2023-04-20,"This honestly looks like one of the best realizations of a DC character in forever. Xolo is perfecting casting!"
"2173","Blue Beetle",2023-04-05,"Finally a DC project I‚Äôm actually excited for. Loved Blue Beetle in Young Justice, super excited he‚Äôs getting his own movie"
"2174","Blue Beetle",2023-04-06,"Loved that he pulled out a Buster Sword at the end, haha! Xolo&#39;s the perfect choice as the Blue Beetle!"
"2175","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I love how Jaime isn&#39;t trying to hide his identity as Blue Beetle and everyone knew about him being Blue Beetle from the start. This is a great change from the typical teen superhero movies where the main character would hide his identity as a superhero from his close ones."
"2176","Blue Beetle",2023-04-06,"I liked the part when the family wins the race against the badguys in their beetleminivan and them Dom shows up and congratulates them on understanding the importance of family."
"2177","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Xolo is a great actor. Glad to see him getting these bigger roles now"
"2178","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"This looks amazing. Just love the fact that this exists, Jaime Reyes&#39; Blue Beetle is such a cool character and deserves a movie."
"2179","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"This actually looks like a very wholesome family-centered movie. I can&#39;t wait to see how the protagonist gets closer with his family!"
"2180","Blue Beetle",2023-04-14,"I found it amusing that Blue Beetles&#39; initial transition resembled a scene from a horror film. I also enjoyed how, later in the video, Blue Beetle&#39;s family helps him battle crime even though they are aware of his true identity. Nowadays, you hardly ever see that in superheroes. Hope Blue Beetles makes history from any other modern DC movies."
"2181","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Now this actually looks like alot of fun hopefully unlike Shazam 2 people will give this Movie a chance"
"2182","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Every moment I see Blue Beetle in this he looks absolutely amazing and the casting for Jaime is perfect"
"2183","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"Never thought xolo would get this big of a role props to him üëèüèæ"
"2184","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"This looks AWESOME. The scarab burning off his clothes looked so realistic and cool. I am STOKED for this."
"2185","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I absolutely love the costume design. This looks really good. I&#39;m excited to see more. Also, awesome shout out to FF-7 with the Buster Sword!"
"2186","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"Words can‚Äôt describe how proud I am of Xolo from Cobra Kai to getting his dream role as Blue Beetle, super excited and pumped for this movie!! üíôüî•‚ú®"
"2187","Blue Beetle",2023-04-15,"As a huge Jaime Reyes fan I am so happy that DC is finally making a movie about him! I‚Äôve always thought he was way underrated and seeing him getting the attention he actually deserved makes me so excited to see the movie! Can‚Äôt wait!!!"
"2188","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3_72Gb-bI&amp;t=137"">2:17</a> He can create anything so he creates the buster sword üòÇ love it"
"2189","Blue Beetle",2023-04-07,"Dudes a great actor and I&#39;m totally proud of how far he&#39;s come. Much deserved . They couldn&#39;t have made this movie without him . It&#39;s gonna be great."
"2190","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Love Blue Beetle from Young Justice. I think the suit is iconic, I wished the voice of the scarab was like YJ but I can&#39;t wait to see what the team brings to the film."
"2191","Blue Beetle",2023-04-12,"Who else remembers the animated Batman series with Blue Beetle ? This made me remember my nostalgic childhood, so many good cartoons and series."
"2192","Blue Beetle",2023-04-27,"its just rare to see a super hero movie that your family knows your true identity and supports you doing it. I just love this kind of concept‚ô•Ô∏è"
"2193","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"The fact that the suit has practical effects makes this 10 times better. I‚Äôm in."
"2194","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"As a Young Justice fan, which Blue Beetle played a big part of in season 2, I can honestly say this looks absolutely FIRE! The suit and effects are perfect. And great song choice in ‚ÄúI Just Wanna Rock‚Äù for the trailer. Hopefully this is a hit for DC. üî•"
"2195","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"The opening shot itself sold me. The chemistry between these two siblings, the whole family dynamics is gonna be fantastic, in addition to Jaime/suit dynamic and effortlessly smooth nanotech. And, Xolo looks the part."
"2196","Blue Beetle",2023-04-10,"Blue Beetle is such an underappreciated comic character and is honestly the hero DC needs to save their cinematic universe from its decline. DC needs a relatable superhero to the youth and Robin just doesn&#39;t cut it. I really hope they nail Blue Beetle so people can better ease into the movies without it feeling awkward like they&#39;re supposed to know all these characters."
"2197","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"The whole time I was watching this trailer, I just kept quietly saying, &quot;Please don&#39;t be awful, please don&#39;t be awful, please don&#39;t be awful.&quot; Surprisingly enough, it looks badass! Xolo Maridue√±a is an incredible actor, playing an incredibly underrated superhero. Kid has got some amazing talent, and I can&#39;t wait for this movie. Also love that they show how terrifying the Scarab Armour attaching to a host is, and all of his family members&#39; reactions are spot on!"
"2198","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"I love how Jaime created a giant sword, gives off berserk and power rangers and final fantasy vibes. I‚Äôm buying tickets for opening night"
"2199","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I love that in this adaptation, the family knows about Jaim&#39;s secret and his fully supportive of him to the point that they help him on the field. So good."
"2200","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"DC has so many cool characters outside of the Justice League, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re doing this."
"2201","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I love how open the community is to the changes on how blue beetle is being portrayed"
"2202","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Love how his first instinct when he was told he could make anything is to make a final fantasy looking sword lol, love the Vibe of this movie so much"
"2203","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"Who else is ready to witness the rise of the Blue Beetle ? <br>Can‚Äôt wait to see this on the big screen with my fellow superhero fans."
"2204","Blue Beetle",2023-04-05,"I will never forget seeing Blue Beetle for the first time ever in &quot;Batman Brave &amp; the Bold&quot;. I thought he was so cool and always enjoyed his story arc in anything. I was surprised to see him in &quot;Young Justice&quot; as well. And then when he popped up in Injustice 2 and I was estatic. And now his own movie?? Let&#39;s goooo they better do it justice"
"2205","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"<b>Blue Beetle</b> is one of my favorite DC superheroes and this trailer looks absolutely epic! I can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie on the big screen!"
"2206","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I hope this movie will do well at the box office. I love Xolo from watching him in Cobra Kai, and I love DC introducing a Latino superhero!"
"2207","Blue Beetle",2023-04-03,"I like how at the end of these new DC trailers, they make recommendations for comics and encourages viewers to visit comic shops. <br>Definitely a cool move!"
"2208","Blue Beetle",2023-04-14,"the way this looks like it could actually compete with a marvel movie gives me so much hope for this movie"
"2209","Blue Beetle",2023-04-08,"I&#39;m glad Xolo is moving on to other projects. I like him in cobra kai and I always think its sad when someone plays a character you like on a show and you never see them again in anything else. I hope he keeps working and does good things in his future."
"2210","Blue Beetle",2023-04-04,"<b>Rae Sremmurd has entered the chat</b>"

"2214","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"I love the twisting halls, stretching walls, and disappearing windows. The mansion is only sturdy when it wants to be."
"2215","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"If Disney can pull off a scary movie, that would be really something worth celebrating"
"2216","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-25,"I love how we have a comedy version of the haunted mansion in the 2003 film and now a more scarier one. This is exactly how Goff and Anderson wanted the attraction to be like. Scary but also comedic."
"2217","Haunted Mansion",2023-07-07,"I&#39;ve been obsessed with the Haunted Mansion for years. The way they&#39;ve brought the characters to life in this film looks amazing. I&#39;m ready to take the ride!"
"2218","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"So long as Raven Symone sings about superstition, I&#39;m all in."
"2219","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"This is what Disney needs nowadays. Instead of cashing in on those unnecessary live action remakes that&#39;s getting stale, make a new story, in this case based on their theme park rides into movies. Even if it doesn&#39;t work, i still apprciate their effort in trying something new. Just like Tomorrowland which was a pretty underrated movie and prefer to watch that over the Disney remakes"
"2220","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-17,"Definitely gonna be watching"
"2221","Haunted Mansion",2023-06-28,"If this movie can re create the terror waiting in line for 3 hours to ride the mansion then I‚Äôm in. Nothing is more terrifying üëª"
"2222","Haunted Mansion",2023-06-06,"It&#39;s so cool to see the inspiration they&#39;ve taken from the first film (an underrated classic) and the ride! Consider me hyped ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"2223","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"Even though the 2003 Eddie Murphy version does hold a special place in my heart, I <i>can‚Äôt</i> deny that this looks MIGHTY interesting (üëç)!"

"2225","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"This is how you do a reboot. Looks awesome. Danny is just Frank and I love it"
"2226","Haunted Mansion",2023-06-28,"Glad you decided to get those grim, grinning ghosts in the trailer.   The movie feels so much like the ride.  And the decision to avoid<br>outdated horror movie tropes like Steven King&#39;s The Shining and the Exorcist, just brilliant! After watching this trailer, I&#39;m convinced all Disney-philes and children will flock to this movie!  Kudos, standing ovation!"
"2227","Haunted Mansion",2023-06-21,"Finally the hatbox ghost gets the part of the movie! This is awsome!"
"2228","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"Finally, a revive old character from the old version of the ride <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLKTz81bj8&amp;t=80"">1:20</a>"
"2229","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"Second trailer and it&#39;s looking even better. love that it&#39;s sticking to a very creepy feel and seems to reduce the humor quite a bit. Was very uncertain originally, but now I&#39;m all in on this."
"2230","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"They‚Äôre really respecting the ride it seems, definitely gonna be watching"
"2231","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-18,"I remember being terrified of this ride as a kid. Now that I&#39;ve gotten older with an obsession of movies, this will be a fun and interesting way to experience the ride!"
"2232","Haunted Mansion",2023-05-16,"One, Rosario Dawson‚Äôs character being named Gabbie and spelled that way has me soooo happy. Two, Captain Gore hint at the end as me SCREAMING. Three, the Hat Box ghost looks amazing.  Four, it seems like this plot is exactly like what the predicted lord of the Hatbox Ghost and Constance Hatchaway had been implying. That he was her accomplice/secret lover who helped her with her killing"

"2309","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-19,"The mother phrase at the door, the way she says it, her expression.. and also what the child says in her simplicity... GENIUS!!!<br>horror filmmakers should learn!"
"2310","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-07,"Evil Dead was the first actual horror movie I saw as kid. This name itself gives me goosebumps."
"2311","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-10,"I love how the Evil Dead series works either as comedy horror or just balls to the wall horror.  Can&#39;t wait!"
"2312","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-06,"The Evil Dead movie franchise literally bats 1000. Not a single bad film in the collection. <br><br>This looks absolutely wild and feels like it‚Äôs going to give the 2013 remake a run for its money‚Ä¶which is crazy because it was already REALLY good."
"2313","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-09,"Loved it when the little girl opened the door for her mommy. Must have left the keys at work or something, so it&#39;s a good thing she was there for her. so wholesome"

"2315","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-09,"I think Evil Dead is one of the only movie franchises that can actually pull off horror and gore at the same time, so many &quot;Horror movies&quot; now a days are just blood and gore with little horror in them, Evil Dead seems to be one of the only few franchises to actually achieve the horror part of their movies and I love them for that!

"2321","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-05,"The main thing I love about this is that it feels like The Evil Dead remake, it has the style and the creepiness and it&#39;s looks like it&#39;s gonna have the over the top badass gore that I loved from that remake, Fede Alvarez isn&#39;t even directing this and yet they find a way to make it feel like it&#39;s directed by him, cannot wait to see this!!"
"2322","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-06,"I love the sheer look of terror on the characters faces as the voice is reciting the words from the necronomicon over the record."
"2323","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"I love how Evil Dead exists in two extremes, we got full blown Evil Dead 2 camp in Ash vs Evil Dead and full on horror/gore in the remake and this it seems. Looks awesome."
"2324","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"The cheese grater used as a defense weapon to a protagonist is a freaking smart move.. i felt my skin tighten to that clip.. cant wait to watch this."
"2325","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"Love when a trailer manages to put my skepticism to rest. This looks absolutely brutal and a worthy successor to the 2013 remake"
"2326","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-08,"the use of practical effects is so effective it‚Äôs what i loved about the 2013 movie and looks like they are going to do it similar in this one, evil dead are genuinely the only movies that can make me squirm! hopefully this one is as good as it looks!"

"2328","Evil Dead Rise",2023-02-12,"I love how the way they do their roles from bottom of their heart to make audience feel thrilled. And I love how the way, girl opens the door with all her innocence and ask why she is not looking good, and secondly I love how the ghost says that mommy is maggots now it feels really horror"
"2329","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-18,"Thank you for keeping the horror genre alive üôå"
"2330","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"As a huge fan of the Originals and Bruce Campbell, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I love the comedy/ silliness of 2 and Army of Darkness. I also liked the more serious nature  of 1 and the remake. I gotta say this looks better than the 2013 remake. Which is exciting cause I like the remake. I&#39;m glad they went serious because not sure if anyone could pull off the one liners like Bruce does lol."
"2331","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"This looks amazing, same vibes as 2013 remake. It‚Äôs going be super bloody."

"2341","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-08,"I remember when the last film came out, not a single film since has made me grit my teeth, and left me exhausted after watching because of the tension. Now they&#39;re making a new one? And it looks even more gritty? three days after my birthday? Man what a time to be alive."
"2342","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-12,"The Evil Dead of 2013 was absolutely insane."

"2351","Evil Dead Rise",2023-02-22,"Man, this trailer alone has all the the great parts from the Evil Dead series, Ash vs Evil Dead, and the 2013 evil Dead movie all into one and I love it! What a Sam Rami classic~ the Dutch cam, the cam tilting, camera zoom, room filled with blood to the brim, sharp objects mm close to the eyes, and of course, the chainsaw ~ you can&#39;t have an evil Dead franchise without the chainsaw &lt;3"
"2352","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"So happy that this actually looks very good. I am excited now."
"2353","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-07,"About time, I&#39;ve missed this kind of horror.  It&#39;s been a long time."

"2355","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-20,"A horror franchise that never loses, It is quite remarkable to consider how Ash effortlessly kills these creatures while still maintaining his sense of humor."
"2356","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-04,"Let go!!!! Finally, a good horror movie. Can‚Äôt wait üò¶"
"2357","Evil Dead Rise",2023-04-06,"loved this franchise ever since I was a little kid and I found my parents VHS copy of Evil Dead 2. Even though many people found it comical I was really young and it scared the shit out of me. Army of Darkness was great and I enjoyed the 2013 remake. I can&#39;t wait to see this one, the incantation being played aloud in that tone definitely set the mood, love it."
"2358","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-06,"I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I heard about this movie. If the trailer hasn&#39;t taken all of the good scenes from the movie, then this for me is a must see in theaters."
"2359","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-10,"while i love the more comical side of the original evil dead&#39;s, I do enjoy that they&#39;re willing to explore the truly horrific side of it as well. hoping for mostly practical effects in this. I&#39;ve been obsessed with all these films since 2020 when the pandemic hit. something about them just scratches that itch for me - the terror, the visuals, the gore. Just a beautiful combination. Looking forward to more of these in the future!"
"2360","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-09,"Evil Dead was the best horror movie made in 1980s...and its sequels haven&#39;t really disappointed to scare us either"
"2361","Evil Dead Rise",2023-01-28,"The best horror franchise of all time. Nothing beats Evil Dead."

"2366","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"The Exorcist was the greatest horror film ever made, it&#39;s going to be incredibly difficult to match it&#39;s raw power and shock value no matter how many jump scares are are added to the edit"
"2367","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-28,"Lifelong horror fan here. I watched The original Exorcist in 1975 when I was in my early teens and I still consider it one of the scariest films ever, if not the scariest. What made it so powerful IMO was the slow buildup with a gradual incursion of evil into very real, gritty lives of people who seemed absolutely credible. The tension was rising, the setting and characters were 100% believable, so that by the time the pea soup was flying, you were all in. The problem with a lot of Hollywood horror now is that they don&#39;t take the time to build up that tension or develop the characters, and just go overboard with over-the-top, all-out explosions of supernatural phenonema in your face 15 minutes in, so that you&#39;re just numb to it."
"2368","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The Exorcist was the greatest horror film ever made"
"2369","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"I wish that I was able to experience the same thing audiences experienced when the original first came out. It literally scared people into church, people were fainting in movie theaters. <br>The original is truly the best horror movie ever made"
"2370","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"One of the reasons why The Exorcist worked for me was that it was based on much older times. The tone of the film felt different and you could feel the evil lurking in the shadows even though the film didn&#39;t show anything. It just gave out an eerie feeling all by itself. It&#39;s worth noting that when The Exorcist was released, it was the first time the public had ever seen anything like it and therefore had such an impact on people. Similar to Star Wars, at the time it was the first of its kind and so it was extremely successful. This new film right away has that modern take which removes a layer of horror already. You don&#39;t get the same feeling of horror when the girl walks into the church as you do when Regan walks into the living room and urinates herself. Not saying this film will suck, I&#39;m simply making observations and opinions. Still I am very excited for this to come out and I hope its a good one!"
"2371","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-27,"i don‚Äôt think people realize what made the original movie so scary was the lack of media like it at the time. people had never seen something like that presented on screen, leading to a huge cultural impact, that today we just don‚Äôt find shocking."
"2372","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-07,"RIP William Friedkin, the legendary director of The Exorcist, single-handedly the most iconic and terrifying film ever made."
"2373","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-09-03,"To have Ellen Burnstyn return to her role as Chris MacNeil 50 years later at 90 years old is incredible. So glad she signed on to this project."
"2374","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"The reason the original exorcist works so well is because it felt real, it felt like a documentary, it was claustrophobic and centred around one room for the most part. the script and the dialogue was terrifying,  language that we had never heard before.<br><br> modern films just looked to digitally clean and fresh now, they don&#39;t have the look of the films from the 70s that realism that grit"
"2375","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-30,"My mother saw the original Exorcist in the theatre, someone actually had a seizure while watching it. That‚Äôs how crazy it was. There are documentaries which explain the sheer pandemonium around the original. Nothing will ever come close."
"2376","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The original will always and forever remain the scariest movie of all times, not only did it feel real, the sets and the things the production team did to make it feel real is INSANE, like the swing camera from the stairs going up, the cold room to get the effect form their mouths, and the make up, etc. etc."
"2377","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The fact that it can still creep me out, it means something. The Exorcist is still haunting the theaters."
"2378","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-27,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve met before.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMother.‚Äù<br><br>My God, I got such chills. And the music being integrated piece by piece was brilliant."
"2379","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-28,"The original came out at a time when nobody saw anything like it. There was suspense and desent from being a normal person to a depraved, possessed monster was gradual. We went on a journey with the mother through the doctor&#39;s tests and theories about what the trouble with the child was. The book was stunning in that respect. So, as the interviews with Blatty states, the film had a sort of  documentary feel about it. So, considering all of that along with all of the movies depicting demonic possession, I have my doubts about this being very scary. Unless the director has done something we haven&#39;t seen before in this movie."
"2380","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"I‚Äôm glad this is a direct sequel and not a ‚Äúremake‚Äù trailer looks very solid and promising. I‚Äôll definitely be seeing this in the movies"
"2381","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-28,"For those who are commenting that the original Exorcist was not that scary or &quot;Saw&quot; or other horror movies were much scarier, either did not experience this movie in the 70&#39;s or watched it on television. Watching this movie in a theater back in the day was the most horrifying experience for almost all and no amount of convincing those who just didn&#39;t have that experience will never understand, period!"
"2382","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-08,"The creators of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; could never have anticipated that their scripting efforts would result in the creation of the most iconic and legendary horror film in existence. Remarkably, they experienced a profound connection to the essence of their work during its production, sensing a genuine presence of the supernatural forces they were portraying."
"2383","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-13,"This trailer doesn‚Äôt hit the same as it does in theaters, I get chills every time I watch it in theaters"
"2384","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The biggest challenge for this movie is gonna be the fact that the original movie still scares the living hell out of people , so for this movie to do well , it has to be better than the original one , which is gonna be a hard task. All the best to the creators of this movie , I hope your movie does well enough to make another one next year."
"2385","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"The exorcist after 50 years still the Best horror movie ever made"

"2388","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"I remember watching The Exorcist as a kid and how badly I was traumatized, but now is my favorite horror movie haha. I know this will be a new generation of horror and I cannot wait. This looks terrifying."
"2389","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"When we saw the trailer at the beginning of Oppenheimer, the crowd lost their minds when Tubular Bells started blasting! It was the best reaction I‚Äôve seen for a movie trailer in a packed theatre in a long time!"
"2390","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-07,"I actually had goosebumps when Ellen Burstyn appeared. What an actress, what a movie (referring to the original). I will give it a chance !"
"2391","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-09-28,"I still get chills down my spine every time I hear that theme start playing."
"2392","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The original theme song slowly fading into the trailer piece by piece is amazing whoever thought of that needs a raise"
"2393","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-31,"I know it probably can‚Äôt top the original, but this actually looks good and freaky af. Most horror films these days are just bad but hopefully they did this right."
"2394","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-09-22,"RIP William Friedkin. Your original masterpiece will never ever be surpassed. The very essence of true filmmaking on the edge of what was possible."
"2395","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"There will never be a more scary movie than the original exorcist"
"2396","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"There will never be another film quite like The Exorcist, but this looks like a promising sequel."
"2397","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"One thing I‚Äôll give this trailer alone is the overall aesthetic that The Exorcist films always have.<br><br>From what I see so far, it isn‚Äôt relying a whole lot on jump scares but rather the horror of demon possession. That‚Äôs what made the first Exorcist film so haunting, and exceptionally horrifying.<br><br>This movie won‚Äôt top the 1973 classic but I appreciate how close it‚Äôs trying to replicate the vibe from the first film."
"2398","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The Exorcist is a haunting masterpiece that explores faith, doubt, and the battle between good and evil, resonates deeply with believers in prayer and exorcism."
"2399","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"I‚Äôve never wanted a movie to be good more than this. I really hope it‚Äôs good"
"2400","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Wow!  Seeing Ellen Burstyn reprise her role as Chris McNeill is insanely awesome! This movie was released when I was born. I&#39;m a big fan of the original. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
"2401","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-29,"I love all the references to the original. Like when the girl says ‚Äúmother please make it stop‚Äù - that‚Äôs exactly what Regan said in the original. With the exception of ‚Äúit‚Äôs burning‚Äù vs ‚Äúit‚Äôs hurting‚Äù. Also the flashing scenes at the end of this trailer references a banned trailer from the original 70s version. I don‚Äôt exactly remember the reason it got banned, but I believe it had to do with seizures (?). Super excited for this."
"2402","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-28,"This actually looks pretty good. It‚Äôs hard to live up to the hype of the original exorcist movie 50 years ago, but this definitely has my interest."
"2403","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"I ABSOLUTELY love how they played the score in between certain scenes for all those that know the sound of it!"
"2404","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Ngl... the part where she says &quot;God played a trick on you..&quot; smiles and then the loud black and white imagery flashing with sounds and the theme song then plays was SOO GOOD. Saw this as a trailer during Oppenheimer and was surprised how great this looked! üëèüèΩ"
"2405","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-03,"The talent those young actresses have is astonishing, not many can portray what people say demon possesion looks like realistically."
"2406","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"You can‚Äôt beat a classic no matter how good they make this it‚Äôll never be as good it‚Äôs impossible"
"2407","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-01,"Recommend listening to Ellen talk about people fainting on first viewing of the exorcist. I remember reading about ppl going into churches so many people were so affected as it was a Oscar film about one of the most traumatic Terrifying subjects that could ever be covered. The acting was just outstanding the effects  way ahead of their time they‚Äôre still mind blowing, especially the end scenes it was more than a film. It was an absolutely phenomenal and I really give it so much support for them to try and come up with another sequel as it‚Äôs so difficult to follow perfection."
"2408","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"The Exorcist is an absolute classic in The Horror Genre. Can‚Äôt wait for this movie."
"2409","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> I love how Chris says ‚Äúwe‚Äôve met before‚Äù, her playing a major role in this film is one of the only reasons I‚Äôm holding out hope that it‚Äôll be good. Plus, Leslie Odom Jr. is a fantastic actor, so I‚Äôm sure he and Ellen Burstyn will be the highlights. But I think it would be more impactful if Regan and Chris were helping Leslie‚Äôs character together, and Regan should have delivered the ‚Äúwe‚Äôve met before‚Äù line to Pazuzu instead of her mom. It‚Äôd be more effective because REGAN was the one who suffered the most at his hands. I wanna see her get revenge on Pazuzu."
"2410","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-31,"I was a kid when The Exorcist came out in 1973, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to see it, but everyone I knew who did was scared liked never before. There had never been anything like it, and it really freaked people out. When I was old enough to see it, I couldn‚Äôt get it out my mind for over a month. Even now at 50+ years old, I still cannot watch it, not even trailers. <br>This trailer did not scare me, the horror of the original cannot be matched."
"2411","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"It is nice to see, no matter how the film is remade, that they managed to bring back Ellen Burstyn! Also this looks more promising in tone with the original film, as opposed to any of the later sequels from the 2000s and even that TV remake. I‚Äôll have hope this will be scary!"
"2412","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Oh my God. Just hearing that theme again, ....goosebumps. I hope this movie terrifies this generation like the original did."
"2413","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-10-02,"First watched The Exorcist with my mum. She was in the theatre when she watched it first and witnessed people throwing up, fainting etc. she decided to watch this with me one October evening while I was about 10-11 years old! One of my all time favourite films. This actually looks pretty good, and I‚Äôm excited to see it in full."
"2414","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"It just isn&#39;t the same without the genius of William Peter Blatty. Exorcist 1 and 3 are absolute masterpieces that simply cannot be surpassed by the modern style of directing and movie making. It was what Blatty DIDN&#39;T show on screen - by arriving late and cutting early that was so damned scary. Watch them again with this in mind and you&#39;ll see what I mean. With all that being said, this did send a bit of a chill up my spine, especially when Chris McNeil showed up on screen. I&#39;ll be checking it out for sure. The way they only played a small part of the tubular bells theme from the original interspersed between cuts until the black and white flashes towards the end was very well done btw. But people just don&#39;t get that the original movie is not really about possession, it&#39;s about the loss of faith. That faith being chipped away at bit by bit, by small but constant evils, and the re-discovery of that FAITH when confronted by a terrible and nearly overwhelming evil."
"2415","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-12,"‚ÄúThe body and the blood‚Äù part and their heartbeats is what sold me. This looks fantastic"
"2416","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"What I love about this movie is Chris MacNiel&#39;s determination to help other girls that went through the same hell as her daughter Regan."

"2418","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-31,"I saw this trailer in the theater last night. At first I thought it looked super bad, as the trailer went on I found myself sinking farther into my seat. Excited to see this!"
"2419","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-09,"I was very into horror as a kid growing up in the 90s. As a general rule, my parents would let me watch/rent any horror movie I wanted except one...The Exorcist. My mom would go on to tell me she saw it in theaters and was so disturbed by it that she didn&#39;t want that movie in the house and was afraid it would traumatize me. I finally saw it when I was 15 or so."
"2420","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-07,"My mother saw The Exorcist (1973) in theaters, she was only 8 years old at the time. It‚Äôs her all time favorite horror movie, and the only movie she deems ‚Äústill scares the shit out of her‚Äù. I remember we went to Blockbuster back around 2001 and rented The Exorcist for a family movie night. I watched it at 5 years old! Anyways, the movie was so traumatizing for me, I only made it to the spider walk scene before running out of the room in terror. In our house, at the time, we had a set of stairs similar to the one in that scene just above our tv area in the living room and after watching that, I never liked looking at the stairs at night anymore for the rest of my childhood. It took me 10 years later to get through my fear and actually sit down and watch The Exorcist in full when I was then 15. I absolutely love the movie now and it‚Äôs a must play every October for me, but it still makes my skin crawl every time I watch it, especially during the Pazuzu jump scares. Now, just as back then for my mom, I will go see this one in theaters. I don‚Äôt expect it to top the original, but I hope it represents the franchise right this time after many bad remakes and sequels in the years after and pays homage to the original respectfully."
"2421","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-09-05,"I was 11 years old when I saw the original at the drive in theater with my parents and my little brother.  It was scary indeed, but thoroughly enjoyed it."
"2422","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Still till this day The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever and still gives me chills. Definitely excited to see what this movie brings to the table"
"2423","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"The Exorcist is the one true SCARY movie. I can watch horror movies all day every day and not feel what the first one made me feel as a child and still as an adult. It is cinematic perfection. Still holds up to this very day, let alone impacting the world like it did in ‚Äò73. I surely hope this one holds up. Exorcism movies are getting kind of tired and formulaic. I hope this one is the freshness the genre needs."
"2424","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Honestly I‚Äôm so excited to see Ellen back! She‚Äôs a phenomenal actress even now!"
"2425","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"I was skeptical in the beginning until I stuck till the end of the trailer. The Original Exorcist is one of my all time favorite horror films and this looks promising."
"2426","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-02,"I saw the original when I was 10 years old in a pitch black room by myself. It was both amazing and terrifying. Little did I know how much the original scarred me as I cannot watch ANY movie with demonic possessions as a plot. What a masterpiece!"
"2427","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-26,"Can we all just acknowledge how incredible Ellen Burstyn looks here at 90 YEARS OLD! She is a living Hollywood Legend. Would never put her at 90 if I didn&#39;t know."
"2428","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-10,"I‚Äôm here to give full credit to the person who edited this trailer. The way he threw in the Tubular bells by Mike Oldfield (music from the original Exorcist) is what made my ears perk up. I was sitting there waiting for Oppenheimer to start and thought here‚Äôs a trailer for yet another horror film but then the bells played‚Ä¶.and stopped‚Ä¶.and my heart stopped, and I said to myself‚Äô ‚Äúcould it be‚Ä¶? It can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ ‚Äú and then I yelled both in horror and excitement that IT ISSSS.‚Äù  Full marks to the editor!!üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºThat build up was everything."

"2432","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-15,"There&#39;s no way it can be as good as the original, but this is the first trailer in years that legit creeped me out."
"2433","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-27,"The original is groundbreaking and terrifying to this day. It doesn&#39;t look like they are trying to mimic it but just tell a story and that&#39;s a smart thing. Getting Ellen back was another smart thing. The fact they got her back for this movie when they couldnt get her for the sequel and the third movie pretty says it&#39;s good because she liked the script enough to come back. Linda returning for the sequel will just be the icing on the cake and feel full circle. I can&#39;t wait to see it."
"2434","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-25,"Some recent horror movies have fallen short on the scare factor. However, I must say, this one looks quite promising! The trailer alone gave me chills, and the storyline seems good. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a film that relies on atmospheric horror and psychological suspense rather than just cheap jump scares. Fingers crossed that it lives up to its potential and delivers the spine-tingling experience we‚Äôve been craving. Can‚Äôt wait to see it! üï∑Ô∏è"
"2435","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-08-04,"No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be better than the original, but I‚Äôm not going into expecting something better. I just hope it‚Äôs a good, well made possession horror. The trailer looks promising and those two girls seem like they are gonna give amazing performances. Which is something that made the original so iconic, the performance of the young girl Linda Blair."

"2440","The Exorcist: Believer",2023-07-31,"Can‚Äôt wait to see this! My mom was pregnant with me when the first Exorcist came out.

"2443","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-05,"This is beautiful. Best true story I&#39;ve ever seen. For five minutes, from the moment this bear ate the cocaine, to the moment it died of a heart attack it was the world&#39;s apex predator. And now it&#39;s on the big screen."
"2444","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-03,"Give this bear an Oscar. Not only did it do cocaine in such large quantity, it also didn&#39;t die of a heart attack immediately!"

"2451","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-04,"The &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; movie I always wanted, and it&#39;s apparently going to be the Horror/Comedy I never knew I wanted. Long live Pablo Escobear."
"2452","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-01,"This movie actually brings some horror b-movie vibes of the 1980s, gory and funny AF in that sense. And I&#39;m surprised Ray Liotta made an appearance in this film before his passing. Also, the fact that Cocaine Bear is inspired by a true story, that&#39;s pretty hard to believe.

"2462","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-04,"I think the most hilarious part about this is the fact that side from the comedy bits, this story is true. A bear did get into cocaine and for like 5 minutes or something, it was the absolute most dangerous animal on the planet before it did eventually die"
"2463","Cocaine Bear",2022-11-30,"Looks insanely fun, I love these movies that don‚Äôt take themselves seriously, and the fact it‚Äôs based on a true story is hilarious"

"2465","Cocaine Bear",2022-12-09,"Finally a movie with top of the line CGI and a rich well-written plot. The way the comedy flows into the horror makes for an exceptional experience, leaving family‚Äôs just on the line of wondering what they just watched.

"2516","A Man Called Otto",2022-11-07,"My wife and I were in Pittsburgh for an appointment, arrived way too early so we went for a walk. We saw a film crew setting up, they had streets blocked off, so for curiosities sake we stood by and watched for a moment. Out of nowhere, Tom Hanks walked right up to my wife and I... even though he was wearing a face mask he was instantly recognizable and as he approached my wife said &quot;OMG it&#39;s Tom Hanks&quot;!!! Mr Hanks pretended to look about frantically and said &quot;REALLY? WHERE????!!!&quot; and we laughed. He stood and talked to us, took a photo with us, and was so kind. Anyway, he did that because we were in an area where we weren&#39;t supposed to be, and someone on the film crew was about to come over and yell at us and Tom Hanks scolded the person and decided to just come over and talk to us, rather than someone yelling at us. We had no idea what actor was there or even why the camera&#39;s were being set up, we were just people going for a walk. Thank you Mr Hanks for making our day that day, and for your overwhelming kindness!"
"2517","A Man Called Otto",2022-11-03,"I read A Man Called Ove when i went to rehabilitation for alcoholism. I don&#39;t think I ever appreciated how much joy and love there is in this world outside of my negative, depressing, loveless ways of thinking about the world around me. 60 days of being internal with no tv, cell phone, or news, just books. And Ove, well, he changed my life. I always imagined Robert Dinero or Tom Hanks playing Ove in my head. I literally just thought about the book looking back just now and to my surprise a movie is coming out this soon. Unreal. Although I am sober right now there are times where i start with that negative thinking and i remind myself all the love i would lose if i drank again. Thank you to the original Author of a Man Called Ove, thank you to T.Hanks and his crew for making this movie , and to the makers of the original swedish version (which i didn&#39;t even know or thought it would exist until now).<br><br>Here&#39;s to being sober.

"2520","A Man Called Otto",2023-05-20,"I loved that the protagonist grew and started to heal with the help of platonic friends (particularly Marisol&#39;s family) and neighbors and not with the help of a romantic interest. We need more movies like this. It was absolutely the best one I&#39;ve seen in a while. So many amazing messages and it was just absolutely touching. There are many people struggling just like Otto, and sometimes with a little compassion, love, patience and a dash of humor we may just be able to be a &quot;Marisol&quot; to someone or an &quot;Otto&quot; to someone like Malcolm and vice versa or really any of the amazing characters in this film that loved one another (particularly Otto) when they most needed it and help them through the darkness to the light. <br>‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê"

One of those movies that is supremely feel-good and at the same time it had a sad hint to it and the acting was phenomenal.

Not only the writer and the director do I applaud, but every single actor and actress in this movie played their specific roles better than I have ever seen in a single movie. It truly is astounding, and as a young man who embellishes and loves movies and has been intrigued to them for a long time with my girlfriend, I give my honest word that this is in no doubt too 5 films I have ever seen. Warning, it‚Äôs not for the faint hearted and if you are, please take full note of the movie and realize there is so much love to be found. God bless you all"

"2565","A Man Called Otto",2023-03-10,"Actually my wife and I recently looked into the cinema programme and decided there was nothing that really tickled our fancy. However, a few days ago, the evening before a holiday we decided on a little date night and just went for A Man Called Otto, which in my mind is a beautiful piece of film! I didn&#39;t even watch the trailer beforehand, so except the few bits of info my wife fed me, I wasn&#39;t really sure what we were getting into. I think I can confidently say that I have never cried this much during a film. From the reveal of what happened to the wife and the baby over to Otto becoming a sort of grandpa to Marisol&#39;s kids just took me on an emotional rollercoaster. I envisioned becoming a father one day, making my dad a grandpa, which I know he&#39;d love and be awesome at. Those were the tears of excitement and joy. At the same time, I remembered my own grandpa who passed over 16 years ago and I am still very sad sometimes that he isn&#39;t around anymore. Furthermore, my wife and I have not even been married for a full year and known each other for just over five but the film made me go through all the memories we&#39;ve made so far, making me even more thankful for her being with me, me not being alone and having someone by my side to love and cherrish the time together. This made me feel positive about the future and what is to come for us.<br>I will probably carry the memories from this one forward for a long time. It has a special place in my heart.<br>Thank you, Mr. Tom Hanks for playing this character in such a great way and thank you to the entire cast and crew for making such a wonderful piece of film. In my opinion this one deserves a few awards! Greetings and lots of love from Berlin, Germany."

"2576","A Man Called Otto",2023-01-17,"I went to go and see this just to keep my mother company. And I was in awe about it. It was awesome. I laughed, tears was coming out. It gave me a 80‚Äôs love of one‚Äôs neighborhood, everyone look out for each other, family vibe."
"2577","A Man Called Otto",2022-12-30,"My favorite scene in the Swedish movie version is when Ove tries to hang himself and the rope breaks, so he takes the rope back to the store to get his money back."

Tom Hanks never disappoints. This is just one great movie."

"2585","A Man Called Otto",2022-10-26,"Can&#39;t wait for this, not many people know this, but A Man called Ove was originally a series of blog posts by Fredrik Backman before he became a famous author, the blogs about Ove were very popular in Sweden long before I think even Fredrik was thinking about making it into a book. <br>We all have a piece of Ove within us and I think that&#39;s what makes him such a relatable character, the book and the movie is so heartfelt you&#39;d have to be dead inside not to feel it....the trailer looks awesome, Tom Hanks is perfect for this role."
"2586","A Man Called Otto",2023-04-29,"I have read and seen every adaptation of this story. It makes you think about life and cry without fail every time."
"2587","A Man Called Otto",2022-11-09,"I read ‚Äúa man called ove‚Äù years ago and absolutely loved it. I‚Äôve read several other books by Fredrick Backman after and they are always lovely. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie."

"2593","A Man Called Otto",2023-08-28,"Tom hanks movies never disappoints. I&#39;ve watched him since i was a kid. Toy story, cast away, the terminal, forest gump and many more. Also they always gave me mix emotional too. Love this man"
"2594","A Man Called Otto",2023-05-21,"I cried so much!!!!! Wow! Beautiful movie and beautiful message-<br>We all need community and a sense of purposeüíõ be ready to cry!!!!"
"2595","A Man Called Otto",2022-11-25,"I can already tell that I&#39;m going to really like it. not only because Tom Hanks just gets better with age. but because I heard the super group. &quot;The Traveling Wibury&#39;s&quot; and the song &quot;End of the Line&quot;. one of my all time favorites."
"2596","A Man Called Otto",2023-05-22,"This movie is not about story, action, twist and turns but about feeling and smile on your face while watching it ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"2597","A Man Called Otto",2023-09-29,"Tom Hanks, for me, one of the only well-known actors that completely disappears every time I start one of his movies. When I‚Äôm watching him, I never find myself thinking, ‚ÄúWow. Tom‚Äôs really killing it. I am so impressed,‚Äù because I forgot that Tom was in it about five minutes in, and am instead just watching Otto go about his life. <br><br>I forget how good Tom is sometimes, but when I remember, I remember that he‚Äôs one of the greats."
"2598","A Man Called Otto",2023-01-25,"This gives me a nostalgic feeling about going out to see a movie in the 90s. It didnt have to be a blockbuster just a fun night of  &quot;going to the movies&quot; like we used to say."
"2599","A Man Called Otto",2023-04-09,"I just watched Otto.  It‚Äôs a real tear jerker, especially the ending‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm a crierüò¢.  I loved Truman Hanks, he was wonderful, a real natural.  The moment he started talking I thought hmmm?  But I knew for sure the moment he started running Thats Tom‚Äôs son.  His new neighbor Marisol was fantastic!  I loved her 2-seconds in, I wanted to hug by the end of the movie.  Beautiful film‚Ä¶Congratulations Tom &amp; Rita. ‚úåÔ∏èüíûüå∑"
"2600","A Man Called Otto",2023-08-21,"There are very few movies that you just know you&#39;ll remember all your life and will keep in your heart forever.  This is one of them."
"2601","A Man Called Otto",2023-05-17,"Tom Hanks knocks another one out of the park with this. The writers that did the story knocked out our of the park.  I found myself smiling,  laughing, and crying throughout the movie. Everybody involved with this movie did outstanding. <br>We need more stories like this to enjoy."
"2602","A Man Called Otto",2023-06-14,"It was on sale 5$ at the Xbox marketplace. My first thought was ‚Äúthis is so predictable.‚Äù By the time the film ended I hadn‚Äôt cried that hard since I was a kid and ET went up in the spaceship. Loved it!"
"2603","A Man Called Otto",2023-08-06,"This was the best movie Ive seen since very long and by far the best Tom Hanks movie!<br>I laughed, I cried and not a single boring moment.<br>Cant believe Hollywood is still able making such good movies wow!!"
"2604","Wish",2023-10-14,"her personality down to the way she speaks and her expressions are identical to like every disney protagonist we‚Äôve had since tangled. is this not exhausting to anyone?"
"2605","Wish",2023-10-02,"I actually don‚Äôt think the king is wrong in not granting every wish‚Ä¶ curious to see where Disney takes this."
"2606","Wish",2023-10-02,"I hope she learns that everyone getting everything they want all the time isn&#39;t always what&#39;s best for anyone. Looks cozy!"
"2607","Wish",2023-09-27,"please Disney, make this film a classic.  we want to see more fairy tales, this is your gift in creating stories"
"2608","Wish",2023-09-29,"You know, even though the king seems like the villain I think he‚Äôs probably right that granting everyone‚Äôs wishes would be a bad thing."
"2609","Wish",2023-11-16,"Giving the villain a crazy look every now and then won&#39;t make people hate him. Dude literally has a point."
"2610","Wish",2023-10-07,"Who else is rooting for the king?<br>It would be a crazy twist that I‚Äôm all for.<br>People shouldn‚Äôt get everything they want, that would be a horrible message. Especially for kids."
"2611","Wish",2023-10-09,"Sick of Disney‚Äôs ‚Äúquirky‚Äù humor. We haven‚Äôt had a mature but interesting and unique female protagonist since Tiana."
"2612","Wish",2023-09-29,"So this King has the power to grant wishes, uses it to control his Kingdom and give it peace, but since he‚Äôs only granting the wishes that won‚Äôt cause problems he‚Äôs the bad guy, but his daughter awakens the same ability and now she not only threatens him but wants to use her powers to grant every wish even if that might not be good"
"2613","Wish",2023-10-21,"It&#39;s a worrying sign, that the trailer makes me agree with the &quot;bad guy&quot; and root for him.<br>But hopefully they will provide us a nuanced story about why not everyone gets their wish, but from the trailer I 100% agree with the king."
"2614","Wish",2023-09-28,"I watched this and was very confused how I was supposed to view the king as a bad guy. Granting every wish without restriction sounds like a bad idea. Not everyone has good intentions."
"2615","Wish",2023-10-02,"It looks better than a lot of what disneys been putting out, but im not convinced the villain is THAT evil and I&#39;m worried the message is gonna just be &quot;do what feels right no matter the consequences&quot;"
"2616","Wish",2023-10-18,"Imagine if Disney made a real hand-drawn movie again."
"2617","Wish",2023-10-02,"Disney achieves the impossible and makes the protagonist the antagonist and the villian is most likely the hero of the story."
"2618","Wish",2023-09-27,"Yes!!! Disney is finally back with fairytales with musical numbers, a powerful villain, magic, animal sidekick, and the Princess. This is where Disney shines in creative storytelling."
"2619","Wish",2023-09-27,"Honestly I‚Äôm loving how there‚Äôs a villain that‚Äôs established so early rather than a twist one."
"2620","Wish",2023-10-19,"She sounds and looks exactly like every other girl in every other Disney movie"
"2621","Wish",2023-11-14,"The King doesn&#39;t just have a point, he should be the real hero. If everyone deserved to be granted everything their hearts desired, then that would mean that you&#39;d have to grant such wishes as a genocidal maniac wanting to destroy entire peoples, or evil advisors wanting to usurp the throne and become the most powerful sorcerer in the universe."
"2622","Wish",2023-10-22,"Anyone remember Bruce all mighty, when he found out how bad it was to say &quot;yes to all&quot; when answering everyone&#39;s prayers?"
"2623","Wish",2023-11-15,"Arianna: Everbody should have their wish granted! Not just the one&#39;s you choose!<br><br>King: One guy wished for women to be obedient slaves.<br><br>Arianna:...<br><br>King: Another wished for some guy who bumped into him to have cancer.<br><br>Arianna:...<br><br>King: So you gonna question why i choose to grant certain wishes or do you want me to continue? Because i got a whole list here"
"2624","Wish",2023-10-10,"I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this. I&#39;m definitely excited to have a real villain again, but I&#39;m also disappointed that we seem to be getting more of the &#39;haha whoops I&#39;m so awkward!&#39; type of humour that&#39;s really starting to get old. Hopefully they&#39;ve just crammed all of those moments into the trailer to grab attention and in the actual film they&#39;re spaced out and more subtle.<br><br>Definitely going to see it, cautiously hoping for good things!"
"2625","Wish",2023-09-27,"I love that the whole film looks like it‚Äôs literally coming from a painting, (very much like how Sleeping Beauty looks) and it also helps that it is filmed in CinemaScope"
"2626","Wish",2023-09-28,"So‚Ä¶ the villain is the guy who wants to make sure wishes are safe for the kingdom?"
"2627","Wish",2023-09-29,"I&#39;m incredibly excited to see this film"
"2628","Wish",2023-10-01,"Very interesting concept for a movie. The King is not wrong in that not everyone should have their wishes granted. While he may be stopping wishes that would undermine his power, there is a good chance that granting all wishes would cause utter chaos. Not to mention if you could just wish for anything, what is even the point of living? A life with no hardships and no challenges would diminish a person&#39;s chance for growth and make all accomplishments meaningless. I get the feeling that the ending will be something like &quot;only those who are truly good or pure of heart will get their wishes granted.&quot; Another option would be &quot;only those who wish on the correct star will have their wishes granted&quot; since maybe there&#39;s only one true wishing star."
"2629","Wish",2023-10-02,"I&#39;m with the king.  People wish for stupid things and they should figure out how to do things for themselves.  Curious how much this one will lose."
"2630","Wish",2023-09-29,"The really made the &#39;villian&quot; the voice of reason"
"2631","Wish",2023-09-28,"Ngl, the trailer doesn‚Äôt really make the king seem too bad? Like, he‚Äôs controlling, but the citizens seem happy. And it‚Äôs definitely a good thing that not everyone‚Äôs wish is granted-"
"2632","Wish",2023-10-24,"The king isn‚Äôt wrong in not granting every wish, in reality it‚Äôs true that not everyone should get what they want. I‚Äôm excited for this movie"
"2633","Wish",2023-09-27,"This looks pretty good and the villain looks like he won‚Äôt be a tragic one which is good we need classic Disney villains back"
"2634","Wish",2023-09-30,"I like how our protagonist already has a clear flaw: she throws caution to the wind without thinking of consequences, it‚Äôs a lesson she has to learn throughout the film<br><br>Edit: I never meant to imply that idealism isn‚Äôt a good thing, just that quick actions can get someone into dangerous situations, it‚Äôs a flaw if it puts her and her people in danger or has the potential to do so"
"2635","Wish",2023-09-28,"I believe her wish is that everyone‚Äôs wish comes true. That‚Äôs why her animal friend started talking. <br><br>I bet some people had horrible wishes that caused chaos to her village and she needed to find a way to undo her wish and save everyone."
"2636","Wish",2023-09-27,"Okay, ngl, this movie looks way more promising than I previously expected, and I love the blended 2D/3D animation style they&#39;re using for this. It looks so clean and fluid and I wouldn&#39;t mind if it was used again in a future Disney film."
"2637","Wish",2023-09-29,"I&#39;m curious to see what actually makes the king a villain. I mean, sure, he&#39;s not exactly nice and is full of himself, but not granting every single wish? I don&#39;t see the problem. Things could get out of control fast if he granted every one"
"2638","Wish",2023-09-30,"Isn&#39;t the villain kinda right tho? You can&#39;t just be granting everyone&#39;s wishes"
"2639","Wish",2023-09-27,"King Magnifico is giving some serious Ursula + Evil Queen + Gaston vibes. That&#39;s how you know he&#39;s going to be a great Disney Villain. Though Asha seems like a carbon copy of Anna, Rapunzel and Moana with the way she speaks and her expressions. <br><br>Edit- The villain sucked and so did the movie."
"2640","Wish",2023-09-27,"This looks so amazingly beautiful, and I would expect nothing less from the film dedicated to Disney‚Äôs centennial!"
"2641","Wish",2023-11-01,"i like relatable characters but sometimes i want to see the characters who make you go, ‚Äúwow, they aren‚Äôt me at all, but that‚Äôs the type of person i want to be.‚Äù"
"2642","Wish",2023-09-27,"This movie better not be a disappointment. Ariana DeBose deserves the world and it makes me so happy that she&#39;s gonna be the next Disney princess."
"2643","Wish",2023-09-27,"This feels very old school Disney with a touch of modern animation in the mix. This looks good and I love the new princess."
"2644","Wish",2023-09-27,"I like that it looks very 2D despite it being a 3D animated movie, and not just because of the art style, but the framing and positions of the characters against the background looks similar to how a lot of 2D animations looks. It&#39;s like 2.5D...<br><br>Some shots almost looked like pictures in a storybook coming to life.<br><br>Edit: I also want to point out how this movie seems to truly be a celebration of Disney as a whole. It&#39;s got the storybook feel of old Disney like Sleeping Beauty. It has animal sidekicks and a (hopefully) interesting and fun villain like the renaissance era, it has the 3D animation and energy of modern Disney, and the music is very modern Disney. All that&#39;s missing is the romance, which has been missing from Disney for far too long"
"2645","Wish",2023-10-02,"I don&#39;t know how the people are in this movie but having everyone&#39;s wishes granted in real life would be an epic disaster. Also, sometimes in life you don&#39;t get what you want but you get what you need. Hope that&#39;s the message this movie conveys."
"2646","Wish",2023-09-27,"I want this to be good so badly. The art looks lovely. The goat is absolutely adorable. It‚Äôs giving old Disney but I‚Äôm afraid of getting too excited."
"2647","Wish",2023-09-27,"Is it wrong to say I already have a crush on King Magnifico? Hearing Chris Pine‚Äôs voice made me more hyped for his movie! Also, Asha is giving me Mirabel and Rapunzel vibes, which I love. Valentino is cute and hilarious."
"2648","Wish",2023-09-28,"I&#39;m actually interested in seeing this. It looks ORIGINAL, for once, and it&#39;s nice to see something that&#39;s not a live-action remake of a perfectly good animated film that doesn&#39;t need to be remade, or a spin-off, prequel or sequel of an existing film. Maybe this can be the film that helps Disney to regain the creativity and brilliance it used to have, because it&#39;s really been in a slump lately!"
"2649","Wish",2023-10-23,"I really miss the old days of romance in a movie. That was fun, especially if done right. I enjoyed Mulan and Shang together, would&#39;ve even loved more scenes of them together in the movie. I also loved Aladdin and Jasmine together in the original movie. I Wish they would go back to that for at least some of their movies, instead of turning away entirely and acting like women who want love are weak lol"
"2650","Wish",2023-11-21,"I wish Disney could go back and make good movies!"
"2651","Wish",2023-09-27,"This film looks like it came from a classic fairy tale book. Now, I came into this world 13 years ago, and I love this type of visuals. I am actually might cry watching this movie. Disney, happy 100 year anniversary!"
"2652","Wish",2023-10-01,"I&#39;m interested to see how this movie deals with wishes. Not every wish can be granted, after all if 2 people have opposing desires, only 1 wish can come true."
"2653","Wish",2023-09-27,"This movie actually looks pretty decent. Asha looks like a good, cute, charming, loveable protagonist and the goat voiced by Alan Tudyk is hilarious. üêê‚ú®üíú"
"2654","Wish",2023-09-27,"I‚Äôm beyond stoked for this one. Asha is gorgeous and seems totally charming, the goat is SO CUTE!!!<br>I hope Asha joins the official Disney Princess lineup, it‚Äôs only fitting the girl from the 100 Anniversary celebration film would be apart of that."

"2657","Wish",2023-09-27,"Oh yes. This is the Disney we missed. A fairy tale feature that involves a protagonist, a comedic animal buddy, and of course, a straight forward villain who is evil! I&#39;m so ready for November."
"2658","Wish",2023-09-28,"I&#39;m 50/50 on it. At least it&#39;s something different, and while it may not revolutionize Disney&#39;s current low standing in Cinema it&#39;s a step in the right direction."
"2659","Wish",2023-09-27,"I love the look of this film. It feels like they&#39;re taking a lot of inspiration from their old 2d films."
"2660","Wish",2023-09-27,"I&#39;m loving so much of what I&#39;m seeing. The hero vs villain story, the painterly computer animation, the music, the Eyvind Earle approach in the forest backgrounds, the voice acting. I&#39;m predicting this to be high up in my Disney Animation ranking! I can&#39;t wait to see it! I love it all so much I would&#39;ve loved to work on it."
"2661","Wish",2023-09-29,"The fact that her name is &quot;Asha&quot; which in my language means &quot;A wish&quot; it just makes it so much better ‚ú®Ô∏è‚úãÔ∏è"
"2662","Wish",2023-09-27,"This reminds me of the classic disney movies. It&#39;s beautiful, funny and magical. It&#39;s a wonderful way to celebrate 100 years of Disney magic"
"2663","Wish",2023-09-28,"Wait, why was the ‚Äòvillain reveal‚Äô for the king the fact that he wasn‚Äôt granting every single wish in the kingdom? That‚Äôs a good idea! Granting every single wish without reviewing them first is a terrible idea!"
"2664","Wish",2023-09-27,"I am so BEYOND excited for this movie to release!!! I went to high school with Ariana and she is so freaking talented. Incredible dancer, singer, actress (triple threat) she always knocked her performances out of the park. It&#39;s so surreal to see her voicing a Disney character now! AHHH!!! I know this is going to be a knock out and it&#39;s refreshing to see a new take/story instead of another remake/live adaptation of an older Disney film."

"2688","Napoleon",2023-07-10,"For Ridley Scott to be in his 80s and still making these energetic epics just showcases that age is truly a number. He, George Miller, and Martin Scorsese still putting out cinematic epics in their older ages."
"2689","Napoleon",2023-07-10,"Such poetic that Joaquin Phoenix plays again the role of an Emperor 23 years later the first time Ridley Scott directed him."
"2690","Napoleon",2023-07-20,"My only concern is, how the hell do you capture a career like Napoleon&#39;s in one movie? Over a period of 25 years, he literally led one of the most interesting lives in history, during one of the most interesting times in history. <br><br>Countless movies and miniseries have focussed on just a few aspects of his life, and the French Revolution that precipitated his rise to power.

"2696","Napoleon",2023-07-16,"The most mind-boggling thing about Buonaparte was he was able to defeat 4 armies in 6 days with an army less than half the size of his foes, and this happened in the twilight period of his career in the Seine valley."
"2697","Napoleon",2023-07-10,"I&#39;m glad there&#39;s still a market for these epic type of films. Especially when it&#39;s done by Ridley Scott."
"2698","Napoleon",2023-07-20,"Fun fact, Napoleon was so good at logistics that during his time in exile on Elba, he oversaw massive infrastructure projects like building new road networks, farms and draining marshes.

"2751","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-07-25,"I LOVE what DC is doing with their superhero movies. Each hero has a different tone and personality, so their movie should reflect that! Batman is dark, Wonder Woman is graceful, Aquaman is badass, Flash is impulsive, Superman is optimistic, and Shazam is childish.<br>..Since a lot of y&#39;all been asking for Black Adam, first of all Black Adam ain&#39;t a superhero. According to the live-action movie, he&#39;s an Anti-hero.  Born as a slave since 2000BC, witnessed violence &amp; death on a regular basis so of course he won&#39;t feel remorse for the villains he has to kill.  So...Black Adam is a ruthless OG!!"

"2812","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-12-17,"Black Adam and Shazam will be a good idea for future DC, indeed, like in the comics. Imho, the good stories are yet to be produced. We must wait for them to come. Meanwhile, I enjoy cartoons (At my age it&#39;s ridiculous, but still- it&#39;s the best show LOL!)"

"2815","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-09-20,"I like how the first movie showed his origin and now he&#39;s actually taking this seriously with an actual team not just doing things solo"
"2816","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-07-23,"Batfleck appearing was the top moment of the trailer for sure"
"2817","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-07-23,"As a marvel fan I have to say this trailer is awesome I cannot wait to watch this movie, DC nailed the first shazam movie and it looks like for the most part most of the original cast is back which is hard enough to do in a sequel marvel should take notice because lately their movies and TV series have not been good. So DC has a great opportunity and if they keep heading in this direction it won&#39;t be long before they overtake marvel."
"2818","Shazam! Fury of the Gods",2022-07-23,"Coming from a Marvel fan, DC is starting to look good actually over the years, Shazam was a fantastic movie, aquaman was good, Joker was incredible, excited for Flash, Batman."

"2832","Saw X",2023-07-30,"‚Äúyou all pretended to cure me, but what I have planned for each of you is VERY real‚Äù gave me chills"
"2833","Saw X",2023-08-11,"I got to meet Tobin Bell at a horror convention in NJ a few years back. He&#39;s one of the absolute sweetest guys I&#39;ve ever met. I was, like, 51, 52, and I was fan-girlling all over the place. So great to see him back in action. The Saw series doesn&#39;t work without him. Very much looking forward to this."
"2834","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Tobin Bell&#39;s voice never fails to send chills, its iconic and low-key scary üò≥"
"2835","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Tobin Bell is one of the best movie villains. His voice itself is enough to send chills üëå"
"2836","Saw X",2023-09-12,"Tobin Bell is one of the greatest horror movie actors and icons of all time. No one can convince me or tell me any different. He&#39;s up there with all the greats."
"2837","Saw X",2023-08-09,"&quot;Live or die, the choice is yours&quot; That line always gives me the chills"
"2838","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This genuinely feels like the old Saw films, and I absolutely love it!"
"2839","Saw X",2023-08-04,"At 80 years old, Tobin Bell is still giving us amazing performances as John Kramer. I&#39;m so happy they&#39;re going back to the roots and setting this right after the first movie. Can&#39;t wait."
"2840","Saw X",2023-08-01,"This feels like a farewell to John and the original series. I‚Äôm so excited! Saw wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without Tobin Bell. He deserves a great send off to the character!"
"2841","Saw X",2023-07-31,"I couldn&#39;t be more excited to see more of Tobin in the spotlight! He truly loves the character and made the role his own."
"2842","Saw X",2023-09-06,"&quot;This is not retribution it&#39;s a re-awakening&quot; Tobin bell is the embodiment of fear when it comes to horror, got nothing but respect for the legend"
"2843","Saw X",2023-07-30,"The amount of stuff the writers are able to make this man do before and after his death is astonishing‚Ä¶"
"2844","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This franchise is picking up its classic vibes again, the darkness, cinematography, lightning and brutality on its peak. Classic Saw vibes."
"2845","Saw X",2023-09-12,"Crazy that the first SAW came out almost 2 decades ago! I remember the ending blew everyone&#39;s mind so bad, definitely a horror classic that will live on for generations!"
"2846","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This feels just like a classic Saw movie. Amanda‚Äôs back, the franchise‚Äôs signature chaotic editing is back, and apparently Hoffman‚Äôs back?? Get me in that theater on Day 1 for this one, PLEASE. I need this movie now."
"2847","Saw X",2023-08-02,"This looks like it was made in 2007. So glad the classic Saw vibe is back. Also Amanda taking the mask off is so cool."
"2848","Saw X",2023-07-30,"No matter how many movies they make, I&#39;ll always watch them. Saw is my favorite horror franchise and I&#39;ll watch it until I die"
"2849","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This truly feels like the franchise is going back to it&#39;s roots and is benefiting from the absolute stunning colour grading and the early 2000s style effects that the older movies had. Really makes me personally feel as though Saw is back!"
"2850","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Who would‚Äôve thought in the 2000‚Äôs we‚Äôd have nostalgia or reminisce of the times we got a Saw movie every Halloween? Looks great &amp; the color grading is perfect."
"2851","Saw X",2023-08-26,"This storyline to bring Tobin back is nothing short of genius. What a time to be alive."
"2852","Saw X",2023-07-30,"‚ÄúHello everyone, it‚Äôs time to play a <b>game</b> .Live or die, the choice is yours‚Äù<br><br>Those lines always sends chills down my spine. Seeing Tobin Bell return to his iconic role is amazing and legendary I‚Äôm very happy this franchise is going back to its roots after Spiral didn‚Äôt do so well. <br><br>This looks absolutely brutal, uncomfortable and fucked up and that‚Äôs how a classic Saw film should be."
"2853","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This really feels like a classic Saw film, from the cinematography to the lighting, and I love it!!!"
"2854","Saw X",2023-09-09,"Tobin Bell has got to be one of the most nicest celebrities anyone could meet. I met him in 2006 at a horror con and he was all over the place shaking hands and taking pics with fans. He mentioned he was in Goodfellas and I went home to rewatch that movie and found him as Robert De Niro‚Äôs parole officer. This man is age less"
"2855","Saw X",2023-07-30,"For the director to go all the way back to make a movie in between 1 -2 &amp; then figure out more twists to fit everything in together. This is a masterpiece"
"2856","Saw X",2023-07-30,"From the cinematography, the style and writing, this feels right at home with the older films and I&#39;m really liking that. Can&#39;t wait to check this out whenever it arrives in theaters."
"2857","Saw X",2023-08-01,"This is one horror franchise that can stand the test of time. You come for the gore and stay for the story, just well executed movies."
"2858","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This looks like it‚Äôs going to be the most insane film in the saw series since the first three films and saw 6 and I am looking forward to it"
"2859","Saw X",2023-08-11,"I seriously love how personal this is, especially that they are focusing on Jigsaw entirely and run his game than being in the background. Tobin is an absolute legend!!! Cant wait!"
"2860","Saw X",2023-09-13,"This actually looks like a movie that is needed in the series and will actually add to the story"
"2861","Saw X",2023-09-25,"Massive respect to Tobin Bell still playing John Kramer at the ripe old age of 80"
"2862","Saw X",2023-08-13,"I NEVER want this series to end"
"2863","Saw X",2023-08-12,"The part after John says ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt retribution, it‚Äôs a reawakening‚Äù, shivers down my spine, the footage alongside that soundtrack is unreal, I really hope we get the Charlie Clouser remix of The Hollies ‚ÄúThe Air that I breathe‚Äù in the soundtrack"
"2864","Saw X",2023-08-01,"No matter what other roles Tobin plays, I will always remember him as Jigsaw! He is perfect as that role. The voice, the terror behind his calm voice. That‚Äôs the scariest part."
"2865","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Glad to see Tobin again. Hopefully he gets as much screen time in this as he did in Saw 2"
"2866","Saw X",2023-08-03,"If this is them rekindling the flame for the saw franchise then I‚Äôm here for it or if this is them doing a proper farewell to Tobin then I‚Äôm here for that too. This looks great and seems to give off vibes of the originals."
"2867","Saw X",2023-08-07,"&quot;This is not retribution, this is a reawakening&quot; - John Kramer ...never gets tiring, the story continues!"
"2868","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Tobin Bell‚Äôs perfect as Jigsaw and I‚Äôm looking forward to this movie! üé•"
"2869","Saw X",2023-07-30,"The classic cinematography, including the aspect ratio. The set design. The gnarlieness. This is a classic SAW movie, I&#39;m all for it."
"2870","Saw X",2023-07-30,"John&#39;s ability to put together so many death traps before he died is astonishing."
"2871","Saw X",2023-08-02,"Blood spurting, guts unraveling, fiendishly lethal inventions, psychological torture and that first ‚ÄúI want to play a game‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äîit never gets old‚Ä¶"
"2872","Saw X",2023-08-04,"I just love how pretty this movie looks with the new HD cameras of the present, while still retaining the classic grimy look of the original films, Im so ready!!!"
"2873","Saw X",2023-07-30,"‚ÄúOf all the men to cheat, you picked John Kramer?‚Äù<br><br>This is what I love about John. The thing is, if his victims knew what he was capable of, they would‚Äôve never messed with him in the first place. On the contrary, they still wouldn‚Äôt have had any problem doing this to other people beside him. That‚Äôs why what he‚Äôs doing is not personal revenge: it‚Äôs justice. If not him, then others less fortunate would‚Äôve payed the price, and John wasn‚Äôt gonna let that happen."
"2874","Saw X",2023-08-02,"I‚Äôll never forget 2004. My brother took me to see the first movie and I was terrified but I loved it. I felt like it was the first time we genuinely bonded as brothers and ever since then it‚Äôs been my all time favorite horror movie series. I actually enjoyed jigsaw and I was a bit disappointed in spiral but props to trying something a bit different. I‚Äôm so happy this movie is coming out because if this is a final goodbye to John Kramer then hopefully it will be a perfect one."
"2875","Saw X",2023-07-30,"I was actually surprised at how good this trailer was! Saw was always a favorite horror movie of mine. I remember watching the first one with my dad late at night and we couldn&#39;t help but stay up to watch it lol. Saw X looks like it&#39;s taking it&#39;s roots back to the older films. I didn&#39;t expect that after 9 sequels."
"2876","Saw X",2023-07-30,"The annual experiences provided by Saw 1-7 back in the day have always been some of my most beloved memories as a horror movie fan. This trailer alone captured every reason why I was such a fan of this story better than the entire 8th and 9th films. Here&#39;s hoping it delivers."
"2877","Saw X",2023-07-30,"Its crazy to see a number 10 in a movie franchise, not to mention it is finally getting back to the best! Can&#39;t wait!"
"2878","Saw X",2023-09-07,"I will NEVER forget how I felt when I watched the end of the first movie. There have been hits and misses in between that movie and this one, but the original remains a classic. Let&#39;s see what this one brings!"
"2879","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This has the classic saw feel and the traps look insanely viscious! Seeing john personally watch over a game is also very interesting and I&#39;m happy to see a movie that focuses primarily on him and not a disciple. Lastly, we saw glimpses of the bathroom game! I hope to cap it all off we also hear zepp10 at the end of the movie! This looks like a true saw movie going back to its roots all these years later and I&#39;m stoked to see it!<br><br>Also I know I&#39;m in the minority here, but while it is cool to see Amanda return I really wish it was Logan helping with this game instead. I know he was in the army at this time but Logan was John&#39;s very first disciple and is the current Jigsaw so I wish to see his backstory as well as him helping John in the past expanded more."
"2880","Saw X",2023-08-03,"This is my favorite series ever, not just in horror. The story is so enthralling and the traps are so intricate and interesting and I love the dillemma between John Kramer being bad for putting them in the traps and the victims themselves being terrible people. I will keep watching these for as long as they come out, no matter how silly, out there, or bad they get."
"2881","Saw X",2023-08-01,"‚ÄúYou all pretended to cure me, but what I have planned for each of you is VERY real‚Äù My favorite quote from the trailer so far."
"2882","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This trailer just dropped half an hour ago and &quot;This is not retribution. It&#39;s reawakening&quot; is already one of the best lines from not just John Kramer, but the whole franchise."
"2883","Saw X",2023-07-30,"The cinematography looks amazing and it really feels like they are going back to their roots. The traps look gruesome and terrifying, the music is so good."
"2884","Saw X",2023-08-01,"So glad Tobin is back he carried the later movies on his back, a true horror legend ‚ù§"
"2885","Saw X",2023-09-22,"I absolutely LOVE the flashes<br>Where it shows the characters smiling, and then flashes to them now, in their traps, facing the consequences of their actions."
"2886","Saw X",2023-09-10,"&quot;The only thing I have not provided is your anaesthetic. But trust me, you will want to remain alert&quot;<br>That was so badass. Can&#39;t wait to see what games in store this time."
"2887","Saw X",2023-07-31,"Usually when a saga is too long it doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ Saw to me is an exception ‚ù§"
"2888","Saw X",2023-07-30,"This looks like it has the potential to be one of the absolute best sequels in the franchise.  I am so ready for this!"
"2889","Saw X",2023-08-04,"I am so beyond pumped it‚Äôs 2023 and we have SAW X releasing. <br><br>I was 14 when the original Saw released, and here I am, going to be 33 when Saw X comes out. <br><br>Bring it ON!!!"
"2890","Saw X",2023-07-30,"The wait is finally over. I nearly shed a tear of joy.<br>The best film series and the best actor and its been too long since his legacy has been continued. Our childhood hero is back"
"2891","Saw X",2023-09-16,"I&#39;ve seen the trailer thousands of times and I still get chills when I hear the doctor say &quot;John Kramer&quot;"
"2892","Saw X",2023-09-28,"Anyone who doesn‚Äôt like saw has never paid attention to the real story. It‚Äôs not about the deaths. It‚Äôs about the reason they are chosen. Such great movies. I can‚Äôt wait to see this one ‚ù§"
"2893","Saw X",2023-07-30,"It&#39;s about time they brought back Bell. Saw 2 waa the best by far and Tobin shined bright. The scene between him and Donnie when he tells him to just sit and talk while he waits for his son is just so good and such a nice twist."
"2894","Saw X",2023-07-30,"I must have watched this trailer 100 times. I dont get excited about movies anymore these days but seeing this brings me back to a time when movies excited me and brought me joy."
"2895","Saw X",2023-07-31,"We‚Äôd all best thank the cast and crew of this movie from top to bottom for not letting the series end on Spiral."
"2896","Air",2023-02-09,"Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Tucker, Jason Bateman, Marlon Wayans and Viola Davis... this has got to be one of the most interesting ensemble cast in recent years!"
"2897","Air",2023-02-10,"As a kid growing up in Chicago in the 90s, this made me a little emotional.  There‚Äôs no one like MJ.  I‚Äôm soooo excited for this ‚ù§"
"2898","Air",2023-02-28,"Wow, what an amazing line: &quot;A shoe is just a shoe.. until my son steps into it.&quot; That&#39;s powerful."
"2899","Air",2023-03-15,"So glad to see Chris Tucker making a comeback, I hope he&#39;s still got his comical ways even though he&#39;s aged since Money Talks and Friday. It&#39;s about time he starred in another movie. Thanks for reading."
"2900","Air",2023-02-09,"Seeing Ben and Matt together in movies together have a different feeling. Ben as a director is definitely a W."
"2901","Air",2023-02-09,"I had the pleasure of seeing MJ live ONCE, and when he was announced it was bigger than any rockstar I have ever seen, I have never heard it that loud in an arena since. It was just insane, then he dropped 50 without much effort"
"2902","Air",2023-02-09,"As a sneakerhead, and MJ fan, this is everything. I&#39;m there üòÅ"
"2903","Air",2023-02-24,"How did they have a trailer about Air Jordans and pursing MJ without ever showing Michael Jordan himself or even an actor playing him. Simply brillant. It&#39;s clearly about the journey it took to land him. I&#39;m all in."
"2904","Air",2023-02-09,"People really don&#39;t realize Jordan&#39;s global impact on sports. Every athlete who came after him is indebted to what he did. GOATs change the world. The word gets thrown around a lot, but they are actually very few of them."
"2905","Air",2023-02-09,"The trailer was awesome. Ben Affleck never disappoints as a director ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"2906","Air",2023-02-14,"The shot of Jordan walking from behind is epic."
"2907","Air",2023-03-21,"If you&#39;re reading this...May all the days of your life be filled with love, health, wealth and unlimited happiness. Many, many blessings‚ù§"
"2908","Air",2023-02-09,"This cast is gonna go places, I can just feel it!"
"2909","Air",2023-02-15,"MJ was bigger than life. In an era with no Internet, smartphones, social media, instant messages and videos, a basketball player was the most popular human on the planet."
"2910","Air",2023-03-29,"I actually watched this movie yesterday at a special premiere and I will say it‚Äôs awesomely mesmerizing."
"2911","Air",2023-02-10,"That&#39;s going to be an absolutely amazing movie. What I&#39;m enjoying even more is how Ben is becoming a legendary director right in front of us."
"2912","Air",2023-02-09,"This looks great! Ben Affleck about to make another classic!"
"2913","Air",2023-02-09,"For someone that&#39;s never watched a single basketball game, I got chills all over my body. Awesome trailer. Hope the movie won&#39;t disappoint."
"2914","Air",2023-02-27,"Ah the 80s and 90s my childhood....the best time to grow up"
"2915","Air",2023-02-09,"This cast is amazing and Ben is such an incredible director. Can‚Äôt wait to see this!"
"2916","Air",2023-02-09,"Affleck is such a darn good director.  I really can&#39;t wait for this.  I&#39;m honestly pretty excited to see Chris Tucker in his role for some reason, too."
"2917","Air",2023-02-10,"Ben Affleck as a director is always on a whole other level"
"2918","Air",2023-02-09,"Ben is genuinely one of the best directors of his era , he can do period , contemporary, thriller , and put out a best picture contender every single time ..gone baby gone , the town , Argo, live by night (yeah I said it live by night lol) and now this ..and remember after Gilli everyone said he would never be able to work in film he was going to start doing tv instead ...I still get chills when I watch him go up to accept the best picture for Argo , a movie I seen with my dad that meant a lot to me so when he won for that and got emotional after everything he had been through I felt so proud and happy for him !"
"2919","Air",2023-03-28,"&quot;Although not directly involved with the film, Michael Jordan met with Ben Affleck prior to the start of production and gave the project his blessing. The casting of Viola Davis was his idea.[12][13] Jordan also requested that Howard White, vice president of Nike‚Äôs Jordan Brand and his personal friend, be included in the film. This directly led to Affleck casting Chris Tucker, with whom he had long wanted to work.&quot;"
"2920","Air",2023-02-09,"Promising director, promising cast, promising trailer. Waiting for this üî•"
"2921","Air",2023-02-09,"WE WILL BE THERE OPENING NIGHT!!!"
"2922","Air",2023-02-13,"I love Micheal Jordan, I was a kid when he changed Basketball forever, but Nike Signing Micheal Jordan is only the 2nd most important event in Nike&#39;s history. How Phil Knight started Nike is the story that needs to be told. He started working for a Japanese running shoe company (Onitsuka - ASICS) that almost NO ONE had heard of in the U.S. and made them a boutique brand in the American market, and tripled their North American sales basically by himself!"
"2923","Air",2023-02-09,"I want another ‚ÄúThe town‚Äù from him. That movie was so freaking good"
"2924","Air",2023-02-10,"Ford vs Ferrari vibes. Matt and Ben together again. Chris tucker. Legendary Jordans. Nothing can go wrong. Already loving this movie"

"2927","Air",2023-02-09,"When I first heard about this movie, it sounded interesting with the premise, cast, and Affleck directing. Definitely going to theater for this"
"2928","Air",2023-02-18,"Can&#39;t wait for the release date. Hope it becomes a success at the box office."
"2929","Air",2023-02-09,"Just got Goosebumps after hearing Matt Damon say the name &quot;Michael Jordan&quot;..."
"2930","Air",2023-03-09,"I&#39;m excited - Matt Damon&#39;s project selection has been pretty good the last few years. And I love these trailer themes."
"2931","Air",2023-02-18,"Looking forward to seeing Ben and Matt working together.  Can this story be strong enough for a full movie!I  Hopefully we see some good 80&#39;s vibes."

"2933","Air",2023-02-09,"Jordan is the reason why I love basketball and I&#39;m huge Marlon Wayans fan.  Amazing cast and Ben Affleck directing makes me more excited to watch."
"2934","Air",2023-02-09,"What an amazing trailer! You knew even before his name was mentioned that it was building up to MJ!"
"2935","Air",2023-03-28,"When you‚Äôre life is centered on watching the Bulls and Michael being drafted into NBA and watching that Bulls Dynasty flourish and thrive. Remembering LIVE when Jordan kissed the trophy after winning it.  Remembering all that time frame and I LIVED thru it (I‚Äôm 55). This movie is A MUST SEE for me. From college to his last game I‚Äôve been a Jordan fan. Just BLESSED I got to see HIM PLAY LIVE before he retired 2 times in United Center!  BLESSED as he became a player on MY team at the time The Chicago Bulls as I lived 45 minutes south of the city of Chicago.  Yes THIS is a personal movie for me AND CANT wait to see it. Love that I will be able, thru Ben and Matt, be brought back to my fondest memories in the past and live thru it one more time!!  I can‚Äôt say YESSS!! LET‚ÄôS GO!!! Any more than I have!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"

"2966","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-21,"I&#39;m so excited about this movie! Praying that God will spark a new revival among this generation of young people!"
"2967","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-20,"I was there at the very beginning of the Hippie Jesus Movement in March/April 1969 in Santa Ana, CA! We attended Calvary Chapel with Pastor Chuck Smith. It was awesome! Jesus is my life. Everyone needs Jesus, especially those who don&#39;t think they do!"
"2968","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-24,"Jesus is still doing miracles. He saved me from suicide and gave me meaning and hope in my darkest of valleys. He is alive and can turn any life into something precious and above all He loves you.<br><br>God bless and thanks for reading."
"2969","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-28,"In 1973 my wife&#39;s sister kept bugging her to come to a tent in a bean field in Costa Mesa to hear a preacher named Chuck teach the bible and hear some Christian rock/folk music. When the band played she recognized them: it was the Road Home and she had danced to their music at a nightclub in Newport Beach previously. She was shocked to see them in this tent. She was a cocktail waitress at the Red Onion restaurant in Palos Verdes at that time and we were dating. When she told me she got &quot;born again&quot; that night in the tent I was blindsided because she was somewhat of a hellraiser and the change was a dramatic 180 degrees. We got married and spent the next 39 years learning the gospel from Pastor Chuck until his very last time in the pulpit in 2013."
"2970","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-18,"My heart is singing! I was one of those Jesus Hippies/Jesus Freaks that was changed by the love &amp; power of Jesus through His Holy Spirit! I gave my life to Him over 50 years ago when I was just 18 yrs old and looking for the answers in life. Andre Crouch had a song that said it all! &quot;JESUS IS THE ANSWER&quot;! STILL A JESUS FREAK even in my old age! He saves and keeps us!!!! üòáüôåüôåüôåüôå"
"2971","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-26,"I want more movies based on Christian stories or testimonies because there is nothing more encouraging than knowing how God has worked in other peoples lives and there are so many incredible testimonies out there!!"
"2972","Jesus Revolution",2022-11-28,"I got to watch this movie yesterday, a surprise early preview. It is absolutely incredible! It definitely speaks to our generation today, and it‚Äôs very similar to how I believe we need to be reaching out to the new age group. They are eagerly searching for love, and for truth, just in all the wrong places. Come, Lord Jesus, come!"
"2973","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-21,"I was born again in Chucks church. I‚Äôm so grateful for him opening those doors to all! My husband was saved when he listened to a Greg Laurie cassette tape. Looks like the film did it justice!! Can‚Äôt wait to see it."
"2974","Jesus Revolution",2022-11-29,"Oh my!!!!! My dad worked for Chuck Smith and God used him as my mentor the first decade of my life and Greg Laurie is such a beloved part of the Body at our Calvary Chapel, I&#39;m so unbelievably psyched that this testimony is being released! Glory to God! I pray all the time for church to come back to beaches and His love to spread throughout the cities like wildfire! Let no believer be ashamed of the name of Jesus!!!!!!!! Let Hallelujahs ring!"
"2975","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-21,"It&#39;s awesome that they cast Jonathan Roumie in this."
"2976","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-14,"This is the second time watching this trailer. The first time was maybe an hour ago. I tear up each time. This is soooooo amazing.

"2978","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-19,"Thank you for this! We need movies with Christ and a positive message more than ever hear days. Watching interviews where Kelsey Grammer tears up just talking about this movie brings me to tears myself. For someone to be so touched by the lord! Share with everyone!"
"2979","Jesus Revolution",2022-12-28,"I am an atheist, and I found that trailer very moving and life affirming. The idea of people coming together and overcoming differences is something that the world could use a LOT more of! :)"
"2980","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-21,"Wow, this looks absolutely amazing! Who else laughed out loud when they opened the door to find &quot;Jesus&quot; from The Chosen saying, &quot;This house has a very good viiiibe!&quot;? üòÇüòÇ Can&#39;t wait to see the movie!"

"2983","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-20,"Jesus healed me of stomach ulcers in a matter of about 10 seconds and healed my back (in 2 places) in about the same amount of time on a different occasion. He restored my self worth, the list is endless. He&#39;s the same yesterday, today and forever. There&#39;s nobody like Jesus Christ. He&#39;s rightly named Lord and Savior!"

"2987","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-23,"I remember the Jesus movement in the late 60s early 70s so well!  We were called Jesus Freaks.  My sister taught me a song that she learned at the time, and when I sang it, I was born again."
"2988","Jesus Revolution",2022-11-11,"Raised in Huntington Beach and a neighbor took my sisters and I (I was 9 or 10) to the Big Tent and we sat on the ground up front. I remember the music and the crowds. A couple years later a neighbor boy led me to Christ in his driveway after shooting hoops. What a time it was!  That shot of the actress playing Greg‚Äôs future wife smiling through the fence makes you feel young again. So sweet!"
"2989","Jesus Revolution",2023-01-14,"Cannot wait, love the cast, lived the time and knew the players.  Been a Jesus lovin hippie freak for over 50 years and never looked backed.  I am so grateful for the people who poured into me.  I hope to pay back at as many sean feught &quot;Let Us worships&quot; I can get to this year.  MAKE JESUS #1 AT THE THEATRE. MAKE HISTORY AGAIN AS WE NEED A REVIVAL."
"2990","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-16,"Although the journey has at times been rough, I have been a devoted follower of Jesus for a bit over 27 years. Pastor Chuck (I miss you so much), Pastor Raul Reis &amp; Pastor Greg Laurie have been my radio/internet guides all through those years. I am nowhere near where I want to be in my walk with Jesus. Someday I hope to attend services in their beloved churches and hear them speak in person- Pastor Brodersen as well. I know the story and have heard it numerous times. Watching the trailer &amp; seeing it presented in movie format is going to be special. I can feel the tears already. This is going to awesome! Thank You Lord!"
"2991","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-15,"Jonathan Roumie deserves to be listed in title as well. Great actor and plays Jesus on The Chosen and does an amazing job. Give him his due."
"2992","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-23,"Pastor Chuck had a huge impact on my life spiritually as a very young Christian believer in Jesus. As a young Army officer stationed on the DMZ in Korea in 1977, me and two other soldiers used to sit and listen to Chuck&#39;s bible teachings on cassette tapes.  He was and still is a mentor to me in and through his books, teachings and through &quot;The Word for Today Bible&quot;.  I thank God for the ministry of Pastor Chuck Smith.  What a blessing he was to so many.  Moreover I loved Maranatha Music and all of the early Christian music scene...Bethlehem, Mustard Seed Faith, Chuck Girard and so many more.  I look forward to seeing this movie; it looks great from the trailer."

"3007","Jesus Revolution",2022-10-24,"What an amazing time. I was 10 years old when I accepted Christ.  It was at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa. Does anyone remember the different bands playing there like Love Song. Also, when we moved from the little chapel to the Big Tent. The nights would get so cold but that didn&#39;t stop any one from coming to worship and praise God."
"3008","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-17,"My dad, may he rest in peace, always talked about this movement. He was a wild hippie and found God and knew Chuck and Lonnie, Chuck ordained my parents marriage. When my dad first went to the Calvary church, he brought candy and coke and was treating it like a show lol üòÇ"
"3009","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-15,"Our country is still a dark and divided place that still needs Jesus. A lot of great Christian music came out of this movement--new updated Christian music that drew people to Jesus Christ."
"3010","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-17,"Something that‚Äôs not lost on me. Jesus said ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock.‚Äù And here they have Jesus from the Chosen knocking to let Jesus into his church."
"3011","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-23,"I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS MOVIE<br>it made me cry and loved me so much. I pray for this Jesus Revolution to happen once again Lord today right now. May we all realize today that it‚Äôs really YOU were all searching for Lord. üíú"

"3015","Jesus Revolution",2023-02-20,"This movement had a giant impact on my life.  After growing up in a church that didn&#39;t really preach the Bible, someone opened the scriptures for me, and I met Jesus in 1971.  For almost 30 years I wandered from church to church, never finding one that exactly followed the Bible as I had come to understand it after receiving Christ.  Then in 2000, I was invited to Calvary Chapel by one of their pastors.  What Calvary was teaching was exactly what I believed and was searching for.  Today, I am one of three elders in a small Calvary Chapel fellowship in rural Utah.  I can&#39;t wait to see this picture.  However, because of the dominance of the regional religion, it won&#39;t be shown locally.  I&#39;ll either be making a long drive or waiting for the video release.  But still, I can&#39;t wait."

"3054","No Hard Feelings",2023-05-07,"I‚Äôve rewatched this trailer for like 17x already and I‚Äôm still laughing üòÇü§£ü§£"
"3055","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"Can&#39;t believe Jennifer Lawrence is doing comedy, she&#39;s so funny it&#39;s feels like she is not acting at all. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this movie"
"3056","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"I‚Äôm so incredibly proud of Andrew - this looks so good!"
"3057","No Hard Feelings",2023-04-03,"It&#39;s the facial expressions, she is such a funny actress, love how goofy she is an she knows n owns it üñ§ &quot;WHHHYYYYYYYY&quot; ü§£"
"3058","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-11,"Lol I thought this was gonna be stupid but it looks pretty decent. Love Jennifer and seeing her in a comedy is a relief after all these years!"
"3059","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"This is seriously so funny!!! Jennifer is a natural at comedy! Great Writing!"
"3060","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-13,"It almost feels like an 80s comedy. Definitely will check it out"
"3061","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"The pepper spray scene got me rolling!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"3062","No Hard Feelings",2023-05-22,"The boy seems to be dedicated and focused on what he wants to do with his life. He is smart and ambitious so what reason is there to fix him when he is perfect and ideal in every way. This is the person that society expects us to be. Serious and commuted to doing what is important. To be honest my parents would wish for me to be that types of person"
"3063","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-11,"Never thought a movie like this could still be made nowadays. Pleasantly surprised ü§ò"
"3064","No Hard Feelings",2023-04-26,"This honestly feels like a breathe of fresh air,sick and tired of reboots,remakes,or connected universe&#39;s."
"3065","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-31,"I&#39;ve seen this trailer like 4 times and every time it gets me.. this trailer is like a mini movie!! Jennifer Lawrence is awesome!!  I can&#39;t wait to see the whole movie!! XD"
"3066","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-10,"My favourite Jennifer Lawrence performances have been the ones with some humour like Silver Linings Playbook and she‚Äôs funny in interviews so her getting to do a classic comedy is so exciting"
"3067","No Hard Feelings",2023-04-25,"That punch to the throat really did it for me ü§£ü§£"
"3068","No Hard Feelings",2023-06-08,"This is one I may actually pay for in theatres. I need this type of comedy in my life, give the viewers what they want! Tha I God Jennifer picked up a comedy role, she was obviously waiting until she found a script that was funny enough"
"3069","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"Finally a movie with Jennifer Lawrence that I actually want to go seeü§£"
"3070","No Hard Feelings",2023-05-17,"I will show this trailer to my parents to tell them what they missed in my upbringing"
"3071","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-10,"I always thought she could do more comedic movies as she&#39;s naturally funny in person"
"3072","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"Perfect movie for Jennifer to showcase her comedic side. And this looks good. I hope the main leads become friends in the end. The romantic route is a generic direction for me."
"3073","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"I cant believe this is the first time in a LONG time a trailer genuinely had me laughing so hard! This is worth going to the movie theaters for!"
"3074","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"To be honest, knowing she&#39;s naturally funny. Her role is just like Jennifer Lawrence playing Jennifer Lawrence and I&#39;m all here for that. ü§£"
"3075","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"A return to comedy like Knocked Up and American Pie - love it!"
"3076","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-19,"I missed movies like this. 2000s were full of them. I&#39;ll take it over any Marvel movie any day"

"3078","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-15,"This is the biggest case of double standard I‚Äôve ever seen. This trailer made me feel like I needed a shower afterwards."
"3079","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"This looks like a classic comedy so I‚Äôm exited just to have fun"
"3080","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-11,"YASSS !!!! This is the type of movie I wanna watch &amp; it‚Äôs so refreshing to see Jennifer Lawrence in it instead of some pretentious art movie. I don‚Äôt know why Jennifer Lawrence doesn‚Äôt dabble more into the comedy genre. She‚Äôs fabulous in it."
"3081","No Hard Feelings",2023-04-03,"Yes, this I want to see. Crazy shenanigans, and fun. Just like movies used to be. ü§©"
"3082","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-15,"Jennifer Lawrence is the first woman to ever be cast in a movie. Such a trailblazer."

"3086","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-12,"I didnt think I&#39;d live long enough to see Jennifer Lawrence turn into Amy Schumer."
"3087","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"Can‚Äôt believe a trailer made me laugh this much üòÇ"
"3088","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-09,"This movie is going to be iconic."
"3089","No Hard Feelings",2023-04-02,"Finally, Jennifer Lawrence playing herself in a role!"
"3090","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-26,"Wow! An actual R rated comedy that looks like they used to look. <br><br>I will be there opening weekend!"
"3091","No Hard Feelings",2023-03-10,"This had me cracking up. Theres been few movies lately that actually make me laugh. Just the previews alone were enough to. Looking forward to this!ü§£üëç"
"3092","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"AYEEEEE!! Can&#39;t believe this is happening!!"
"3093","Talk to Me",2023-04-12,"Whoever is running A24, I can&#39;t thank you enough for all the great movies you distribute. Basically a blueprint in how to run a distribution company and a lesson to all others that you have to have an identity and a soul so people can relate to, like, and trust you to give them quality every time."
"3094","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"As someone who&#39;s been watching RackaRacka since childhood, this is putting a huge smile on my face to see how far they come. They were making funny videos with Ronald McDonald, now they&#39;re making a full on horror film. I am so flipping proud of these two and I cannot wait to see what this has in store."
"3095","Talk to Me",2023-04-16,"A24 has some of the best original horror stories. They seem like they have requirements for directors to be original,because everything they put out feels fresh."
"3096","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"I‚Äôve been following the directors‚Äô journey since elementary school, as someone who did YT for a while and transitioned into filmmaking, it‚Äôs amazing to see this. Phenomenal work y‚Äôall üôåüèæ"
"3097","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"SOMEONE SAVE THAT DOG"
"3098","Talk to Me",2023-04-13,"It really is a great time for the horror genre.  It‚Äôs nice to see smart drama/horror films getting the respect and interest they deserve."
"3099","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"I remember hearing that RackaRacka wanted to get into filmmaking and I never EVER imagined them getting to this level so quickly. I‚Äôm glad their talent was able to shine through and they‚Äôre getting the recognition they deserve. This is gonna be one to remember"
"3100","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"So proud of Danny and Michael, saw this movie last year and it was a blast! It&#39;s a must see in cinemas!"
"3101","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"This trailer looks intense and really shows what horror and addiction is. I hope the movie turns out awesome. So happy for the brothers!"
"3102","Talk to Me",2023-04-13,"A24! BRING IT AGAIN!!! This studio... one hell of a track record. It&#39;s truly incredible how many great films they&#39;ve put out. It&#39;s like a list of Criterion worthy movies down the line."
"3103","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Was waiting for more A24 horror.  They literally never miss.  Can&#39;t wait."
"3104","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"I was at the screening for this at Overlook Film Festival.  It was the Secret Centerpiece Screening there, and it&#39;s one hell of a ride!  Trust me, you guys are NOT ready for this one!"
"3105","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"So fucking happy for Danny and Michael. All these years of work and dedication are paying off. It is fabulous to see"
"3106","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Australia represent!! so proud of how far Danny and Michael have come, cant wait to see this one!"
"3107","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"This is surreal, the fact you guys went from Ronald McDonald beefs to a whole life A24 movie is insane, so proud of rackaracka"
"3108","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Been following the racka boys for ages. Proud of them making a big movie and it getting picked up by A24 at Sundance is so huge. This looks insane so keen"
"3109","Talk to Me",2023-04-23,"A24 sure is one of a kind. Talk To Me isn‚Äôt your generic horror film. It actually has real substance in terms of its plot and characters. We can see here how the psychological aspect to it takes center stage."
"3110","Talk to Me",2023-07-12,"A24 is ran by some absolute legends. The movies they select  are very intriguing. Will be hitting the theatre for this."
"3111","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"It&#39;s amazing to think that 2 crazy brothers have now made a film I&#39;m very exited to see. The imagery already looks great! Can&#39;t wait for July!"
"3112","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Awesome to see filmmakers start on YouTube and then literally go to the biggest indie film company. Major respect raka twins."
"3113","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"A24 is on another level. No studio is touching them yet"
"3114","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"I can not even begin to describe my excitement for this movie, I know and have worked with a few of the actors and crew and have been hearing about it all for months!! I‚Äôm so ready to see this in theatres ‚ù§‚ù§"
"3115","Talk to Me",2023-04-12,"I‚Äôm V glad they put the dog out. No need for doggo to be part of their spooky shenanigans"
"3116","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"It&#39;s nice to be part of a moment of cinematic history like this"
"3117","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"forever in love with A24 for pumping out stuff like this"
"3118","Talk to Me",2023-06-06,"Was lucky enough to see this flick in New Orleans last March as part of the Overlook Film Festival - it was the Secret Centerpiece screening. Believe the hype for this one, and don&#39;t miss the chance to see it in theaters this summer. Not just a great horror movie, but a great movie that happens to be horror."
"3119","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"With all the releases from A24, they solidifying that they are the best production studio out there right now."
"3120","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"This is the best horror movie I&#39;ve seen in ages, you&#39;re all in for a ride"
"3121","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Amazing work boys!!! These 2 deserve all the praise and hype they get. Let&#39;s get around them!"
"3122","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Been watching RackaRacka for years so this feels like an accomplishment for me in itself. Hurry up Lee we want to watch! LFG Danny and Michael, you guys are killing it."
"3123","Talk to Me",2023-04-15,"Now that was a trailer! No jump scares and not too much revealed. Just creepy suspense"
"3124","Talk to Me",2023-04-16,"I freaking LOVE Sophie Wilde! That‚Äôs a lit role üî•üî•üî• A24. Must See. Anxious!!!"
"3125","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Good to finally see some Aussies given a bit of international recognition! Danny and Michael leading the way!"
"3126","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"A24 should be recognized  all over the world"
"3127","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Let&#39;s go boys. Come a long way from WWE wrestling in your backyard, to your first ever feature film getting picked up by A24. Congrats Michael and Danny, so excited for this film, and your ever bright future."
"3128","Talk to Me",2023-04-13,"Im very proud rackaracka a year later finding out about your upload i bursted into tears watching you guys make the horror movie not only have you two been making videos together as young kids aspiring to be filmmakers one day going to the sundance film festival vowed by a lovely family figure but now are attempting to direct an unique horror film in the shape of something symbolic fitting the interscope of A24 logo using it as a plot device in a horror movie i cannot wait to see this &amp; will be going in with high expectations after following your passionate careers for a very long time &amp; the reception major director&#39;s have given you guys."
"3129","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"Glad I watched the premier at her majesty&#39;s theatre. One of the best movies ever! Also loved that you put a soundtrack by Sadistik! One of the most underrated rappers."
"3130","Talk to Me",2023-07-18,"Just saw an advanced screening of this in NZ, I&#39;m not much of a horror fan but it was really great, plus original. And it&#39;s the first film for these directors. I&#39;m sure the films lead, Sophie Wild, will soon be very famous."
"3131","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"So good üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
"3132","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"A24 is the studio we so badly needed"
"3133","Talk to Me",2023-07-27,"Man &quot;Talk to me&quot; was my favourite dirty talk phrase... Now I gotta worry about ghosts and sh!t."
"3134","Talk to Me",2023-04-12,"I&#39;ve heard amazing things about this film for months! Really glad A24 picked it up"
"3135","Talk to Me",2023-04-16,"The words ‚ÄúA24‚Äù and ‚Äúdemonic horror‚Äù are instantly terrifying. I literally just got over hereditary and that came out 5 years ago. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready yet. üòÖ"
"3136","Talk to Me",2023-04-20,"This was the best film I saw at Sundance. It‚Äôs one of the best horror films in years."
"3137","Talk to Me",2023-04-19,"Goosebumps when Danny and Michael‚Äôs names came up üò≠"
"3138","Talk to Me",2023-04-18,"I saw this movie at the Berlinale and it was one of the best movies in the horror genre! Really dark and twisting!"
"3139","Talk to Me",2023-04-11,"I don&#39;t care if everyone dies, as long as the dog is ok"
"3140","Talk to Me",2023-04-20,"YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! One of the best horror films ive ever had the pleasure of seeing. Its brutal and tense and amazingly acted."
"3141","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us,&quot; followed by the roar was absolutely bone-chilling."
"3142","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I like how Toho is modernising the franchise without losing their style or identity."
"3143","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"It‚Äôs always refreshing to see Godzilla return to his villain role every once in a while. And the fact that this movie is set right after Japan loses WW2."
"3144","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Looks incredible ! I love the way they show Godzilla isn&#39;t just walking around, he destroyes EVERYTHING."
"3145","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"you know you are doing great with a character, when even 69 Years later it still gives goosebumps generation after generation"
"3146","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"My favorite part of this whole trailer is how they managed to implement the impact that godzilla inflicts to the city by just walking! Like the ground breaks with every step"
"3147","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster...will never forgive us&quot;<br>That line sent chills. I like that."
"3148","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"The idea of Godzilla holding a grudge against an entire country, then waiting for them to be at their weakest before striking at them again is... It&#39;s actually really chilling."
"3149","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Love this moment when Godzilla took a step and the ground was pushed up. Stunning."
"3150","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"It really feels like a modern proper remake of 54. The roar, the atmosphere, the destruction. What a time to be a Godzilla fan"
"3151","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"It&#39;s nice to see Godzilla treated as a horror monster instead of just an action hero"
"3152","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"‚ÄúThat monster‚Ä¶will never forgive us.‚Äù I love that line. This movie is gonna be great"
"3153","Godzilla Minus One",2023-11-03,"I love that you can feel the overwhelming power of Godzilla, even the apocalyptic theme returning to Godzilla&#39;s original message."
"3154","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"Can we just applaud Takashi Yamazaki? This man directed, wrote, and did the VFX of this movie. Even if this movie someway, somehow manages to fail, you gotta give this man props."
"3155","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I think the most amazing aspect is that we see people&#39;s deaths. We don&#39;t watch Godzilla walk through city streets from an eagle-eye view, we&#39;re on the ground as Godzilla tears through buildings and people are flung into the air or crushed. The human suffering is always hidden away, which will make this movie truly horrifying and real."
"3156","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-10,"people tend to forget the the original Gojira was intended as a horror movie, aimed at the horrors of nuclear weapons and war, i love how this brings him back to that root and makes him terrifying<br><br>also that roar is just..."
"3157","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster‚Ä¶ will never forgive us.&quot; As it cuts to Godzilla‚Äôs roar sends chills up my spine. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters. This looks amazing!"
"3158","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-07,"Godzilla has always been a fascinating paradox. He is a character with the dichotomy of being either a destructive monster and a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power, or a comic book superhero and defender of Earth, as well as a symbol of Japanese national pride."
"3159","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"Although I‚Äôm used to Godzilla being the protagonist, this classic antagonistic Godzilla has me screaming out of joy, never been so satisfied with the glory and beauty of such an iconic figure"
"3160","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"As a 32 year old who&#39;s loved Godzilla my whole life... this is everything!"
"3161","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; confrims that this is exactly the kind of Godzilla story I love."
"3162","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"For someone that has been a Godzilla fan since childhood this is what I have always wanted: a modern remake of the original with all its themes and commentary intact."
"3163","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-08,"That classic roar sent chills down my spine‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the first time a Godzilla roar actually sounded ominously frightening!"
"3164","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"the way Godzilla is breaking the ground by stepping shows he&#39;s not messing around and i love it"
"3165","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-06,"No matter what the form of Godzilla, no matter what the series.......Godzilla always gives me the chills."
"3166","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I&#39;m all for Godzilla being the hero, but I sure do love his roots and what he&#39;s meant to be portrayed as, a monster beyond the comprehension of men, a metaphor for destruction and outcome of war, except Godzilla is the personification of that. Just seeing this trailer gave me chills. I&#39;m so pumped for this movie."
"3167","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"From the looks of this trailer I think it‚Äôs really cool how much emphasis they‚Äôre putting on the devastation Godzilla causes to humanity. Not like it hasn‚Äôt been done in previous entries but to see the emotion the impact, the actual destruction of Japan in a perspective like this hasn‚Äôt  been done in a while"
"3168","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"The design for Godzilla is amazing considering it seems to be paying homage to what inspired his original design to begin with. Scarred, radiation-burnt flesh to signify the way he was created."
"3169","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I‚Äôm 68 years old, I have loved Godzilla since the first one came out way back in the day! I‚Äôve already told my daughter that I want to see this movie as my Christmas present!"
"3170","Godzilla Minus One",2023-10-14,"&quot;That monster... will never forgive us&quot; Is such a great line"
"3171","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;From Zero to Minus&quot; is very impactful. To face this terror post-war for Japan would be devastating"
"3172","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; This line got me hyped especially if it means what I think it means. Godzilla being both a force of destruction and an actual character with goals and personality, the last where we see him completly scared made me hopeful we will dive into his tragic backstory too."
"3173","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-06,"Godzilla has to be the only cinema character were they can keep making movies about him and we never get bored of him. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!"
"3174","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"This movie looks incredible. Godzilla is CGI but still looks real and horrifying. I like how the destruction is shown, from the perspective of humans, being crushed, falling off buildings and getting stepped on, and I‚Äôm excited to see how they‚Äôll do the scenes with battleships! I‚Äôm unbelievably hyped for this film!"
"3175","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"You can tell that this will be gory and brutal, since you hardly see people get directly killed by Godzilla, save for a handful of movies."
"3176","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"Even after nearly 70 years! They still bring the king of the monsters back to the screens! Let‚Äôs go Godzilla minus one!"
"3177","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Props to Toho for bringing this to American theaters one month after Japan&#39;s premiere.<br>I recall wondering when I&#39;d get the chance to see Final Wars in theaters, back in 04/05."
"3178","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-11,"I love the dichotomy between toho Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla in how they are both pictured as forces of nature... makes me all the more excited for this movie. <br>Legendary Godzilla is a hurricane, he doesnt care about humanity unless humanity is directly involving themselves in his business. Hes just there to do his job and defend his home<br>Toho Godzilla is like a man-made disaster, what happens when you poke at earth too much and earth pokes back. Hes directly targeting humans in retaliation. <br><br>Its two very different tones for the exact same character and we get to see both at the same time via different studios (given Monarch: Legacy of monsters will be releasing a month before this)"
"3179","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"There&#39;s so much inspiration going on in this trailer. Im getting 1954 vibes, Shin vibes, and even Legendary vibes. This movie really looks like its going to be the great film."
"3180","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot;<br><br>Absolute chills."
"3181","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-11,"The roar gives me chills. I love how it‚Äôs more of a horror film, it makes Godzilla look more of a threat. Looks incredible."
"3182","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-06,"Yes, this is Godzilla done right. You really get the feel for the magnitude of the raw power and destruction that is Godzilla.  I‚Äôm 53 yo woman and remember watching Godzilla on TV with my father. This trailer has such a nostalgic feel to it for me, because it takes the threat that is Godzilla so seriously and it makes you feel  for the people of Japan."
"3183","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"This looks epic. What a time to be alive. Classic Toho style Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla stories at the same time. We are truly blessed by Godzilla."
"3184","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-09,"‚ÄúFrom Zero to Minus‚Äù<br><br>There‚Äôs something horrifying about this concept. This is gonna be something special"
"3185","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Looks incredible, I got chills. I love how it goes back to the original idea of Godzilla and what it represented post WW2"
"3186","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"This is the Godzilla movie we always needed. Set in Japan and produced by Toho Studios but with cutting edge VFX effects of the Hollywood versions."
"3187","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-06,"I love that they kept the original &#39;54 roar. That one in particular had a profound effect that meshed so well with the original movie. The other roars from King Kong vs Godzilla onward sort of deceased his fear factor despite of it being so iconic. And that was the first roar I heard! When I heard him roar for the first time in the 1954 classic, I was really taken a back because it wasn&#39;t the roar that I was used to. That one was much darker and terrifying than what I heard previously as a kid. The fact that they only used it when it called for it was a great effect, and it didn&#39;t overstay it&#39;s welcome. The terror and bone-chilling feeling of that roar combined with the actions of a horrific monster of gargantuan heights makes me think this is definitely trying to go back to Godzilla&#39;s roots in the most definitive, authentic way possible. Everything else with the setting, the design, the story; it seems this time Godzilla is going to be dark. Way more darker and sinister than he&#39;s ever been. I can&#39;t wait for December 1st"
"3188","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"I like the idea of Godzilla being destructive simply by walking around. The other movies haven‚Äôt really done a good job of explaining what his tail does and why his footsteps don‚Äôt cause hell on its own"
"3189","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"peak has arrived"
"3190","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I don‚Äôt normally see movies with subtitles in theaters‚Ä¶ but when I do, it‚Äôs GODZILLA! üî• LET‚ÄôS GOOOOOO!!!"
"3191","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"Haven&#39;t been this excited for a movie since Shin.<br>This looks like it&#39;s going to be an amazing return to form, updated with modern tech and  a much more brutal take.<br><br>Also, I love that shot of the ship flying into a destroyed building. The effects and camerawork are stunning!"
"3192","Godzilla Minus One",2023-10-08,"Not that there is ever a bad time to be a Godzilla fan, but oh my goodness what a time to be a Godzilla fan. <br><br>Godzilla will outlive us all."
"3193","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=82"">1:22</a><br>Particularly this shot. Everything in this is incredibly harrowing, but seeing Godzilla himself horrifically burnt and scarred is something else. A force of nature, almost crippled, presumably from nuclear attack, is terrifying in itself. <br>this movie is going to swim in dark tones and themes, but that was not something i was expecting"
"3194","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"The design feels like a mix between Heisei and Legendary. I absolutely love it."
"3195","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I love how this feels like a 50&#39;s era movie, and having Godzilla as an evil force of nature that brings rampage, despair and destruction to the land feels so good man, that&#39;s how he started, and honestly, I prefer him that way"
"3196","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Godzilla sure is menacing. The fact that Japan has been increasingly popular with their movie releases these days is just plain outstanding to me. We‚Äôve seen Hollywood make remakes, but with the Japanese entertainment industry, they‚Äôre taking things next level."
"3197","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-08,"This is true Godzilla. Full circle. The classic returns. Godzilla won movies. It is astronomically impossible to explain how existentialy exited i feel for this. This is perfection."
"3198","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"WOW. These VFX are stunning. Particularly the physics, weight and power of everything. In particular that ship at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=66"">1:06</a>. Geeked."
"3199","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot; That hits so hard."
"3200","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"The aspect of Japan being destroyed after World War II immediately caught my attention. It seems toho is not just making Godzilla a horror monster again, but is also being back the tragedy and loss. Something we truest have not had since the original movie."
"3201","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-06,"Im glad TOHO decided to reboot the series again. Shin was fantastic, but really could only stand on its own. This seems to be a return to form for the franchise."
"3202","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-07,"Godzilla feels like a force of nature that is both the consequences of the atomic bomb and also the natural disasters that always hits Japan like earthquakes and tsunamis. It&#39;s well known that Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Now, this movie seems to be going back to his destructive roots as the wrath of nature since uranium and plutonium the main ingredients for nuclear bombs are both found in nature only to be transformed into a weapon by humans as shown in the Oppenheimer movie."
"3203","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"This might be the scariest Godzilla movie ever made. Godzilla looks really awesome, and the destruction scenes look great."
"3204","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I think this is probably gonna be one of, if not THE most gruesome Godzilla movie of the entire franchise. You hardly see anyone getting injured in the old films, but in this trailer alone, you can easily spot like 30+ people just getting wrecked by the damage. It&#39;s insane. Also LOVE a new adaptation of Godzilla being a bad guy again. No crazy fights or anything supernatural or lore with other unique monsters. Just classic Godzilla causing ruthless chaos and destruction. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
"3205","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I love seeing this return to form for Godzilla. Pure hatred, pure vengeance. A wild animal lashing out in rage at all of humanity for the horrors of war."
"3206","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I really hope this is as good as it looks. The music, the clips, the desperation in the quote ‚ÄúThat monster will never forgive us.‚Äù The implied, defeated spirit of the man being scorned: ‚ÄúEveryone is dead-‚Äú ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a disgrace!‚Äù To the stubborn will to carry on; ‚Äúfight and survive.‚Äù And, the undeniable imagery of Godzilla‚Äôs disastrous rise paralleling the atomic devastation of Japan. It legit tears me up."
"3207","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"I love how this Godzilla is basically like a vengeful force of nature that seems to have an actual grudge against Japan instead of the gorilla fighting lizard hero. Kinda cool seeing him in a different light"
"3208","Godzilla Minus One",2023-10-07,"This looks exactly like the Godzilla movie I&#39;ve always wanted. I try not to get too excited for movies these days since so many are disappointing, but I can&#39;t help but be excited for this. Now please don&#39;t give too much away in endless trailers, let&#39;s keep some spectacle for the actual movie!"
"3209","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Seeing this on number 2 on trending with the most views within 15 hours makes me and a whole lot of Godzilla fans happy I bet"
"3210","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"If we can‚Äôt get a Shin Godzilla sequel, this is easily the next best thing"
"3211","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-08,"The way they made Gojira 1954s roar sound so menacing even now is insane."
"3212","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-26,"I love how this film looks like it&#39;s come full-circle back to the original film. If not an outright remake, it definitely feels like genuine homage. I&#39;m excited to see it."
"3213","Godzilla Minus One",2023-11-07,"Here living in Japan, I‚Äôve watched it 3 days ago and it was really good.<br>It‚Äôs clearly making reference and paying homage to the original film and Godzilla was scary as heck."
"3214","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Gojira roaring in a berserk rage &amp; pain after being chared by the warhead/fatman is truly a haunting sight to behold. the line &quot;that monster will never fogive us&quot; &amp; Sakura Ando (i think) staring out the train car window forced to stare down Gojira helplessly as he aproaches slowly, helps to show the audience this Gojira is DREAD incarnate."
"3215","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"Looks incredible !"
"3216","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-04,"Personally, I love that Godzilla as a concept can easily skew toward a destructive &quot;guardian&quot; beast, and toward a horrific monster out of nightmare.  The legacy has had both numerous times, and each side of the coin can be a treat.  This looks to be more traditional than Shin&#39;s weirdness, and I&#39;m here for it.  The original monster updated again for modern times."
"3217","Godzilla Minus One",2023-11-30,"I&#39;m on my way home from seeing it! Day One. So I won&#39;t say too much other than this: The human script, the visual sights and sounds and the monster action were altogether very awesome! As with Legendary&#39;s Godzilla 2014, this 2023 Toho movie ended with you wanting to see more, but the character of the monster was more true to the original movie&#39;s monster. The monster&#39;s look was about up there with that classic-faced 1964 version. It will be one of my top favorites."
"3218","Godzilla Minus One",2023-09-05,"It looks incredible.  I wonder what Honda, Nakajima and Tsuburaya would think of their 1954 masterpiece in comparison..  I really love the fact that they hold true to the original aspects of character/storyline while breathing a bit of modern Japanese culture.  I cannot wait to watch this iconic movie in theaters."
"3219","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I&#39;m impressed. The idea for the story about the actual GT Academy Events is really authentic. Good job Sony and Polyphony Digital"
"3220","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"&quot;I know this track, I&#39;ve raced it a thousand times&quot;. Only a GT fan knows that feeling. üòä"
"3221","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"‚ÄúI know this track, I‚Äôve raced it a thousand times‚Äù  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVPzGBvPrzw&amp;t=136"">2:16</a>  gives me chills all the time. <br><br>I know what it‚Äôs like to play the same track over and over. Failing and failing then finally nailing it and now this guy gets to experience it in real life! Amazing trailer, can‚Äôt wait for the movie."
"3222","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This looks pretty good actually. I was kinda skeptical but it&#39;s way better than I thought, it seems really a belivable story, great trailer."
"3223","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"As a GT player, I feel like it will be so easy for me to relate to the protagonist and get immersed in his story. A few months ago I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this project. Now I&#39;m excited."
"3224","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"People like Jimmy Broadbent have shown that you can go from a sim racer to a real racer and do well at it. Glad to see a movie being made about a story like that."
"3225","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This looks awesome!!üòéüòé"
"3226","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Love seeing motorsport culture in the limelight! ü§©üèÅ"
"3227","Gran Turismo",2023-05-06,"I haven&#39;t seen a film that actually portrays racing as something like a sport in so so long, way to go!"
"3228","Gran Turismo",2023-05-07,"Being honest. I played racing games for years, and a week before my driving test was the first time I hopped in a car. I passed the test. Everything felt so natural. In some sense I can relate to this."
"3229","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Whether you&#39;re a gaming fan, racing fan or just a person in general, there is something adrenaline pumping watching cars racing at high speeds incredibly close to each other and the limit. Love the game, definitely looking forward to the movie"
"3230","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Total trust in Neil Blomkamp for this ! This is a really interesting, actual and exciting point of view. I&#39;m sure that the images on track will be breathtaking"
"3231","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Going so far to take a gamer and let him drive real race tracks is already something. But this is not fiction, this really happens out there and we see another monumental step that is him getting a whole movie about pretty much his life (with more or less action scenes and drama added to it). I cant imagine the rollercoaster this guys been on... Thanks for believing in gamers!"
"3232","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"This movie will be epic.<br>All Millennials remember GT1 and how groundbreaking it was. Getting the A class license after 100&#39;s of hours actually helps with real life driving as well, there were game mechanics so unforgiving it ingrains self control in your head, I feel it when I&#39;m speeding after midnight on the highway."
"3233","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"I played Gran Turismo when I was a kid and it gave me a great appreciation for the sport of European car racing and will always has a special place in my heart. This film looks like it sticks to the source material."
"3234","Gran Turismo",2023-05-07,"A video game movie that doesn‚Äôt shy away from where it comes from but leans into it is always in my book a must see."
"3235","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"I have to admit I‚Äôm impressed. When I heard they were making Gran Turismo (a game that I love) into a movie, I was skeptical. But I really like the premise of this movie and now I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it."
"3236","Gran Turismo",2023-08-24,"Anyone who&#39;s on the fence about seeing this movie, go. It was fucking awesome. I was going in with average hopes for a decent movie, but it actually surpassed them. The actors were great, the editing and cinematography was top notch and the racing was incredibly done. Being a gamer / fan of Playstation only helped my enjoyment, but even if you&#39;re not a hardcore gamer you&#39;ll find a lot to love here. 8.5/10 for me."
"3237","Gran Turismo",2023-06-22,"I&#39;m not a Gran Turismo fan, but just being a gamer in general. This brought tears into my eyes."
"3238","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Looks pretty dope, but remember &quot;keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed&quot; - Kratos"
"3239","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This GT movie is gonna be just THIS GOOD as the game itself!"
"3240","Gran Turismo",2023-08-22,"just got back from the cinema, and safe to say, this was an absolute gem of a movie! would definitely watch it again!!"
"3241","Gran Turismo",2023-05-06,"How did Sony manage to keep something looking this good a secret in this day and age? This looks pleasantly surprising, keep up the good work Sony!"
"3242","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Neil Blomkamp directed District 9! Best believe it will be a banger!üî•üî•üî•"
"3243","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"So dope. When I was kid and I destroyed GT2. This was the dream in my head that I never thought could actually happen. Amazing. And what an incredible director. One of my favorites."
"3244","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Out of left field. Did not expect this to be dope, and Neil directing means this should be incredible."
"3245","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"More car movies like this are definitely neededü§©. The fact that its based on a true story is just madüôåüèΩ"
"3246","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This genuinely is better than what I was expecting"
"3247","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Director is actually great, his vision very clear and accurate. This movie is gonna be next level in racing genre üî•üî•üî•"
"3248","Gran Turismo",2023-05-06,"Neil Blomkamp has always been a promising director and criminally underrated ever since his debut. Glad to see him behind this. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic job."
"3249","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Finally, a movie studio and a game studio that both get what it takes to make a movie about gaming. Here&#39;s to hoping the final result is as good as the trailer."
"3250","Gran Turismo",2023-08-14,"This brought tears to my eyes. I remember playing Gran Turismo to help with my driving lessons. When used with the steering wheel set, it felt as real as it gets and helped me a great deal - held my license for 10 years plus now and this game helped a great deal. Watched this movie and it is awesome - A must-see!"
"3251","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"Neill Blomkamp was not expecting that. This looks actually solid af‚ù§"
"3252","Gran Turismo",2023-05-05,"So stoked for this!"
"3253","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This story about a real Sim racer is what actually starred online sim racing. In my opinion the Grand Turismo Academy was way ahead of what is happening today , and  actually turned gamers into real racers. <br>This Nissan PlayStation GT Academy started the first challenge in 2008. It was very popular in its day."
"3254","Gran Turismo",2023-06-10,"As a gamer and someone who played PlayStation as a kid so much in the early 2000s-2010,   I have to say this brings back memories.  So hyped for this"
"3255","Gran Turismo",2023-08-11,"If you suspect that in this movie, there‚Äôs a lot of racing, you‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs way more than a lot. If you love game, you would love the movie."
"3256","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Has absolutely no right to look as good as it does for a video game movie. Bravo because this has some magical looking elements and truly looks like it could pull of something special for the video game/ movie franchise and community! üî•üî•üî•"
"3257","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I would watch this in a heartbeat, adaptation from gamer to real life, very cool concept, elements of a true story and a rags to riches tale to boot, sign me up, this is the stuff dreams are made of!"
"3258","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"When I clicked on this I thought it would look awful, but now I&#39;m hyped and actually want to watch it!"
"3259","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Having watched Jann&#39;s story from the beginning of the first academy trial video, his accident at the nurburgring, and his le mans attempts with Nissan, this movie is very exciting, and very surreal."
"3260","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"As a Gran Turismo 4 fan, I cannot believe this is real. I always kinda had that dream back in the day with GT4, obviously real life is real life, but glad to see a movie out of this &quot;dream&quot; most of us internally have when playing Gran Turismo !!!"
"3261","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"No way this looks far better than I expected. I‚Äôm actually excited to see this"
"3262","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This is actually really freaking good! I am genuinely hyped for this! Good job Sony!"
"3263","Gran Turismo",2023-08-05,"As a 14.000 hours Gran Turismo player, I gotta say this gave me goosebumps. Wanted to apply to GT Academy a few years ago, yet some family issues made me stay put... feel sorry for that oportunity even in the present day...<br>To everyone outhere, chase your dreams, don&#39;t let it slip!"
"3264","Gran Turismo",2023-05-04,"Been playing GT since GT3 A-Spec, and now, finding out it&#39;s going to have a film is beyond nostalgic for me. I can&#39;t wait!"
"3265","Gran Turismo",2023-05-06,"I love how this movie is based on the games but also based on a true story"
"3266","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"It&#39;s even more AMAZING that this is based on a REAL story<br>Jann Mardenborough&#39;s career üí•"
"3267","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I like how this looks actually. Just enough to be different and not too far off from how people see the sim racing vs. real world thing. HOPEFULLY the main characters can carry the story as well as the heavy hitters, but I think this is one i&#39;ll actually go to the theaters for!"
"3268","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"I&#39;m used to seeing a Neill Blomkamp directed feature as being realistic and gritty. This looks realistic and squeaky clean. Nice to see he&#39;s not a one trick pony. It&#39;s just the way you&#39;d expect Gran Turismo to look. I know Sony and Polyphony Digital must&#39;ve had a lot of say in the appearance and production of the movie. It&#39;s a great collaboration that, so far, looks to really be paying off. Looking forward to seeing how this one turns out..."
"3269","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Nearly had me crying, granturismo been my life since I started playing at 10 years old with granturismo 2 ... I actually qualified for &quot;granturismo academy&quot; with my controller in 77th places with millions players .. but they took just the first 10 üò¢ I&#39;ll watch this movie definitely"
"3270","Gran Turismo",2023-05-05,"From a childhood game to a movie?! I&#39;m definitely gonna watch it!"
"3271","Gran Turismo",2023-05-07,"I remember watching the documentary on this I was blown away by the fact how radical the idea was and how it paid off hopefully the movie does it justice trailer looks awesome"
"3272","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I am absolutely hyped for this, I loved Gran Turismo so much as a kid and seeing a movie being made just makes me so excited! üôå"
"3273","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Imagine the soundtrack of this film composed by the original songs from the games, like, from Gran Turismo 4 and 2, it would be beautiful"
"3274","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"As a lifelong fan of the Franchise I can‚Äôt wait to sit in a theater and watch this."
"3275","Gran Turismo",2023-08-20,"I got out of the cinema yesterday, stopped on a bench and cried my eyes out. How many of us actually have something to pour our hearts into, besides just pretending we&#39;re living our lives? The only question I&#39;m asking myself now is - which is my race? Probably, a movie that will never let me live comfortably until I find that childhood dream again."
"3276","Gran Turismo",2023-07-24,"in love with the scene in the video where the pistons are so fast and the car just roars around the track gives me goosebumps every time"
"3277","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"Getting GT7 and a PS4 has paid off for me. NOW I&#39;m up to see this movie with my best friend. She saw the sneak peek, and saw the GTR."
"3278","Gran Turismo",2023-06-17,"Being a Generation X&#39;er I grew up with this game when it originally launched on the 1st Playstation back in the 90&#39;s and have seen it evolve into what it is now over the years. Thank you for finally fulfilling a childhood dream of turning it into a movie. I&#39;m definitely going to watch this when it is released!"
"3279","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"This looks legitimately good. I cannot wait for this to come out"
"3280","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"So, this is not a trailer, this is a summary of the whole movie"
"3281","Gran Turismo",2023-08-17,"What a great film. I didn&#39;t think a movie like this was even possible this year. Definitely Top Gun/Karate Kid vibes. Solid story, surprisingly good performances and completely devoid of the MESSAGE. Nothing really exceptional here but it hits all the right beats."
"3282","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Its a subject close to my heart, coming from a family that can&#39;t even afford a car and wanting to go racing myself - GT was my only way and I wish I had what Jann&#39;s generation has in terms of e-sports to help them show that the instincts and talent are lurking undetected in so many people who never get the chance. He did a service to all future generations and showed there is another way in, and to take e-sports seriously. Thankyou Jann."
"3283","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Can‚Äôt wait for this, finally a proper car orientated movie we haven‚Äôt had in a long time"
"3284","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Being addicted to GT7, im glad to see the whole franchise receiving a movie adaptation that doesn‚Äôt even look half bad! Kaz-san will be proud!"
"3285","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"This trailer looks lit .. the transitions from game to live action and vice versa is seamless .. very excited"
"3286","Gran Turismo",2023-06-10,"As a fan of gran turismo, this exceeds levels of unexpected"
"3287","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I don&#39;t typically like any kind of racer, but GT7 on PSVR2 is unreal. Takes the game to the next level when you&#39;re actually in the car"
"3288","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"The beginning just caught me out of guard, it&#39;s better than i expected! Looking forward to it! üòÑüèÅ"
"3289","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"The chills. This game is my identity as a gamer. I every track every car every win every loss every trophy every dream. This movie is already iconic. Thank you Gran Turismo. Thank you sony! The trailer brought a tear of joy"
"3290","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"I was an extra in this film, a pit bench engineer for Team Ford at the Red Bull Ring, and I&#39;m really looking forward to watching this movie :-) It was a great experience beeing a small part of this project! Visit us at the Red Bull Driving Experience!"
"3291","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"I can already tell this will be better than Need for Speed. A great approach to telling this story and I&#39;m even more excited that Neil Blomkamp is behind the camera."
"3292","Gran Turismo",2023-05-02,"i love how they put the game footage from GT7 as well. also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVPzGBvPrzw&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> it could a teaser for the training/license tests us GT players went through"
"3293","Gran Turismo",2023-06-03,"I remember seeing this guy on a documentary a decade ago when I was a kid, it‚Äôs crazy to think that he‚Äôs now getting a film made about his life"
"3294","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"OMG! This looks so good, the cast, the story... I can already imagine the atmosphere and the adrenaline kicking watching this. Just WOW."
"3295","Gran Turismo",2023-05-03,"Can&#39;t WAIT to see Emilia in this full length feature film!  She has more experience in a car than 80% of the names in this movie!"
"3296","The Color Purple",2023-05-22,"FYI: this is NOT a remake of the original movie, it is an adaptation of the tony award winning broadway musical version. the musical is much more closer to the book than the original movie. the musical is vastly different from the original so there is nothing to worry about. this movie will be its own thing. this new version and the original are two completely different movies. both can co-exist without diminishing the other. i think this movie will be amazing and i have no doubt in my mind that it will be a huge success"
"3297","The Color Purple",2023-05-22,"Whew. The way Fantasias voice came in, the eyes welled up and my goosebumps raised. She should have won a TONY for her portrayal and she better not get robbed for her Oscar."

I would make my PaPa sit and watch the original movie over and over again with me. I could tell he would get irritated with me. Lol! That is one of the great memories that I will always cherish that I had with my grandfather.

"3415","The Boogeyman",2023-05-06,"this was hands down the scariest thing I ever read from King. I read it at summer camp in a room with no less than 10 closet doors. That kind of room where one wall is all doors. <del>shivers</del> that room went from ok feeling to the scariest place in the world in one short story. lol I was also like 11 or 12 years old. üòä"
"3416","The Boogeyman",2023-04-20,"Horror movies haven&#39;t been horroring and not so scary to me these past few years but this trailer FOR SURE caught my attention and looks like a must watch!"

"3419","The Boogeyman",2023-04-19,"I&#39;m a purist, so the first thing that I noticed is that it&#39;s obviously a lot different from the original short story that it&#39;s based on. That, however, isn&#39;t always a bad thing. Even I can admit that. <br>Can&#39;t wait to see what the Boogeyman looks like. For some reason as a kid I always imagined that it&#39;d look like Venom from the Spidey comics..."
"3420","The Boogeyman",2023-04-21,"Still looks better than Halloween ends"

"3423","The Boogeyman",2023-04-17,"I still think the original two films from the early 2000s are highly underrated, but I‚Äôll definitely give this a watch/chance."
"3424","The Boogeyman",2023-04-18,"I loved the Stephen King short story when I read it ages ago. This is another case of merely using the story as a jumping off point for a different storyline altogether, though it remains to be seen if they keep the original ending, and I suspect they may have. That being said, this does look good."
"3425","The Boogeyman",2023-04-18,"This trailer will most definitely be better than the movie,because it is a masterpiece in of itself."
"3426","The Boogeyman",2023-04-19,"Never watched Boogeyman (2005) but I love Boogeyman 2 (2008). This looks great definitely seeing more jump scares in this version."

"3435","The Boogeyman",2023-04-17,"Based on a book by Stephen King with key words: Boogeyman, Producer of Stranger Things, someone getting kicked the face by the boogeyman, and John Wick Origins. This is going to be good."

"3454","The Boogeyman",2023-05-09,"Im so excited to see this. Anything with Stephen King Im excited for honestly"
"3455","The Boogeyman",2023-04-17,"So instead of it being about a man haunted by the Boogie Man&#39;s effect on his life, the psychological horror involved, and the losses he experiences through his life its going to be a monster movie about a mom and daughter with nothing but jump scares. The short story, as a parent, was really sad and unnerving. This will be schlock."
"3456","The Boogeyman",2023-04-17,"If John Wick doesn&#39;t come in the end and kill the fuckinn boogeyman. I am giving this movie 0 stars."
"3457","The Boogeyman",2023-06-01,"&quot;The thing that comes for your kids when you&#39;re not paying attention&quot; is such a perfect description. <br><br>This story stands in for kids not being believed by mothers about step dad&#39;s abuse, not being listened to when they&#39;re truly threatened by bullies (would the parents be OK with regular assaults that no one did anything about? Hardly).<br><br>So many of King&#39;s books talk about how unseeing the adults are, which allows evil to run rampant, such as in &quot;It&quot;.<br><br>The adults never notice that anything is even wrong, there&#39;s no huge response to so many missing kids.<br><br>Inattention is perhaps the biggest form of evil."
"3458","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"It&#39;s heartening to see that Michelle Yeoh is finally getting the recognition she deserves and getting offered more diverse roles than the usual Asian archetypes."
"3459","A Haunting in Venice",2023-08-09,"I know these movies usually aren‚Äôt hugely successful at the box office so I‚Äôm very appreciative they keep making them. They have been well made and fun to watch."
"3460","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"It probably won&#39;t be a full on horror movie, but the mere presence of those semi-horror elements makes this one of the most unusual but also interesting ideas I&#39;ve seen this year. I&#39;m curious how well it&#39;ll do after release."
"3461","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-20,"Now THIS is how you make a sequel. Throw the characters into a different genre, and watch it unfold. This looks like it&#39;s going to be better than the last two movies. Very few movies are afraid to switch genres, especially with the third movie in the series. For that reason alone, I hope that this is a great success. It&#39;s great when movies try something different."
"3462","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-20,"I love that we have these detective films with Branagh‚Äôs Poirot and Craig‚Äôs Blanc. Now all we need is Downey‚Äôs Holmes to make a comeback. It‚Äôs a nice genre of film that is a breath of fresh air"
"3463","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"Tina Fey in a drama?! And she looks amazing. Can‚Äôt wait for this. It goes without saying that Michelle Yeoh will be brilliant."

"3467","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"SO EXCITIED FOR THIS! Mystery/Crime/Horror is such a rare genre in films! Will definitely watch this in cinemas!"
"3468","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"It overflows with quality, as always the cinematography, the actors, the costumes, the music, Poirot&#39;s accent... I can&#39;t wait to see it. Kenneth Branagh is synonymous with skill and talent üôåüôå"
"3469","A Haunting in Venice",2023-08-04,"I‚Äôm simply going to see this just because Tina Fey is in this! Love Her! The entire cast is amazing but I love her and to see her take on a role like this excites me. She looks amazing!"
"3470","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-26,"I LOVE that they&#39;re taking a different spin on this third one. the cinematography looks stunning. and for someone who&#39;s usually too scared to watch actual horror movies, this one looks just palatable enough for me to handle. can&#39;t wait."
"3471","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"This looks SO GOOD! Excellent cast, beautiful cinematography, loving the direction Branagh is taking with this one."
"3472","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-20,"I admire the new direction this franchise is taking. A whodunnit/horror movie is such a good combination of genres. Here is hoping that the movie hold up to the hype that this trailer created!"
"3473","A Haunting in Venice",2023-09-14,"I watched this movie  yesterday in Paris. For me is the best of the trilogy. Lovely photography. Venice was so beautiful on screen. The best performances were Kenneth and Michell, and also the boy reading EAP. This is about to be my favorite Halloween movie for a while. Congratulations to Kenneth Branagh and to this team of actors üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº"
"3474","A Haunting in Venice",2023-08-01,"Bruh they need to market this movie better. The only reason I knew it existed was because I saw a poster of it on my at out of the theater.  I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed it was a sequel if I hadn‚Äôt seen his distance appearance either.  I‚Äôm excited as hell for this movie though"
"3475","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-28,"Now this is unique and original. I love when a story has a genre switch. The first 2 movies were good, but this one looks amazing."

"3482","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-19,"Hercule is up for a new challenge that will test his resolve, beliefs, and sanity. However, he has one thing going for him. Only the living would kill someone to cover something up."
"3483","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-20,"We are so used to hercule in situations where everything is objective and grounded. But now he is faced with having to deal with things that could be supernatural or not. I honestly think its a good idea. It puts him in unfamiliar territory"
"3484","A Haunting in Venice",2023-07-20,"Obviously, David Souchet will always be the Hercule Poirot. <br><br>However, what Kenneth Brannagh is bringing to the cinematic with Poirot is truly wonderful, and I hope this is a universe that brings many more stories to the big screen cause I am all for it üòä"

The second film may have not been as good as the first (and suffered form some really bad CG environments), but both films have been visually extraordinary when it comes to camera movement and shot composition (though, again, the first film moreso than the second, but it&#39;s still in there for the second). <br><br>They do an excellent job of keeping confined environments really interesting and dynamic to look at (it could have easily been restricted to more static cameras and talking heads in different hands).

"3541","The Creator",2023-07-17,"This is how CGI was supposed to look like in every major studios movies for the last decade. How Edwards managed to accomplish such beautiful vfx with only 20 mil budget is speaking volumes."
"3542","The Creator",2023-07-18,"Honestly at this point, Gareth Edwards will draw me to any movie. This looks incredible, I will definitely be seeing this in cinemas."
"3543","The Creator",2023-08-19,"This is giving so many Last of Us/Cyberpunk/Detroit vibes and I freaking love that! Result‚Äôs gonna be a truly breathtaking cinematic experience, I can feel it!"
"3544","The Creator",2023-07-17,"As a aspiring filmmaker, I‚Äôve rarely been as hyped as I am for this film. The whole thing was shot on a FX3! Looks insane!"
"3545","The Creator",2023-09-28,"Just saw it. The whole theater remained speechless and almost paralyzed after the end. Probably the best sci-fi movie I‚Äôve seen so far. Forget Star Wars. Simply amazing."
"3546","The Creator",2023-09-27,"Just saw this &amp; walked out of the theatre, never since watching T2 Judgement day have I Been this SCI-Fi happy. This will be a epic true cult classic in no time, Hans Zimmer on the score &amp; Greig Fraser‚Äôs/Oren soffer‚Äôs Cinematography with Gareth‚Äôs directing really crafted a unforgettable &amp; timely masterpiece."
"3547","The Creator",2023-08-14,"What really made this trailer stand out was the story. Plus the imagery looks fantastic. I‚Äôve seen Rogue One only once, but the story was well written. ‚ÄúThe Creator‚Äù seems to follow in the footsteps of ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù but with its own twist. I‚Äôm excited for this!"
"3548","The Creator",2023-07-17,"I&#39;m definitely gonna go and see The Creator. I saw the first teaser trailer for the film advertised when I went to see Mission Impossible 7 Part 1 and it completely blew my mind. We need more original mainstream blockbuster films like this and not just Sequels, Prequels, Spin offs, Remakes, Reboots or Superhero films."
"3549","The Creator",2023-07-17,"From the director of rogue one and 2014&#39;s Godzilla. <br>Perfect timing this to be the first trailer from a Disney studio to come out 24 hours after the actors union goes on strike. I probably won&#39;t have time to see this (busy schedule) in theaters but I did love Gareth Edward&#39;s take on Godzilla and Star Wars."
"3550","The Creator",2023-08-31,"This movie is gonna be insane to see and experience on the big screen. I‚Äôm definitely gonna have a good time seeing this movie."
"3551","The Creator",2023-09-28,"Just got back from watching this movie. Cinematography on point, cool story, cool act from actor/actress, it feels natural and real. Awesome."
"3552","The Creator",2023-08-06,"Dystopian. Sci-fi. Action. Adventure. Philosophy. This is not just giving me a good movie, but every genre of movie I love all in one. This trailer made me read more about Gareth Edwards others movies and let me just say that my week is made..."
"3553","The Creator",2023-07-17,"This looks incredible! I always try to go out of my way to support these new projects without any established IP. Can&#39;t wait!"
"3554","The Creator",2023-07-17,"A completely original movie made by an established director.<br>I am down for this 100%. This looks incredible.<br><br>Let&#39;s hope everyone else is so that we can keep getting more of this."
"3555","The Creator",2023-08-03,"Just so everyone knows at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=25"">0:25</a> they used real footage of the 2020 Beirut explosion, of course some buildings were added and some were modified. Search it up to see a side by side comparison."
"3556","The Creator",2023-07-17,"Love it! Cool story, excellent cast, stunning visuals and good action. Gareth Edwards never disappoints! AND NOT A PREQUEL, SEQUEL, REQUEL, REBOOT of a known IP! Extra Points for that!"
"3557","The Creator",2023-07-21,"Finally, a refreshing sci-fi movie once in a while and with Hans Zimmer for the music as well. Getting real tired of how most movies keep doing the multiverse trend lately so this one&#39;s a breath of fresh air."
"3558","The Creator",2023-07-18,"This has promise! Everything from this trailer looks great, from the visuals to story. I really hope it delivers. Marking it on my calendar, because original projects like these really should be supported at the box office.<br>Also really dig the robot designs. Something about humanoid robots with funny heads wearing clothes just jives with me. Love it."
"3559","The Creator",2023-07-29,"Felt so real, so real that they even use the footage from Beirut explosion <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=24"">0:24</a>. I mean man, tf are you doing?"
"3560","The Creator",2023-07-17,"I&#39;m happy and excited this is coming to theaters and not direct to streaming. This looks epic."
"3561","The Creator",2023-07-17,"I especially love the tech design and the story elements sound like a rock solid near future plot... An absolute must-see for me..."
"3562","The Creator",2023-07-17,"Let&#39;s go! One of my favourite directors is back! Definitely watching this film multiple times."
"3563","The Creator",2023-09-28,"This movie is incredible. It contributes something new to the Science Fiction genre as well as the world of robotics and AI. This film creates a new ethical standpoint on how we view machines and how they view us. Superb."
"3564","The Creator",2023-07-17,"Can&#39;t wait for this movie, Dune and Rebel Moon. The three biggest Sci-Fi epics of this year üî•"
"3565","The Creator",2023-07-17,"Great trailer, great choice of music. Looks like a movie worth watching at the cinema. I&#39;ll be watching this at IMAX."
"3566","The Creator",2023-07-17,"This reminds me so much of Neill Blomkamp! I&#39;m all here for it :)"
"3567","The Creator",2023-07-20,"Rogue One is arguably my favorite Star Wars film. So, knowing that the director behind it is involved with this film, I&#39;m pretty excited to see it."
"3568","The Creator",2023-08-18,"As a big fan of Gareth Edwards&#39; feature film debut, &quot;Monsters,&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed his rendition of &quot;Godzilla&quot; and most of &quot;Rogue One&quot;! He&#39;s also a visual effects artist and I feel like it shows in how he directs VFX-heavy sequences. I read that the on-location filming for this one had a very indie approach (like &quot;Monsters&quot;), so I&#39;m really looking forward to what Edwards and team will show us this time around ‚Äì¬†I just wish it had a less generic title. üòÜ"
"3569","The Creator",2023-07-17,"This honestly looks like an instant sci-fi classic! I am so excited that this is an ORIGINAL film and not an already existing idea or brand! I&#39;m in that theater on day one!!!"
"3570","The Creator",2023-07-21,"Nice to see an original story coming to the big screen.  Projects fail because its rendition after rendition of stories in IPs already known.  Exploration and experimenting is what makes theatres great again.  VERY excited for this"
"3571","The Creator",2023-07-17,"this kid is killing it in this trailer, so many emotions"
"3572","The Creator",2023-08-26,"I love how this isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúAI bad, human good‚Äù. It tells how AI aren‚Äôt really that different from humans, up to a certain point. It‚Äôs like 2 nations at war, thinking the other is evil, but they just have different interests, and neither is bad."
"3573","The Creator",2023-07-29,"Waiting for my Corridor crew fans to inform people about the stock footage from the Beirut explosion"
"3574","The Creator",2023-07-19,"Whoever is the designer for the Weapons Costumes and so on will win an award.100 % sure. Every little  second this Trailer looks awesome. Overall Picture with the choose of colours, Lense choice, Perspective, light, Cut, every second is awesome."
"3575","The Creator",2023-09-11,"The fact that this was shot on Sony FX3&#39;s only, makes it 10 times better. Absolutely incredible! <br>If you&#39;re not impressed, google the camera - it&#39;s tiny compared to usually used cinema cameras."
"3576","The Creator",2023-08-31,"I believe this will be beautiful.  The tone, the depth...all seem fantastic.  Also, I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be consumed with sadness at the end."
"3577","The Creator",2023-07-18,"Trailer tugged at my heart strings.<br><br>Production &amp; story looks amazing. Better than any other trailer I seen in a minute.<br><br>I shall be watching this upon release"
"3578","The Creator",2023-08-22,"This actually looks so good. Refreshing to see something else in cinema"
"3579","The Creator",2023-07-17,"Hands down to one of the best cinematographer ever"
"3580","The Creator",2023-07-17,"The fact that this was shot on the Sony fx3 ($4000 camera) is insane. Shows equipment doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre amazing at what you do."
"3581","The Creator",2023-07-22,"100% going to watch this as soon as it hits the big screen. Looks incredible!"
"3582","The Creator",2023-07-20,"I always wanted someone to make a trailer-style remaster of Dream On. I just wish these studios would release them on separate tracks so we could listen to them cause it‚Äôs a bop"
"3583","The Creator",2023-07-22,"This actually looks amazing! I&#39;ll definitely be watching this in theatres!"
"3584","The Creator",2023-07-23,"This is magnificent. This is incredible. This is original and yet seems something that we have seen and was lost during all these years. This is something we crave . This is cinema. This is what exactly we go to cinemas. People please go and watch this in theatres. Make it a hit. We deserve good movies and good movies deserve the due recognition from us."
"3585","The Creator",2023-08-05,"The storyline with the background dream on gave literal chills ‚ù§"
"3586","The Creator",2023-08-24,"The CGI, VFX and everything looks crazy good!"
"3587","The Creator",2023-08-12,"Don‚Äôt think anyone realizes that we have this movie, Napoleon, AND Dune part 2 all coming out around the same time! What a time to be alive!"
"3588","The Creator",2023-07-17,"As a student going to pursue a career in computer studies, this is absolutely a must watch."
"3589","The Creator",2023-09-19,"I just read about the production of this movie and it blew me away and made me want to watch the movie in theatre. This movie is an old school filmmaking: using panavision anamorphic lens,  guerilla style shooting in real locations across the globe, indie style filmmaking twist with the use of sony mirrorless (FX3) as it&#39;s primary camera. <br><br>The creative team and work behind this movie gives me hope of a great film."
"3590","The Creator",2023-07-29,"The fact that footage from a real tragedy ( Beirut Explosion ) was used makes me really hesitant to be excited now for this... I really hope it gets removed or redone, have some respect.<br>For those curious: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=24"">0:24</a>"
"3591","The Creator",2023-08-07,"Ok but are we going to talk about how they used real footage of a real tragedy just so that their trailer looks good?"
"3592","The Creator",2023-07-17,"I like original films that aren&#39;t based on remakes, reboots and this does look awesome as this kind of trailer pumps me up"
"3593","80 for Brady",2022-12-06,"Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda were incredible in Grace and Frankie. It became one of my favorite shows of all time. And now to that power couple we also add the legend Rita Moreno and Sally Field? I&#39;m so excited about this movie. And I&#39;m so excited about the future of Hollywood if it continues this path of giving main roles like these to older icons so they can continue to gift us their talent."
"3594","80 for Brady",2023-01-15,"The fact that Tom Brady himself is producing a movie about older women played by some quite high profile actresses being infatuated with him sounds like a fever dream."

"3660","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"I feel like any actor would be honored to be in a ghibli film"
"3661","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"It has already been released in Spain, and I can tell you that you are not prepared for this masterpiece. It deserves to be seen in a movie theater"
"3662","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Just in the trailer alone you can see shades of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Totoro, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. It truly feels like this is the culmination of Miyazaki&#39;s life&#39;s work, and hopefully will be the shining masterpiece it seems."
"3663","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Rob Pattinson&#39;s voice acting is incredible. The direction for the english cast in Ghibli movies are always stellar."
"3664","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"This is IMO the most ambitious, and best, movie Hayao Miyazaki has made since Spirited Away. No one does it quite like him. It&#39;s just pure, cinematic magic that transports you to another world."
"3665","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-08,"I have to remind myself of how grateful I am to see hayao miazaki films in theaters. He truly is of the last masters of his form. I will never gain the experience nor the understanding of why his films just have this sort of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù factor to them, but I am 100% certain that it‚Äôs there. That there is a sort of magic in his films that I can feel. Thank god that I got to live in the same time as the great hayao miazaki. It has a been a true honor to not have watched his films but to have experienced them. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie in theaters. To see it anywhere but on the biggest screen possible would be (to myself) a sin to the love of movies. People sometimes ask about certain pieces of art and say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make like they use too‚Äù or something along those lines, but I want you to know that this movie is one of those movies. There will never be a movie like the boy and the heron. It truly is the last movie of a bygone era of animated movies where animation had this much care and attention to the world itself. You will find movies that will imitate and maybe be inspired by its style but never find another that is THIS AUTHENTIC to its source. If I haven‚Äôt made it clear enough, I really do urge people to see this movie. <br><br>Edit:<br>Just saw the movie and I can confidently say that hayao miazaki still that greatness and that magic that‚Äôs in all of his movies. It was definitely his most personal and his most complex movie to date. It‚Äôs one of those movies that‚Äôs not easily digestible and may take 2 or more viewings to truly gain an understanding of what you saw. I‚Äôm going to see it again and try to see if I can get a better understanding of it entire. Also in every studio ghibli movie there is always that one moment where I‚Äôm watching it and i just look upon in wonder and awe and say ‚Äúwow‚Äù. This movie has those moments. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I said those words in a theater before. I know it kind of cliche to say this but DAMN IS THIS MOVIE BEAUTIFUL."
"3666","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-04,"The pure joy and warmth I get out of watching any Ghibli movie is undescribable. My fiance and I have watched the movies over a dozen times but we won&#39;t get tired. Thank you mother for showing me Kiki and Totoro at a young age. Your love sparks with every Ghibli scene. And thank you everyone at Studio Ghibli. You can&#39;t imagine the importance of your movies for my health."
"3667","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"The way a ghibli film will give me goosebumps every time is uncanny."
"3668","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Pattinson as the Heron is ridiculous in all the best ways"
"3669","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"The amount of people who think the heron is willem or mark is hilarious. Robert is just that good at transforming his voice apparently"
"3670","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"All of Miyazaki&#39;s movies make me cry. They are just too damn beautiful. From Nausica, to this, I am never not amazed. I am so excited to watch this, and just grateful we all get another movie out of him."
"3671","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"the animation is so damn clean, especially the fire scenes, words just cant express its pure beauty!!"
"3672","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-07,"Saw this today in Belgium, it&#39;s a masterpiece. It feels like a &quot;conclusion&quot; of sorts to both Spirited Away and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. You are not prepared how strange, creepy and beautiful this story is."
"3673","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"I never thought I&#39;d see another Miyazaki film released in my lifetime. I&#39;m so exited to see this one! legit brought me to tears."
"3674","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"They weren&#39;t lying. After watching it two times, even though I still think Spirited away and Princess mononoke are masterpieces, this movie feels like his Magnum Opus."
"3675","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Robert Pattinson as the Heron is unrecognizable!!! I can&#39;t wait to watch this"
"3676","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-08,"&quot;You see this world....there&#39;s more work to be done&quot;. I was already getting goosebumps due to the animation and editing. This line just brought everything to a climax"
"3677","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Anyone else finding it very strange how we can‚Äôt tell that that‚Äôs Robert Pattinson voicing the Heron? You‚Äôd imagine Williem Dafoe or Mark Hamil were the ones voicing him. Very good voice acting range from Pattinson there."
"3678","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Idk what is it with Miyazki&#39;s films, but even a trailer for them makes me cry like a baby."
"3679","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-21,"I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one that feels like this but there&#39;s something about the films made by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli that now any time I see their style of animation it instantly fills me with joy"
"3680","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-10,"Wow, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve gotten goosebumps from a preview like this. I&#39;m glad every time Miyazaki-san comes out of retirement to make &quot;just one more movie&quot; because it&#39;s such a treat to live in his worlds. ü•∞"
"3681","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Only a ghibli trailer could have me tearing up even when I&#39;ve just got a vague idea of what the movie will be about üíïü•∫"
"3682","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"What a stacked cast. And wow, that animation is clean as hell, can definitely see why it took six years to make this film. Great job everyone, can&#39;t wait to see this."
"3683","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Studio Ghibli&#39;s films have been close to my heart since I was very young. Such emotion, such comfort, such joy they have brought me. To see yet another film from the masters on the big screen, and a new story inspired by such a classic book, I can only imagine how incredible it will be in it&#39;s entirety."
"3684","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-16,"The trailer alone made me shed a tear; the voice acting is impactful as well, just pure emotion put into it"
"3685","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Full English stacked is just like candy, this is insane to see how some came back and do it justice every time‚ù§Ô∏è"
"3686","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Pattinson&#39;s voice from being a Cringe Vampire to Batman to Grey Heron üò≥<br>Him and Suda Masaki impressed meü•≤"
"3687","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"This is a pretty interesting trailer. The characters look interesting, the animation is incredible, and voice cast is stacked. But I can‚Äôt believe Miyazaki is back directing his 12th feature film at the age of 83. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. In terms of animated films, did he directed more movies than other animators?"
"3688","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"There is no mistaking this for anything other than a true Miyazaki piece. I hope it does splendidly in the USA."

"3693","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Robert Pattinson&#39;s voice as the Heron is so eerie i almost thought it was dubbed by Willem Dafoe."
"3694","The Boy and the Heron",2023-12-04,"It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôve done something I always love seeing - taking the techniques learned to animate specialized scenes and apply them moving forward. Anyone who saw Suzume knows what I mean. Regardless of director/production it‚Äôs not only smart practice but makes the entire set of movies feel cohesive stylistically!"
"3695","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"I dont understand how The Heron is Robert Pattinson? I cant hear his voice at all, its insane. He has so much range"
"3696","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"I went to Japan a month ago and last thing i did was see this movie in japanese (i don&#39;t know Japanese). Even without speaking the language, the movie stunned me. I can&#39;t wait to see it again here in the States, and get the full experience this time!"
"3697","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"This feels like classic Hayao. Can‚Äôt wait to see it. Ghibli movies have a certain quiet magic and they weave a spell over the viewer than other animation can‚Äôt."
"3698","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-09,"I don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s about but I&#39;m tearing up just watching the trailer. I can&#39;t wait. No one can do it quite like Ghibli."
"3699","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-13,"I&#39;ve seen it yesterday and let me tell you, this is not just one of Miyazaki&#39;s greatest films to date, it is simply one of year&#39;s best films period. The storytelling, cinematography, pacing, all remarkable, a true work of art. I did see it in its original japanese dubbing, and that&#39;s how I recommend it to be seen."
"3700","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-04,"A tool to heal our collective souls - a beautiful and accurate way to describe most Miyazaki movies. He stands apart from other Japanese storytellers who are usually obsessed with tragedy and loss (something to do with the history of Japan perhaps), in that his tales almost always end with the triumph of hope and love."
"3701","The Boy and the Heron",2023-12-06,"Studio Ghibli will always have that effect on me wherein you want to be in their world everytime you watched their movies.<br>so excited to see it back with this kind of animation ‚ù§"
"3702","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-04,"This has to be one of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen. The music, the imagery, the voice acting, it‚Äôs all so perfect. I haven‚Äôt been this excited to see a movie in years."
"3703","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"As a Japanese who have watched this film 10 times in Japan. This is masterpiece"

"3705","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Can&#39;t wait to see this one. Would have never guessed that voice was Robert Pattinson either"
"3706","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-03,"Ugh can&#39;t wait, my heart needs this.  So happy he made another film. I will definitely go to the theater even though it&#39;s always packed due to the lack of screenings.  It is a cool feeling being surrounded by people who collectively have so much admiration for the work."
"3707","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"I need to see the voice recording sessions of Robert Pattinson doing the Heron voice."
"3708","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-14,"I watched this masterpiece with my husband during our honeymoon at a cinema in Shinjuku without having watched the trailer and understanding only 5 words in Japanese (the movie was, of course, in the original language without any subtitle). Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s prowess in visual storytelling, combined with Joe Hisaishi&#39;s musical talents, still managed to touch and awe us. <br><br>We can&#39;t wait to watch this newest (and apparently final) work of Hayao Miyazaki when it&#39;s available in our country - with subtitles this time. :)"
"3709","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-17,"I was not sure what I saw when I left a theater but the impression it left was something I rarely felt in my life after a movie... and it comes back with the same intensity every time I think about the movie."
"3710","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"this trailer gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes from its sheer visceral beauty. outstanding."
"3711","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-04,"Perhaps the best by Miyazaki, the Studio Ghibli, of the Japanese Anime and among Japan movies, and may even be a triumph of philosophical history of mankind."
"3712","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-08,"I wish this a animation style was more prevalent these days , it draws out emotion in characters so well üëè"
"3713","The Boy and the Heron",2023-11-02,"Could we just say it now, this will be a masterpiece. Studio Ghibli is life."
"3714","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I am so proud of Dave. He chose a film career in a much more artistic way than all the other bling-ass wrestlers. And he didn&#39;t just choose them because of the content, but he also justifies each and every role he takes. A truly credible man."
"3715","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Anytime Dave Bautista wears glasses, you know he&#39;s gonna give the performance of a lifetime."
"3716","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-24,"&quot;But my heart is broken.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it broken?&quot;<br>&quot;Because of what I have to do today.&quot;<br>CHILLS. I&#39;m so excited for this film."
"3717","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-23,"Man, Dave is growing so much as an actor. It‚Äôs great to see. He‚Äôs a legitimately great dramatic performer now, totally believable"
"3718","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I‚Äôm happy Bautista is getting real acting roles instead of just being the big strong guy in movies."
"3719","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Bautista straight brings it. He chose a better film career path than other wrestler turned actors. I wonder what they think of him‚Ä¶also nice seeing Rupert Grint lately!"
"3720","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"While M Night Shyamalan is hit or miss, when he does low budget thrillers he‚Äôs at his best."
"3721","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"i know M Night gets a lot of hate, but he&#39;s actually one of the most creative and thrilling directors! Although his movies are hit or miss, when he has a hit it&#39;s a HIT!!"
"3722","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"As someone who has read the book, I always wondered who will play Leonard. To me, he is the most interesting character. Crazy, but also loving. Never would have thought of Bautista to be playing Leonard, but oh man, his casting is spot on.<br><br>Big, hulking dude who has very much a psychopath storyline but also has a loving heart. This is gonna be a good portrayal."
"3723","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Reminder this was shot with 90s lenses. It‚Äôs gonna have a very unique feel in the theater. Can‚Äôt wait!"
"3724","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I unironically love Shyamalan and can&#39;t wait to see this. His movies may be really dumb some times, but they always manage to feel fresh and different compared to most Hollywood drivel."
"3725","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I love that Shyamalan gives each movie a distinctive look.  This doesnt look like other movies."
"3726","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I‚Äôm glad people get to see how great of an actor Batista really is. Best actor to come out of wrestling for sure."
"3727","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-23,"I love the trailers like this"
"3728","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Unnerving, unsettling, creepy, and insane. Everything a film like this should be. Excited for this one."
"3729","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-26,"the little girl is amazing!!! the genuine fear in her eyes it‚Äôs so chilling at her age. can‚Äôt wait to see this."
"3730","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"It&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t even mention the book this was based on by Paul Trembly. It&#39;s so well written and he deserves the credit.<br>Edit: some asshole left spoilers in this comment thread so don‚Äôt open it if you want to avoid spoilers."
"3731","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I love the trailers like this that don‚Äôt tell us too much but get us so excited for the movie."
"3732","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I really do love M. Night movies. <br>Even if they‚Äôre terribly and super cringe at times, I feel like he‚Äôs one of those rare directors (like a Nolan) that simply gets to make whatever movie he wants to make and it‚Äôs gets a mainstream platform theatrical release. <br>The man, for better or worse, has never comprised on his choices for the last 20 years of filmmaking. Not an endorsement of his bad films (we can all agree he‚Äôs made some horrible Dreck) but I can‚Äôt help but be excited when he puts a new movie out that is specifically his style."
"3733","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-02,"for those who haven&#39;t read the book....... boy are you in for a ride that&#39;s gonna make you angry. and i mean that in the best way possible"
"3734","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-25,"So excited to see Jonathan Groff get more roles like this."
"3735","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Wow, Rupert Grint is also in the movie, it&#39;s great to see Ron Weasley back :)"
"3736","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-28,"So‚Ä¶. Mitch, Cam, and Lily go on vacation and Mitch has a bad paranoid dream‚Ä¶ got it üòÇ"
"3737","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I loved the book and this actually looks good. Plus it has Jonathan Groff in it which is always a good thing!"
"3738","Knock at the Cabin",2022-10-02,"Bautista is the man!  So proud of him and his acting career!  And look at Rupert too!  M Night really pulled together a great team!"
"3739","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-25,"Just read the book a few weeks ago and I am so excited. It looks so far to be pretty faithful to the original, and if it continues that way, it is going to be a fantastic movie"
"3740","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I loved the book and wasn&#39;t even aware they were making an adaptation.  I&#39;m freaking out at this trailer. This is going to be fantastic!!"
"3741","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"i love trailers like this that catches your attention by the mood of the music, how the music switches into something ominous, uses sounds as beats with physical action and doesn&#39;t show you much of what the movie may be about. especially since this is from M Night Shyamalan i cant wait it to see the twist and turns. and since there&#39;s 2 other screenwriters it might be better since he has his own unique way to end his films, this might be different and actually good."
"3742","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Okay, I really loved the book, and when I heard that it was being adapted into a film I was really skeptical, but I have to admit that this looks pretty good! The characters don‚Äôt look how I imagined them, but honestly that‚Äôs not something that matters to me. I just hope that they stay true to the beautifully-grim plot of that novel by Paul tremblay!"
"3743","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"God damn this looks good. This is how trailers for horror movies should be done. They probably showed only the first 25 minutes of the movie tops and showed only what they needed to to catch audiences attention. Can‚Äôt wait to see it."
"3744","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-23,"OMG the little actress‚Äôs range is insane‚Ä¶ Super star actress in the making üòÆ"
"3745","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Well dang this might actually be one of the better M. Night movies"
"3746","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-26,"Dave Bautista‚Äôs delivery of the lines here are genuinely spooky and gave me chills!"
"3747","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"For those that already read the book will know the end but Shaymalan will surely add his own twist at the story."
"3748","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-23,"I am so proud of Batista. Growing up he was one of my heroes in pro wrestling. So to see him become such a character driven actor is so refreshing and heart warming !!"
"3749","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Wow the trailer is almost exactly like the beginning of the book. Down to the position of the characters when they enter the house and the dad&#39;s reactions."
"3750","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I had no idea they were making this book into a movie! The book still haunts me to this day. Looks very good."
"3751","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"The four strangers are obviously the four horsemen of the apocalypse as they are also rocking the same colors of the four horsemen on their shirts."
"3752","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-20,"Just finished the book 10/10! Amazing, can&#39;t wait for this, plus great cast and director."
"3753","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-06,"The knocking sounds give me chills"
"3754","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-25,"Dave Bautista has come a long way in his acting career!! He‚Äôs going to absolutely nail it in this movie!!"
"3755","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-24,"‚ÄúThe most important job in the history of the world‚Äù<br><br>With a line like that, this better be good"
"3756","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-24,"I&#39;m just addicted to M. Night Shyamalan. Even his more infamous movies like Lady in the water has his signature kindness oozing. Hope this one is a masterpiece like Unbreakable."
"3757","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"They‚Äôre just here to talk to the dads about their car‚Äôs extended warranty."
"3758","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"KING IS BACK. No matter what you think of him, M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most original directors of our time. Hella excited for this."
"3759","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-25,"Happy to see Rupert on screen again, it&#39;s been a long time!"
"3760","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"With the kind of characters Dave is playing lately, it looks like an Oscar might not be far away."
"3761","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"I clicked on the trailer out of pure chance. <br><br>As soon as I saw M. Night Shyamalan pop-up on the screen...I knew we were in for a ride."
"3762","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-27,"M. Night deserves a lifetime achievement award for trailers"
"3763","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Don&#39;t care what people say about m. Night films, they&#39;re always fun to watch!"
"3764","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-24,"Dave has been killing it. Love watching anything he‚Äôs in."
"3765","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-23,"Jonathan Groff! Loved him in Mindhunter so I can‚Äôt wait to see him in this"
"3766","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-27,"Dave is such an underrated actor I swear he kills it in every role can‚Äôt wait to see this üî•"
"3767","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"wow !! i‚Äôm surprised this much was shown in an M . Night Shyamalan trailer , this looks great!"
"3768","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Huge fan of Shyamalan. Love his style of thrillers especially the ones with a massive plot twist like The sixth sense, The village, Devil (he was a co-writer in that), etc. Can anyone please suggest more such movies please??"
"3769","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-27,"Someone pointed out a great detail. Bautista and his cohorts are wearing shirt colors that symbolize the four horsemen of the apocalypse.<br>From left to right. Black for Famine. Yellow in place of Pale for Death. Bautista is wearing a white shirt for Conquest. And the guy in red represents War."
"3770","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-24,"This is based on the book The Cabin At The End of The World. I&#39;m actually glad to see Shaymalan taking on a work based on another writers work. It will be cool to see what he does with it!"
"3771","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"Wow, I read this book, and the shots look exactly the way I pictured it in my head!  Can&#39;t wait for this!!"
"3772","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-27,"I really, really love what Batista is doing with his career. His acting gets better and better and he doesnt let himself get typecast into the big unstoppable brute in every film. I think he could someday be nominated for a performance."
"3773","Knock at the Cabin",2022-10-28,"This looks really good. I didn‚Äôt think David  Bautista could pull a role like this off when I heard he was cast. How wrong I was! He delivers that sombre terror just fine!! Cannot wait to see it on the big screen with a large üçø"
"3774","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-27,"Say what you will about M Night but he never fails to come up with super interesting premises even if they fall short at times"
"3775","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-25,"I love how Bautista keeps choosing Auteurs to work with. Denis Villeneuve, Zack Snyder, M Night, Rian Johnson. Man&#39;s got an amazing taste when it comes to choosing roles."
"3776","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"The fact that this much was shown excites me cause obviously M Night always has twists and turns so if the trailer lets us know that much then there is another bigger twist lurking in the shadows. (My guess is the twist is that they are telling the truth and the apocalypse is real but maybe the family doesn‚Äôt have to die for it‚Ä¶ not likely)"
"3777","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"This looks lit, amazing AF. <br><br>If M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s career was solely based on movie trailers, he&#39;d be the greatest filmmaker of all-time lolol."
"3778","Knock at the Cabin",2022-12-02,"Jonathan Groff in M Night movie, I‚Äôm there"
"3779","Knock at the Cabin",2022-09-22,"This is based off one of my fav books of all time! They better not change the ending üò©"

Never take your eyes from them, keep a hand or one of those leash backpacks on them, etc. Which isn&#39;t bad, kids are easy targets being smaller and weaker.<br><br>But this is highlighting how parents can be taken. I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;look out for your mom&quot; growing up unless she wasn&#39;t feeling well. But shouldn&#39;t we look out for them? Aren&#39;t children naturally responsive to a new man or woman their parents date?

"3915","Missing",2022-12-18,"In my eyes this movie combines three movie concepts in 1: First, the visuals and atmosphere of Searching. 2: The kidnapping from Taken. 3: The real life dark web stuff of Unfriended 2. All together is interesting movie trailer"

But in reality, Jolo is a heavily militarized island.

"3963","65",2022-12-14,"If this movie makes dinosaurs feel like frightening beasts that would be right outside your window while you sleep then I&#39;m all for it. I like the atmosphere it gives and the question of &quot;are they going to survive&quot;. Because the dinos are the least of their worries"
"3964","65",2022-12-14,"Surprising that Adam driver, a 6&#39;4 military veteran hasn&#39;t really played an action hero before. Looking forward to it"

"3966","65",2022-12-14,"Adam Driver fighting Dinosaurs with sci-fi technology is something I never even knew I needed until now! And Dinosaurs are actually terrifying again! I‚Äôm hyped."
"3967","65",2022-12-15,"This is new. Seeing Adam Driver in a solo movie without any big names and with what looks like a great plot seems great to me."
"3968","65",2022-12-18,"Finally, an acknowledgement for how terrifying it would be to live in this period. No hole small enough that something couldn‚Äôt eat you"

"3971","65",2022-12-15,"Clearly Adam for a long time missed his calling to be in survival horror films. Some how he‚Äôs actually perfect for this and it shows in the trailer. Hope he gets cast in more."
"3972","65",2022-12-15,"I actually kind of like this plotline as a &quot;humans are really alien colonists on Earth&quot; style of twist; it will be interesting to see where they go with it in this movie."
"3973","65",2022-12-19,"This is basically a Dinosaur movie in an Alien/Xenomorph fashion, almost looks like Alien Covenant but with Dinosaurs, absolutely amazing"
"3974","65",2022-12-20,"I love it when a movie comes along that&#39;s able to hook me just on the premise alone."
"3975","65",2022-12-15,"This gives off major Dino crisis vibes. I‚Äôm so glad we are getting a horror oriented dinosaur movie, I‚Äôve waited a long time for such movie. Universal, take notes!"

"3977","65",2022-12-15,"I love how it‚Äôs not a time travel movie where we go back to the past, but other humans from another world. It‚Äôs interesting that they consider Dinos to be ‚Äúaliens‚Äù when we consider them as past life."
"3978","65",2022-12-14,"Wow, I‚Äôm so happy that someone at Hollywood remembered that dinosaurs(while amazing) are horrifying creatures. I can‚Äôt wait!!!"

"3989","65",2022-12-21,"Adam driver is a phenomenal actor! I can‚Äôt wait to see this just because of his role in it."
"3990","65",2022-12-15,"That Dinosaur reveal with a lightning flash behind the protagonists was a really cool one. When they were looking at the dark cave and the camera kept after them as they stepped backward, I was like &quot;it&#39;s behind them isn&#39;t it?&quot;"
"3991","65",2022-12-15,"Adam Driver looks like he‚Äôs gonna be <i>amazing</i> in this, and I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of Ripley and Newt (from ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù) seeing him and the bond his character‚Äôs developing with this little girl.

"3994","65",2022-12-15,"It‚Äôs like a blend of every sci-fi action movie ever made"
"3995","65",2023-01-11,"Definitely need more dino movies with the horror element this film looks to have."
"3996","65",2022-12-14,"I am so hyped! We haven‚Äôt had a big budget dinosaur film that‚Äôs not Jurassic World in forever!"
"3997","65",2022-12-20,"This has SO much potential, cannot wait to see this in theaters! Finally a dinosaur movie that isn&#39;t Jurassic Park..."
"3998","65",2022-12-15,"Yes! More movies with magnificent Adam driver. I absolutely love him and everything. He carried the Star Wars sequels"

"4002","65",2022-12-15,"I absolutely love that Adam Driver is playing this role. This movie is gonna be great"
"4003","65",2022-12-17,"I love how they kept the details of this movie a secret for years then this trailer came out and it was different from what everyone anticipated. I‚Äôm 100% sure there‚Äôs a lot more surprises and thrills in the actual film than what they already revealed in the trailer which makes it even more exciting to watch. Clever move! I hope they drop a 2nd trailer soon."
"4004","65",2023-02-27,"I love Adam driver in military type roles. His real-life experience just brings so much to his acting. It&#39;s phenomenal."
"4005","65",2022-12-14,"Man, I&#39;ve been anticipating this movie for quite a long time back when it was announced. And I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that this looked totally different from what I was expecting it to be,other than hearing the rumblings that it involved dinosaurs. Plus, I greatly enjoyed the work of Scott Beck and Bryan Woods from the first A Quiet Place movie, and I want to see what more of their work. Cannot wait to see 65 in action!"
"4006","65",2022-12-15,"65 is what you get when you combine Pitch Black and Jurassic Park and I&#39;m here for it."
"4007","65",2022-12-14,"I suppose I‚Äôm in, we rarely get fresh movies free from existing franchises or remakes these days so this is a breath of fresh air<br>Also I‚Äôm glad Adam is in it he‚Äôs pretty talented outside of SW which mostly everyone knows him for<br><br>Also Sam raimi? A quiet place writers? I‚Äôm definitely in"
"4008","65",2022-12-14,"Big Turok vibes from this one. Hopefully theres more Dino enemies then just the standard Raptor and Rex. There‚Äôs so much potential!<br><br>I went back and looked at the different creatures shown off. Looks like there‚Äôs a semi aquatic creature, a Rex, raptors, and an unknown theropod at around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXejJq5vr0&amp;t=118"">1:58</a>.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a Rex cause it has long front arms that don‚Äôt match the later shots of the Rex. So it looks like there‚Äôs gonna be the basic spread of having a small, medium, and large carnivore. Definitely interested to see what species they name drop<br><br>Someone in the comments has a great eye and caught that the Dino is different then the raptors at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXejJq5vr0&amp;t=147"">2:27</a>. It‚Äôs feet don‚Äôt have sickle claws and in the full body shot it looks like there‚Äôs a beak and a head crest. There‚Äôs gonna be Oviraptors!"
"4009","65",2022-12-14,"That fact that Sam Raimi is helping make this movie got me hyped I really wanna see some new horror elements for this"
"4010","65",2022-12-19,"This looks one of those films that could be mediocre yet still incredibly fun to watch. I think it looks great, I love the concept."
"4011","65",2022-12-14,"Oh my god, this felt refreshing to see. I‚Äôm definitely gonna be watching this once it hits theaters!"
"4012","65",2022-12-14,"We need some more dystopian scifi films like these. Go Sony!"
"4013","65",2023-02-16,"Man I&#39;ve been wanting to see a horror style movie involving dinosaurs for SO long. The overall concept and setting seems great. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
"4014","65",2022-12-18,"Ive really been appreciating Adam Drivers movies lately."
"4015","65",2022-12-14,"This looks AWESOME. I didn‚Äôt know creating a good looking dinosaur movie that isn‚Äôt Jurassic Park was possible. Kudos to the CGI department and design team!"
"4016","65",2022-12-15,"The Turok vibes are strong in this one.. Love it"
"4017","65",2022-12-14,"This definitely gives off Predator/Jurassic Park vibes, plus the people who wrote A Quiet Place and director Raimi worked on this with the badass himself, Adam Driver?! I‚Äôm all in! <br>Finally, a movie where pterosaurs are a part of nature vs man, I hope this doesn‚Äôt flop."
"4018","65",2022-12-15,"Glad to see Adam Driver as the main character, he&#39;s a really great actor"
"4019","65",2022-12-15,"This looks really good"
"4020","65",2022-12-18,"Finally Adam Driver will be in a good Sci Fi movie. Much deserved great actor."
"4021","65",2022-12-19,"This actually looks really entertaining. Like a combination of two of my favourite movies. Aliens and Jurassic park. I look forward to seeing it when it releases! üòÄ"
"4022","65",2022-12-18,"If this can replicate even a morsel of the excitement and joy I had as when I was 10 years old in the theater watching Jurassic Park then then I am so EFFIN in!!!  If Bruce Campbel comes in to save the day then I might just cry as well."
"4023","65",2022-12-14,"Finally a new Dinosaur movie that is a Jurassic Movie, I‚Äôm a huge a fan of Dinosaurs so this gets me very excited"
"4024","65",2022-12-15,"Looks pretty cool! Adam Driver is pretty much excellent in everything he does. Hope to see more movies starring him!"
"4025","65",2022-12-14,"Anything with Adam Driver in it is worth watching but Adam + Dinosaurs is something I‚Äôd watch on repeat! I‚Äôve been waiting for so long to watch him in an action movie but this only gets better because not only it‚Äôs an action movie but he‚Äôs also in a soldier type of character! This is maybe the closest we get to seeing his Marine skills."
"4026","65",2022-12-18,"Finally, the Turok movie I‚Äôve always wanted."
"4027","65",2022-12-15,"Film actually looks like it has nuance to it unlike most movies nowadays. Very creative plot and adam driver as the main character in a thriller-horror movie seems like a great idea"
"4028","65",2023-02-14,"I love that T Rex. Such a good actor. He&#39;s in so many good movies, Jurassic Park, King Kong, Lost World, Aztec Rex, Meet the Robinsons.<br>Kinda one dimensional but very good."
"4029","65",2022-12-14,"Dang, wasn&#39;t expecting dinosaurs. Kinda was hoping for an actual alien planet but I am very intrigued by the premise and look."

And what I love is that it seems to take itself seriously- meaning it&#39;s just the right level of camp without being absurd or trying to be a comedy. Too many slashers are comedic these days, but I love how violent, dark and nasty this one is."

"4062","Thanksgiving",2023-10-04,"Ever since the mock trailer in Grindhouse happened, I always hoped they would make this movie! Pretty excited about it!"
"4063","Thanksgiving",2023-10-04,"You gotta be kidding me!!?! OMG!!!!! I can not believe he actually made it into a film! The grindhouse double feature was epic and this was the funniest trailer of them all. I can‚Äôt wait"

"4065","Thanksgiving",2023-10-05,"I appreciate that this horror movie has the killer utilizing the Thanksgiving holiday as part of his inventive kills! It takes advantage of the holiday horror aspect! I‚Äôm sold! ü¶É"
"4066","Thanksgiving",2023-11-06,"Excellent trailer that really keeps your attention.  My only concern is that it, like many other horror movie trailers, show too much.

"4169","My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3",2023-08-25,"Probably the only franchise that actually gets consistently better with each movie. The first is a super cliche mildly funny romp with ok acting. The 2nd is actually really well acted, very heartfelt, and significantly more funny. And this one looks beautiful, charming, and introduces a ton of new plot courses. It‚Äôs also kinda nice they‚Äôre moving past the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm embarrassed I‚Äôm Greek‚Äù as this looks to be the perfect blend of poking fun at Greek tropes and wearing it proudly.

He is an Indigenous man (white passing) and very much not Greek üòÇ and was engaged to a Greek woman well before he met my Mum (they never married, he and this woman, but he still never spoke ill of her, despite the messy breakup - or anyone for that matter). Everytime he saw this movie he&#39;s like THAT WAS MY LIFE. They were planning the adult christening and everything üòÇ and always shouted ROYCE as a family whenever he entered the room. Idno, it&#39;s weird we obvi aren&#39;t Greek but these movies are so wholesome and fun, and remind me of him. ‚ù§‚ù§ It&#39;s going to be hard with her father having passed for this film, but I am still excited nonetheless.

"4184","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"Imagine your movie being so stacked that you forgot to add Margot Robbie and Edward Norton in the trailer"
"4185","Asteroid City",2023-05-21,"Wes always nails one thing:  The mundane awkwardness of a normal conversation.  In a way, I think everything about his style of filming (the angles, pacing, color palate) is built around setting the tone for these moments.  We see and feel the uncertainty of one spoken word to the next, and we smile, as we see ourselves."
"4186","Asteroid City",2023-05-22,"My favourite thing about Wes Anderson films is despite the whimsical, almost childlike nature of their aesthetic there is a dark melancholy that permeates throughout the story. Really makes the buttoned down emotions of his characters sing"
"4187","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"it&#39;s crazy how he always take the actors on his world and made them look like they were always from there"
"4188","Asteroid City",2023-05-19,"I have seen every one of Wes Anderson&#39;s films, and he never disappoints.  They are truly bizarre, but in an enjoyable, likable way.

"4190","Asteroid City",2023-03-30,"God I love Wes Anderon&#39;s style so much.  One of the true artistic voices out there along with Tarantino and a few others.  You just feel it in your bones that it&#39;s them when you watch a trailer, before even a few seconds have gone by."

My dad introduced me to Wes Anderson when I was still pretty young, and since then I&#39;ve really grown to love his movies. Moonrise kingdom is literally my fav movie of all time, closely followed by The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Royal Tenenbaums. I also LOVE Fantastic Mr. Fox. Okay I just love all his movies. Anyways I&#39;m super excited to see this one!"

"4219","Asteroid City",2023-05-10,"I am a Wes Anderson fan. He never made a bad movie (my favorite of his movies is The Royal Tenenbaums) and honestly, this movie looks enjoyable. I might want to watch it at the theater when it comes out"

"4227","Asteroid City",2023-05-29,"Mr. Anderson why are you so perfect?"
"4228","Asteroid City",2023-04-07,"I bet so many well-known actors are just excitedly waiting for Wes Anderson to call them and ask them to be in his next movie. They always look so fun to act in."
"4229","Asteroid City",2023-05-01,"I thought we&#39;d never get that much sub bass in a Wes film. Dude&#39;s keeping it fresh with every one and that&#39;s why I&#39;m such a fan"
"4230","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"Love seeing that Stephen Park is in this. Underrated actor!"
"4231","Asteroid City",2023-04-03,"Just like Once Upon A Time In Hollywood in 2019 and Licorice Pizza in 2021/2022, what a perfect summer film to treat us with this year. I can&#39;t wait to watch this in a cinema basked in the heat of the summer air - it is always one of my highlights of a summer to watch a film in the cinema at least once."

Not to mention he totally reminds me of a young version of Jason Schwartzman, on par with Rushmore, it‚Äôs perfect casting. I think we‚Äôll see him in more of WA movies in the future"
"4234","Asteroid City",2023-03-30,"Jason Schwartzman hasn&#39;t been a lead in a Wes Anderson movie since The Darjeeling Limited, cool to see him playing a new kind of character for him."
"4235","Asteroid City",2023-05-25,"There‚Äôs a very distinctive Wes Anderson silence in-between-things that it‚Äôs hypnotic and addictive. And you‚Äôre constantly cued up for the next line of dialogue. I siesta think I don‚Äôt like it until I‚Äôm watching it and I‚Äôm BOOM back in the wagon."
"4236","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"Love the color pallette. Definitely needs to be enjoyed on the big screen."

"4238","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"There‚Äôs always an excitement to an Anderson Trailer, it‚Äôs feels comforting but slightly jarring but you know it will never disappoint."
"4239","Asteroid City",2023-03-29,"Wes Anderson once again demonstrates his ability to wrangle half of Hollywood into one of his films. It won&#39;t be long before he makes an ensemble equivalent to that of Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer, Robert Altman&#39;s Gosford Park and Charlie Kaufman&#39;s Synecdoche, New York combined."
"4240","Asteroid City",2023-04-05,"I watched every detail of this trailer and I have no clue what it is about but I‚Äôll probably still watch it because seeing quirky pastel famous people uttering random phrases at each other in monotone is still somehow entertaining when Wes Andersen does it."

"4252","Asteroid City",2023-03-30,"It&#39;s bizzare to see this trailer. I started to get interested in Wes Anderson&#39;s films when I saw some fanmade edit of Moonlight Kingdom around week ago. And I think that recently I became quite captivated by this kind of style of making movies. This fascination started pretty quickly and rapidly and even yesterday I was wondering what next Wes&#39; film would look a like... So, it&#39;s a weird thing to discover the next day that there will be his newest film in June. I always have been told not to look for some signs from the uniwerse, but still it feels like this coincidence is too strange to be completely real."

The quick clips of the guys dancing on the stairs and the hostess dancing are taken straight from the Magic Mike live show for anyone who has seen the show in person or the recorded clips from audience members that have floated around on here. They extrapolated everything and it has culminated in this. Channing and his business partners did it. Now, this is the &quot;what if&quot; Channing&#39;s character, Mike Lane achieved the same thing. Perfect for Valentine&#39;s Day."

Right? Like, while pretending to be a couple, they find out things about each other that deepens their connection and they end up falling in love. But neither wants to admit it to the other. And then at the end, just when the woman he‚Äôs trying to make jealous comes around and you think he‚Äôs going to go off with her, and Sweeney‚Äôs character is sad‚Ä¶he shows up at her door and is like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one I‚Äôm in love with.‚Äù<br><br>Crazy, I know.

But I still rlly respect and like both of these actors, who‚Äôve done great work in the past, so i rlly dont mind seeing them pair up, not sure if they have that much chemistry though. Still, weird that considering how many movies that are released that are fantastic but dumped onto streaming services and forgotten but then u have the most predictable mediocre run-of-the-mill films that get theatrical release"

While the training is brutal (esp in early spring, we&#39;re talking 5:30 am wake up calls in the freezing cold, followed by the dreaded erg machine), there is something hauntingly beautiful about rowing on the water when all that hard work just comes together. I do miss it."

All the obstacles that were put in their way yet they still managed to overcome each one. That documentary was fantastic and I still think about it. I had no idea they&#39;d made a movie out of it.

"4545","Priscilla",2023-10-05,"For anyone curious, I believe this film is based on Priscilla&#39;s own memoir, and she approves of this movie. I&#39;m sure at least a few people are wondering if this sort of biopic is still ethical, but this one at least is."
"4546","Priscilla",2023-10-14,"The tone shift when he said &quot;what do you mean, you don&#39;t like it?&quot;, when he wanted her to change her hair was absolute perfection. Sofia always makes such incredible films, especially centered around the female perspective. I cannot wait ."
"4547","Priscilla",2023-10-04,"This looks SO GOOD. The narrative decision to centre this on Priscilla&#39;s POV (I think it&#39;s based on her autobiography?) is a stroke of genius. I&#39;ve never been much of an Elvis fan, but I&#39;m finding myself genuinely excited to watch this one. I think in Coppola&#39;s hands the humanity of the characters (based on real people) will be far more nuanced &amp; won&#39;t shy away from the darkness in the story. &amp; these actors are absolutely nailing it from what I&#39;ve seen."

Elvis &amp; Me was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was fascinated by their tumultuous love story.

"4585","Priscilla",2023-10-06,"I‚Äôve read her book so many times. I loved the 1988 movie. Looks like this one is going more in depth. I love Elvis. I‚Äôve been to Graceland 8 times. Sounds crazy? He was an still is so electrifying. She has a right to tell her story and it‚Äôs one that deserves to be told in the best possible way. He would literally make her walk around the house balancing a book on her head. Would tap her forehead, if she crinkled it. She lived to please him an did whatever he said because she loved him and didn‚Äôt want to lose him. I hate that some are so negative towards Priscilla. She was 14, just setting in a local hangout in Germany. When Currie Grant comes up to her an asked if she liked Elvis Presley? What‚Äôs the odds? It was meant to be. Things were different back then. We‚Äôre talking about 1959. The world has changed"

"4594","Priscilla",2023-10-05,"Personally I think this movie looks great. Cinematography wise and acting wise everything is top notch, but what I can‚Äôt take seriously is the nuances of this story. Pricilla Presley is NOTORIOUS for switching her narrative whenever it benefits her. Following Elvis‚Äô death she was in full support of him and upholding his name, but began writing the Elvis &amp; Me book after she realized it would garner a lot of traction into the ‚Äúprivate life‚Äù of Elvis. But soon after she retracted a lot of her statements made in the book and on some occasions even flat out implied she was never groomed by Elvis. She then went straight back to being in full support of Elvis to support the movie which would grant her a lot of money, but now that she‚Äôs getting a film made about her, her opinions on Elvis is slowly shifting back to anti-Elvis message. I‚Äôm not saying that these events didn‚Äôt have or could‚Äôve happened, but to me Pricilla is a VERY unreliable narrator. I hate to see a guy get his reputation tarnished when he‚Äôs not even alive to defend himself. There are numerous people who can attest to Elvis being a good man who suffered a lot from depressing during the later and even earlier moments in his life. What I think is funny about this trailer is the whole bit about Pricilla saying she didn‚Äôt like the makeup and Elvis being all evil about it, but Pricilla has stated before when addressing the indirect comments about grooming where she said she really liked the makeup and thought it made her look pretty. She did note how it was more or less in Elvis‚Äô style, but he probably did that because he liked them to be matching. I think is hilarious how people connect this to ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù like no couple is history has ever gone out in matching clothing. Also about the age thing, yes Pricilla was 14 and he was 24 but Pricilla commented how their first couple interactions were nothing more than a fan meeting her idol. Elvis only did so because she was the daughter of one of his officers when he was in the army. Elvis was even in a relationship at the time with an actress. Pricilla complained about Elvis not returning her letters because at the time he really didn‚Äôt have an attraction to her. It was only after her parents pushed and Elvis‚Äô friends pushed that they finally began getting closer. Elvis set many boundaries between himself and Pricilla because he did know there was a big age gap between the two. By some accounts Elvis didn‚Äôt even want to be in the relationship but his manager Colonel Parker thought it would be good publicity for Elvis to have a beautiful woman by his side. So really in my opinion both were being played by people much older than the both of them."
"4595","Priscilla",2023-10-06,"Has to be tough playing Elvis in a movie right after Austin Butler delivered that generational performance."
"4596","Priscilla",2023-10-03,"Tricky doing this role after someone has just knocked it out of the park recently"

Then, when I was in high school, Judy Blume wrote Forever and it changed how I felt about boys/dating as a teen.

"4649","Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023-04-16,"I grew up in the 70s reading many Judy Blume books and this one was the very first. Brings back a lot of good childhood memories,  I was an avid reader and loved going to the library and bringing home a stack of books. I will be taking my two middle school  neice&#39;s to see the movie, great coming of age story."
"4650","Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023-04-10,"On one hand, I‚Äôm mind-boggled that it took this long to make this classic into a movie and I‚Äôm thrilled that new generations will have a chance to discover this book. Like a lot of 70s and 80s kids, I read my copy of Are You There God to shreds. On the other hand I‚Äôm glad that they waited til now because an earlier version would have gone in too hard on the ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù of the topic and probably been painful to watch, and this looks like it has a much lighter touch. I‚Äôm looking forward to it."

"4652","Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023-04-14,"To say I love this book is such an understatement. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go outside as a kid so I read Judy Blume and Beverly Clearly books. Every Friday our class had library and I checked out a new book. I bought my tickets already for the April 19th showing. I‚Äôm almost 46 years old and if this movie hadn‚Äôt come out until I was 86, I would still go to see it. I am SO excited!!"

"4665","Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023-01-13,"Probably like a lot of people, this was one of the books I reread the most as a kid - it both taught me what a period was and shaped my views on God. I never thought it could be made into a movie because a lot of the story is about periods and I wasn&#39;t sure how that would come across on screen, but this looks good."

"4687","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-02-25,"For Russell Crowe to be in an exorcist movie, means that the script was worth it"

"4706","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-04-05,"From being raised catholic, I understand it is near impossible to even get permission to do an exorcism. All medical avenues need to be exhausted and parlor tricks do not get a pass to get permission. I&#39;ve always been totally fascinated by the process and the fact that there is such a place these things were documented."

His books are amazing and I would highly recommend that you read them before you watch the movie. The movie is going to give you a lot of Hollywood hype."
"4712","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-03-17,"It‚Äôs great to see Alex Essoe in another movie. Incredible and very underrated actress. The fact that she and Russell Crowe are in this is enough for me to check it out."

"4716","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-04-05,"This really has the feel of a mystery behind the horror which I love. And Russel like plays the veteran detective. This is based on a real man where he performed about 10,000 exorcists. Russel got to know the people The exorcist worked with and he said you can tell that these people truly believe they had these experiences whether you believe in it or not. I personally have had demons whisper to me vile things in a different language but I understood what they were getting at during a sleep paralysis episode. After that there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind these entities exist and when I prayed to Jesus I haven‚Äôt had an episode since. There are countless stories like mine. Look up the asbury revival exorcism and listen to the scream that comes out of the ladies mouth. It‚Äôs authentic footage. Hundreds of people were there. Evil absolutely does exist and is not subjective."
"4717","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-03-01,"This looks so good. It has the vibes of a thriller/paranormal thing and not an horror movie."
"4718","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-02-23,"I will never get tired of these Possession or Exorcist films.<br>In fact they make up a good chunk of my horror film DVD collection."
"4719","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-03-30,"I&#39;ve read one of Father Gabriel Amorth&#39;s books. They have plenty of terrifying material to work with. Also if you have done any research into the rites of exorcism you&#39;ll find his name is everywhere. Russel Crowe is a great actor, he&#39;s had some not so great roles lately. I feel like this could and should redeem that. <br><br>There are a lot of really good books, interviews and witnesses in addition to other media types they can use for this.

"4751","The Pope's Exorcist",2023-02-27,"This looks amazing.  Possession is real people. I have seen someone shapeshifted in front of me when I was in a college classroom.  There was a Goth girl that use to sit next to me in class all the time.  One day I said something to the professor and she started laughing and that is when her voice and face changed.  No one else seemed to notice it.  I was generally freaked out and froze in fear.  When she saw that I saw what inhabited her body, She then got up and left the classroom.  After that she never sat next to me again and started avoiding me.  There were times she missed class for days.  After that I remembered how odd she use to smell.  It wasn&#39;t a body odor and she always looked clean and dressed nice in her Goth fashion, but she had an odd odor about her and sometimes it seems as if she had a shadow or an out of focus mist covering her body.  Like she was out of focus.  Every time she sat next to me I always had to grab my scarf or sweater because I started freezing for some reason.  The day that thing popped out of her it all started to make sense to me.  Weird stuff started happening in my home for weeks.  I was generally freaked the hell out.  Its almost like it was mad that it exposed itself to me.  I had to blessed my home everyday until most of the weirdness stopped.  It never completely went away until we sold that condo.  There are unexplained and explained things out here people.  The Church knows it and they have the tools to expel most demons and possessed people."

"4754","The Holdovers",2023-07-19,"I love how this was obviously shot on film and feels like a late 80s early 90s dramedy. This is how you organically involve aesthetics in your art without making the point of the art the aesthetics themselves"
"4755","The Holdovers",2023-07-27,"The actor here Dominic Sessa was one of my brothers childhood best friends and this is his first breakout work and I‚Äôm so shocked and excited to see him in this"
"4756","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This trailer feels so much like what trailers felt like in the late 90s or early 2000s... movie trailer voice, the editing between the music and the voices/lines and the shots, that very particular tempo between those three things... It struck me how I haven&#39;t seen a trailer like this in very a long time. It&#39;s super well made, just on that basis.<br><br>And a movie directed by the director of The Descendants, and with Paul Giamatti playing a History or Classics professor... I&#39;m in!!"
"4757","The Holdovers",2023-07-25,"Theres been a lot of throwback films recently but this has to be the most authentic emulation I&#39;ve seen yet. Even the sound, which I don&#39;t really know how they did at all, its so heartwarming to see. I&#39;m real excited to see this"
"4758","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"I feel like Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph is on the Octavia Spencer career trajectory where she&#39;s doing these supporting roles in so many different genres and absolutely KILLING it and then she&#39;s gonna get that one breakout part that truly lifts her into A-list and I am absolutely here for all of it."
"4759","The Holdovers",2023-07-23,"I&#39;m beyond excited for &#39;The Holdovers&#39;! The fact that they filmed at Fairhaven High School, my old stomping grounds, just adds an extra layer of anticipation. Seeing the Knipe Auditorium on the big screen, where I used to hang out and goof off between classes, is going to be a surreal experience. It&#39;s not every day you get to see a place so familiar and full of personal memories featured in a movie. Can&#39;t wait to see it!"
"4760","The Holdovers",2023-07-22,"I love how this movie feels like an 80‚Äôs or 90‚Äôs movie that got locked in a vault for 30 or 40 years and is just now being released. Looks great! Looks unique and different. Can‚Äôt wait!"
"4761","The Holdovers",2023-07-19,"That is a very &#39;70s style old school trailer with the narration, the freeze frame, and let me tell you I am HERE FOR IT"
"4762","The Holdovers",2023-08-04,"I was a background actor in this film. I cannot wait to see the entire film! Just the scenes I was involved in were hilarious! I forsee an Oscar for this film! (not for me LOL)"
"4763","The Holdovers",2023-09-11,"&quot;I find the world a bitter and complicated place and it seems to feel the same way about me. I think you and I have this in common.&quot; <br><br>Just give Giamatti the Oscar already"
"4764","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This is the year for Paul Giamatti&#39;s Oscar that he truly deserved for Sideways."
"4765","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"The Breakfast Club meets Dead Poets Society. I&#39;m game."
"4766","The Holdovers",2023-07-18,"I haven‚Äôt been excited for an indie film in a long time. This looks fantastic."
"4767","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"A trailer which reinstates my belief in Mr. Payne. So well made and it made me smile and also sad. Eagerly waiting!"
"4768","The Holdovers",2023-07-28,"I saw the trailer for this movie for the first time at a theater and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt tell for a bit if this was a new movie or a re-release of a movie from 30-40 years ago. This trailer definitely has me hooked."
"4769","The Holdovers",2023-09-12,"This film does not disappoint. One of Payne&#39;s best!"
"4770","The Holdovers",2023-07-20,"Alexander Payne always makes the characters grow by already throwing them in a complicated life situation"
"4771","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"&quot;Sir, I don&#39;t understand&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s glaringly apparent!&quot;<br>&quot;I can&#39;t fail this class!&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t sell yourself short, Mr. Kountze, I truly believe that you can.&quot;"
"4772","The Holdovers",2023-08-02,"Giamatti is exceptional will definitely see this. He deserves so much more"
"4773","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"Hopefully this movie does well, so that way we can get more movie trailers like this."
"4774","The Holdovers",2023-07-30,"Da‚ÄôVine Joy Randolph better come thru!!! She is fantastic in every role"
"4775","The Holdovers",2023-08-17,"I saw this trailer when I saw Oppenheimer a few days ago, but I have to say I‚Äôm really impressed with the old-school aesthetics to make it look like a movie trailer from the 70s. I always love it when Movie‚Äôs take the extra step to truly emulate the era their setting. Reminds me of the artist which resembled a silent picture of the 20s."
"4776","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This really looks good!! Like it would have been made 30 years ago"
"4777","The Holdovers",2023-07-18,"The characters feel like people! I&#39;ll gladly watch this with my friends, and then watch it again. Bravo Focus Features for this breath of fresh air"
"4778","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"Stunned to see a trailer that doesn&#39;t have the patented Netflix drum banging the drama home to emphasise how you were about to witness the biggest thing ever. Even the new Pixar trailer had it, because Disney presumably told the makers that every film now needs one. I was expecting the only escape I&#39;d ever get from this was to just watch overseas movies like the new Miyazaki, but Payne proves a trailer can be done without it and the Universe doesn&#39;t immediately self destruct afterwards, go figure."
"4779","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"Can‚Äôt go wrong with Payne and Giamatti‚ù§Ô∏è"
"4780","The Holdovers",2023-07-23,"I am absolutely living for this 70s style  film. I‚Äôm SO excited to see this"
"4781","The Holdovers",2023-07-28,"Paul Giamatti is a great and entertaining actor, glad to see Payne return too."
"4782","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"Looks like Paul Giamatti will finally get his long awaited Best Actor nomination!"
"4783","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This looks like an extremely cozy movie! I‚Äôll definitely check it out!!"
"4784","The Holdovers",2023-07-18,"Oh what a breath of fresh air this trailer was!<br>Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
"4785","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This looks like a fresh retro movie, unlike most retro movies it feels like it was written by someone who what around at those times"
"4786","The Holdovers",2023-07-21,"This is exactly the kind of trailer I WANT TO SEE. I love the 70s trailer look, I&#39;m definitely watching it."
"4787","The Holdovers",2023-07-17,"This film is a homage to cinema, for that reason, I&#39;m in!"
"4788","The Holdovers",2023-07-19,"I need this now. For those of us who weren&#39;t born when The Paper Chase or The Chocolate War were released, this is so exciting."
"4789","The Blackening",2023-03-03,"Love how they didn&#39;t let the one guy go alone to look for the fuse box lol"
"4790","The Blackening",2023-03-01,"The fact the guy straightened the other guys gun has me in stitches. lol"

"4799","The Blackening",2023-06-15,"Just saw this at an early screening. I loved it. The whole theater was dying laughing. Do yourself a favor and go see it in theaters before it goes to streaming"

"4835","The Blackening",2023-05-25,"Actually, black characters almost never die first. (Although they almost never survive, either.) In fact, the only movies I can immediately recall where the first victim was black as Scream 2 and Leprechaun in the Hood. Like, if you look at all of Michael, Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Leatherface, and Chucky combined, you‚Äôve got about 40-50 movies where not once is the first victim black.<br><br>I just think it‚Äôs weird that people have always accepted blacks dying first as an actual thing that happens on a regular basis without actually seeing it and not once have I heard anyone call BS on it"

Just let the movie stand on the story and acting alone."

I started getting chills and I felt so comfortable with Him. <br>I knew if I asked Him to play a song on the radio, He would.<br>So I said &quot;Ok Lord, play Come as you are...&quot;<br>I didn&#39;t know what station it was on or anything, but I turned the radio on and the song started playing right on the spot, perfectly...<br>I started getting flooded with chills inside, and started crying. When I got home, He stayed with me for 10 minutes till I got out of the car.<br><br>I&#39;ve been getting answered prayers for around 5 years since, because that visitation eliminated doubt and I follow Biblical instructions as best as I can."

"5012","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-20,"This one‚Äôs for you, Chadwick. if only you could be there to see this tribute in your honor! And I‚Äôll say this, It‚Äôs gonna be an emotional roller coaster ride that‚Äôs for sure!"
"5013","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-11-11,"I just watched this. It&#39;s been just over 4 months since my mum passed. She loved the first Black Panther. This is one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen on a personal, emotional level. Thank you to Ryan Coogler and the team."
"5014","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-04,"I gotta say the music choices for both trailers are just phenomenal. It totally captured the mood and emotions of the trailers and enhance the experience even more."
"5015","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-04,"‚ÄúHis people don‚Äôt call him general or king they call him Kukulkan.‚Äù <br><br>Goosebumps!"
"5016","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-03-08,"Still can&#39;t get over the fact that the song playing in the back ground is front my country,Zambia, even hearing him rap in our language, it&#39;s amazing, ,,,üòçproud Zambian"
"5017","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"I love how Ramonda says to Shuri, &quot;Show them who WE are&quot; whereas in the first movie she said &quot;Show them who YOU are&quot; to T&#39;Challa when he was fighting M&#39;Baku for the throne during challenge day. This gets to show that indeed the Black Panther is the protector of Wakanda and its part of its people."
"5018","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-06,"I know most people aren&#39;t going to agree with me, and I&#39;m sad he&#39;s gone too, but I think incorporating Chadwick&#39;s death into the movie makes it feel more real. He&#39;s gone in real life, he&#39;s gone in the movies and I believe it pays homage to his legacy. In the very short time we saw him on screen he was one of the best comic book portrayals of a character, right up there with RDJ as Tony Stark and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. So deciding not to recast makes it feel like the movie has more weight and realism."
"5019","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"We all know that no one can replace Chadwick Boseman, but I‚Äôm glad that the director, cast, &amp; crew was able to persevere and still be able to deliver this movie.  I got a good feeling about this one.."
"5020","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-05,"Literal goosebumps throughout the trailer. Deep sadness that Chadwick couldn‚Äôt be there to carry this forwards but so much love and pride for the mantle he‚Äôs passed on to a new generation. And this film embodies that ‚ù§‚ù§"
"5021","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-04,"Both the teaser and the trailer are some works of art on their own. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm prepared for how incredible this movie is"
"5022","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-09,"Chadwick Boseman did something incredible. Not only he embodied a king in the MCU, he glazed this light also in the reality. He shares all the aspects of a King. He shined through humbleness, empathy, wisdom and great leadership. His footprints would be hard to scratch off for a long time."
"5023","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-02-15,"Nobody could ever replace BOSEMAN he would always be the black panther.. RIP LEGEND ‚ù§"
"5024","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"This trailer is exactly what we all needed to get hyped. The new Black Panther suit looks insane, so does Iron Heart&#39;s. The cgi looks great, and of course the cinematography is everything I hoped for. I can&#39;t wait for this movie"
"5025","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"That tiny detail of the suit absorbing the impact makes me think they paid a ton of attention to the small things and we will get an amazing story. I love continuity"
"5026","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"All Awesomeness aside.. Can we just agree on how Epic the music and song sound in this. Gave me chills man"
"5027","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Man this is so bittersweet. I know it&#39;s going to be emotional due to Chadwick&#39;s absence, but I believe the rest of the cast is gonna put on an amazing performance for us. Can&#39;t wait to see it!!"
"5028","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-07,"It won&#39;t be the same, but I know they worked so hard to put out this movie. I&#39;ll definitely support it."
"5029","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> I actually kind of love how Namor leaps through the air as if he&#39;s stepping on it. One of the more unique flying abilities as opposed to rockets or straight levitation"
"5030","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-06,"The lines ‚ÄúOnly the most broken people can be good leaders‚Äù, gave me chills, RIP Chadwick Boseman, may your legacy live FOREVER‚ù§"
"5031","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"The fact that they included Chadwick&#39;s death in the story, and made it a core part of the drama, is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie. We all grief Chadwick, and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief. Hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer."
"5032","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-11-13,"LOVED the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, which moved me to tears. I felt his presence throughout the movie. Kudos to the production team and cast for keeping his memory alive!"

"5041","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-02-01,"R.I.P to the king, black panther &amp; the legend will always be missed im watching this movie and the MCU has done him justice and honored him"
"5042","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-04,"The beginning brought me to tears right away. Just seeing Black Panther&#39;s funeral. It hurts me so much. And, I am glad they are taking this movie serious with no goofs, jokes, or silly stuff. And Shuri as the new Black Panther, I am really excited to see it. But we will always remember the truest Black Panther ever. We will always remember Chadwick Boseman. We miss him. And we will never forget him. I bet he&#39;s happy how this movie will turn out and how it&#39;ll honor him"
"5043","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-06,"It‚Äôs the music for me <br>You can even feel the goosebumps on your entire body"
"5044","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"I like how even though the movie appears to be mostly serious, it has some of the zaniness of the source material by keeping the wings on Namor‚Äôs ankles. Also that final shot showing Shuri as the new Black Panther sent chills down my spine."
"5045","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-01-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=101"">1:41</a> this is the most epic scene in the trailer"
"5046","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"The short sequence of Ironheart‚Äôs suit looks and sounds amazing. I‚Äôve always appreciated the sound design of the suits when you can clearly hear the components moving and clicking into place. Very exciting"
"5047","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Been a huge fan of Black Panther since I was a small kid. It&#39;s a real happy feeling inside to see great story tellers honoring the story and characters. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman. Long live Queen Shuri.‚ô•Ô∏è"
"5048","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Hearing Bemba and Nyanja on a Black Panther trailer is such a huge step for the Zambian music scene. Sampa is really redefining the boundaries."
"5049","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-02-24,"I know how i have watched this movie without crying. The moment it started i started to tear up. We miss you chadwick and i still can&#39;t believe you are not with us. Rest in peace king."
"5050","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"This is going to be so emotional. I hope marvel delivers what they&#39;re promising, a beautiful, touching, well done movie as T&#39;challa and Chadwick deserves, not a clown show."
"5051","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-08,"I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of Namor the Submariner. The look Disney gave him in this movie is outstanding. I sincerely love his look."
"5052","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Shuri‚Äôs Panther suit is absolutely beautiful! The gold and silver highlights and the white dots on her face look so good, and make it feel so much like her!"
"5053","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-04-07,"I&#39;m not much of a superhero, comic, marvel, DC type of viewer but I absolutely loved every part of this movie. I really should get into this genre haha. Bloody beautiful and those costumes from both sides...OMG, give the designers several awards"
"5054","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-05,"I think Namor deserves attention as well because he looks epic. He has presence and I love that he doesn&#39;t seem like this factory-manufactured antagonist of recent times. It&#39;s Kingdom vs Kingdom, and the visuals of both cultures and their clash is mesmerizing."
"5055","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Namor looks and moves perfectly! So cool to see him realized in a way that doesn&#39;t make him look like a silly joke."
"5056","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"The soundtrack used for the trailer is Zambian (Sampha The Great ft. Chef 187 x Tio x Mwanje - Never Forget)<br>and it was sang in Nyanja and Bemba. There&#39;s a time around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> where Tio sings<br>&quot;ndiwe mfumu lelo osayibala&quot; <br>these lyrics directly translates to <br>&quot;You&#39;re king now, do not forget (never forget)&quot; which is in direct reference to both Namor&#39;s kingship and Shuri&#39;s ascendance to the Throne!

"5058","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Ryan Coogler has this special ability to really elevate the MCU storytelling. The visuals look gorgeous and you can tell Black Panther 2 is going to have a lot of heart to it. Can‚Äôt wait"
"5059","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"I know I am going to bawl my eyes out with the tribute. I&#39;m so glad they were able to make another movie. Based on the trailer it looks like they will do it justice"
"5060","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"Absolutely beautiful! The music, the visuals, and the dialogue all add up to a great experience. I can&#39;t wait for this emotional rollercoaster of a movie."
"5061","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2023-02-05,"One of the most beautiful trailers I have seen!"
"5062","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"This trailer doesn&#39;t have the crescendo ingredient that the teaser has, but is still a chilling and beautiful trailer. No unnecessary jokes or goofy moments, it&#39;s time for a really good and serious movie"
"5063","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"This movie it‚Äôs gonna be a whole different level, men it‚Äôs so emotional, it‚Äôs clear to see that the cast give their everything"
"5064","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",2022-10-03,"That suit was incredible. Can&#39;t wait to see Shuri as Black Panther!"
"5065","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Nicolas and Nicholas. The duo we never knew we needed."
"5066","Renfield",2023-01-07,"I love that Nicolas Cage always gives 100 percent. It doesn&#39;t matter if the script is gold or complete crap, he knows how to commit and give it his all."
"5067","Renfield",2023-01-05,"What is crazy is he actually looks like he might unironically be a really good Dracula."
"5068","Renfield",2023-02-05,"This is a trailer done right. It doesn‚Äôt give away the plot, doesn‚Äôt show you all the best parts and does what it‚Äôs suppose to do which is get you hyped for the film. I wish more trailers did this."
"5069","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Nicholas Cage as Dracula is one of the best casting choices they ever made."
"5070","Renfield",2023-01-10,"Everyone talking about nick cage, but Nicholas Hoult is also a great talent. Loved him in warm bodies and young beast in X-men franchise."
"5071","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Nicholas Cage is always Nicholas Cage, and he always deliver. The crazier he is the better everything gets. This is going to be a real treat, and he actually seems to be an awesome Count."
"5072","Renfield",2023-01-10,"I love how eating an insect gives him power. In the Bram Stoker book, draculas servant feeds insects to rats and rats to a cat and then eats the cat (or some combination of animals but it starts with insects) bc he says if you eat a creature, you gain it‚Äôs life force. Such a cool way to call back to the original Renfield."
"5073","Renfield",2023-01-24,"I immediately liked how when he said <br>‚Äúcome on in‚Äù <br>he freaked out because that counted as an invitation to come into the building.<br>Old school vampire lore."
"5074","Renfield",2023-01-08,"I admit I always had a soft spot for Mr. Cage but seeing his entrance as Dracula really made me laugh...in a good way. This could really be fun to watch."
"5075","Renfield",2023-02-03,"I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs low budget or high budget. Cage always does a good job acting.    Can‚Äôt wait to see him on top again."
"5076","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Seeing Nic Cage as Dracula puts a smile on my face"
"5077","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This movie is going to be wild no matter how good or bad it is"
"5078","Renfield",2023-01-05,"I always thought Renfield was an underrated character in the book, because there was genuinely depth I felt. But this looks like a fun movie, for sure"
"5079","Renfield",2023-02-26,"Finally, Nick Cage has a role that is perfect for him. There is no way he can over act this part."
"5080","Renfield",2023-01-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmO6rmDW08&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> i love the fact that Dracula is an old style vampire which meant he must get invited to be able to get inside a house"
"5081","Renfield",2023-01-13,"Considering the amount of detail original to the book (spider-eating, Vampires having to be invited, etc) this looks like a really smart movie having the time of its life being as dumb-fun as possible and I am here for it."
"5082","Renfield",2023-01-09,"Nicolas Cage has already proven that he can play a crazy person who thinks they&#39;re a vampire. But to see him play an actual vampire? Absolutely thrilled for this!"
"5083","Renfield",2023-02-07,"I saw this trailer before a YouTube video and had no idea who was playing Dracula. When Nick Cage showed up, I literally started cheering. Perfect casting choice."
"5084","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Nick Cage‚Äôs comeback has honestly been great, can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes"
"5085","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This gonna be fun to watch. Nicolas cage is always at his best when he&#39;s crazy."
"5086","Renfield",2023-01-08,"I&#39;m so excited for this. If you want a Nicholas Cage as a vampire fix until the release of this film, watch The Vampire&#39;s Kiss. It&#39;s an early-career expression of Nicholas Cage being everything you love about Nicholas Cage."
"5087","Renfield",2023-03-05,"Nicholas Cage or Johnny Depp are the few actors that could pull a role like this off. Both give 110% of themselves into their work."
"5088","Renfield",2023-01-10,"I love the part where the counselor invites Dracula in and Reinfeld freaks out. Vampires can supposedly only enter if you give them permission."
"5089","Renfield",2023-01-05,"I love that Niccage embraces his persona in his last few movies."
"5090","Renfield",2023-01-06,"I didnt know I needed a Nicholas Cage Dracula in my life but now that I have it I wont let it go <br><br>This looks batshit insane and I LOVE IT"
"5091","Renfield",2023-03-02,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmO6rmDW08&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> Love how he stops at the threshold because he needs to be invited in!"
"5092","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This looks genuinely great, and Nic looks like he&#39;s having a hell of a lot of fun in his role."
"5093","Renfield",2023-01-05,"I&#39;m running out of words here to explain how excited i am for this movie"
"5094","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Someone tell me why this looks like its gonna be good. Like having Nicholas Hoult&#39;s character be main focus, is actually genius."
"5095","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Nic Cage is such a legend and rocking it in underrated films. Love it"
"5096","Renfield",2023-01-05,"The sequel to Vampire‚Äôs Kiss that we never asked for but always needed."
"5097","Renfield",2023-01-06,"I love the fact that Dracula‚Äôs servant got his own movie, still it‚Äôd be funnier if he was compelled to eat bugs as a character tick and not need them for a power up. Also can‚Äôt wait for my favorite chapter of Dracula getting turned into a whole movie too!!!"
"5098","Renfield",2023-03-22,"I&#39;m looking forward to this movie, I&#39;m a die-hard Dracula fan. I find the idea of a Dracula film from Renfield&#39;s point of view fascinating, as Renfield is often a character that&#39;s not normally taken seriously, but in this film it looks like people are actually listening to him properly"
"5099","Renfield",2023-01-08,"Nicholas Cage and John Malkovich. They are a class apart. When they speak it feels like a song. So excited to be able to watch him on the big screen again."
"5100","Renfield",2023-01-12,"I went to a dracula ballet one time, which means no spoken dialogue or singing for those who have never been to a ballet. It&#39;s like interpretive dance. The Renfield in this ballet was quite literally the BEST depiction of the character I have ever seen. The guys was barrel rolling across the stage and just going wild. It&#39;s hard to explain the dance but it was so perfect. <br><br>It&#39;s about time they gave this character a movie of their own, he is by far one of my favorite side characters in any movie. Dracula Dead and Loving It is one of my favorite movies depicting this character so I hope this one is decent. Not too sure how I feel about them giving him super powers though."
"5101","Renfield",2023-01-06,"This looks incredible! Hoult did so good in Warm Bodies, and Nic Cage is an icon."
"5102","Renfield",2023-03-23,"Nic Cage screaming &quot;I&quot;M A VAMPIRE, I&#39;M A VAMPIRE&quot; in Vampire&#39;s Kiss is one of my fondest memories, and it looks like this film might finally outshine that.<br><br>Also from the writers of Rick and Morty, Community, Invincible and The Walking Dead, and the director of Moral Orel &amp; Lego Batman doing a live action feature. <br>Wow. These guys know how to mix comedy with dark high-concept ideas. I&#39;m excited."
"5103","Renfield",2023-01-06,"This looks incredible"
"5104","Renfield",2023-01-06,"If you haven‚Äôt seen it, ‚ÄúMom and Dad‚Äù is a taste of how good this is gonna be. Cage is just the guy that needs the right vehicle and he‚Äôll give us a classic."
"5105","Renfield",2023-01-05,"My favorite quirk of Dracula was that he needed to be invited into the room to enter. Funny to see them play on this in the meeting scene XD"
"5106","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Oh god I never thought I need this duo but now I can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs going to be good or not, I know I will have a great time watching it"
"5107","Renfield",2023-01-06,"This looks incredible. I checked it out to see if it&#39;s based on a comic or novel (aside from Dracula) and it&#39;s not, it&#39;s an original idea. I&#39;m also glad to see Nicholas Hoult in something big again. I&#39;m just hyped af!"
"5108","Renfield",2023-01-10,"first saw Nicholas Hoult in Skins. He has so much range, it&#39;s incredible, and I think he&#39;s gonna carry this movie. for me, Cage is just the icing on the cake."
"5109","Renfield",2023-01-06,"I couldn&#39;t stop smiling watching this.<br>! I&#39;ve been so excited to see Nic Cage as Dracula since the behind the scenes photos came out months ago!"
"5110","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This looks way better than I originally thought it was going to be. Nic Cage makes an awesome Dracula!"
"5111","Renfield",2023-01-05,"He&#39;s like a more comedic version of Christopher Lee&#39;s Dracula. I&#39;m here for it!"
"5112","Renfield",2023-01-18,"I love the framing of an abusive relationship support group SO MUCH that I want to go out and see this as probably the first movie I&#39;ve seen in a theatre since the pandemic, despite full knowledge that I might annoy everybody by breaking out in hysterical laughter when Dracula does something spooky and all I can think about is him getting mauled by bees."
"5113","Renfield",2023-01-08,"I was already on board from the trailer, but when I saw that Nicholas Cage was playing Dracula?<br><br>Well, this unironically became my most anticipated film of 2023."
"5114","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Nicholas Cage in horror/comedy movies is badassery right there."
"5115","Renfield",2023-01-05,"I&#39;m gonna see this movie, it makes Renfield actually look like a hero instead of a sick man locked in a padded cell."
"5116","Renfield",2023-01-06,"He‚Äôs ACTUALLY doing the Peter from Vampires Kiss voice and I‚Äôm so dead. Protect Nic Cage at all costs"
"5117","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This feels like the role Nicholas Cage was born to play and he literally played himself in a movie last year."
"5118","Renfield",2023-03-28,"When I heard about this movie, I was hoping for a serious, dark, movie with antiquated horror but, I&#39;ll most likely watch it anyway being that Renfield was always one of my favorite characters."
"5119","Renfield",2023-01-05,"I wish that Dracula Untold would get a sequel, but I&#39;m interested in this movie as well."
"5120","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Nicolas Cage as Dracula is just genius."
"5121","Renfield",2023-01-13,"Nicholas Hoult usually portrays such weird characters and I love it!"
"5122","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Finally! Renfield gets the attention he deserves!"
"5123","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Trailer lowkey go hard. Giving me &quot;not gonna do well at box office yet will end up a cult classic&quot; vibes"
"5124","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This role was made for Cage and I‚Äôm all for it!!!"
"5125","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This actually looks way more awesome than if anticipated."
"5126","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This will be the greatest movie ever"
"5127","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Looks really promising, and the eccentric role fits Nicholas Cage perfectly. Can&#39;t wait to see it!"
"5128","Renfield",2023-01-05,"First Wednesday and now Renfield. Two horror comedies that focuses on one character from the source material."
"5129","Renfield",2023-01-07,"Beyond the fact that Nicolas Cage got in deep with the IRS, was essentially taking anything and everything he could get to pay it off, most straight to stream or dvd movies.<br><br>He is a very committed and talented actor. It seems the more the more the role is pushed, the better he is. I think this is going to be great actually, looking forward to seeing it."
"5130","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Finally a movie that makes me want to see it in the theater!"
"5131","Renfield",2023-01-05,"This is going to be great movie. Just like Cocain Bear, Megan, Knock at the Cabin. They have something in common. They are new ideas, embracing old caracters. Not remasters or remakes. Its new, but it uses the old memories, old movies, to caught your attention. With the new ideas this is awesome. Im excited for every movie!"

"5134","Renfield",2023-03-08,"These are the movies we need more of. I feel like over the last decade the only movies getting the spotlight are all superhero movies. Bring back some good plot, horror, action, practical effects. Cgi/vfx for an entire film is meh nowadays! Can&#39;t wait for this!!!!"
"5135","Renfield",2023-01-08,"From being Ghost Rider to becoming Dracula, Johnny almost came to a full circle."
"5136","Renfield",2023-01-05,"When i first heard about this movie i was skeptical but after watching the trailer this changed my mind. It looks really good !"
"5137","Renfield",2023-01-05,"&quot;okay... Obviously we&#39;re dealing with a little bit more than narcissism here&quot;  no matter how bad this is gonna be, I&#39;m finna watch it."
"5138","Renfield",2023-03-22,"I love nicolas cage, because he doesn&#39;t always need to give a daniel day lewis performance. He always finds a way to put 100 percent into his work and entertain his audience. He&#39;s so entertaining to watch."
"5139","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Now this is an interesting and refreshing take on an old story. I&#39;m really excited to see this!"
"5140","Renfield",2023-01-05,"It&#39;s like a Dracula movie brought the new era - Renfield. It&#39;s pretty exciting because of Nicolas Cage. Looking forward for this movie soon!"
"5141","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Ok, this looks freaking awesome!<br>I‚Äôve been interested in this film ever since I found out about it a few years ago, this looks hilarious and it looks like a bloody good time.<br><br>P.S. Nicolas Cage as Dracula looks kinda creepy, I like it."
"5142","Renfield",2023-03-26,"finally a movie to get the monster universe back on its feet."
"5143","Renfield",2023-01-08,"Looks amazing. Definitely can&#39;t wait to c it. Cage has kinda become the master of  turning things into instant cult classics. Especially over the last few years. Definitely excited to c if he can keep it up. Based on this trailer I&#39;m thinking absolutely."
"5144","Renfield",2023-01-10,"Dude I love this line. &#39;Okay, obviously we are getting a little bit more than just a narcissism here.&#39; <br>That was dope ü§£."
"5145","Renfield",2023-01-11,"I wish more people who enjoyed this would read the original Dracula novel by Bram Stoker because it looks and feels like a badass modern retelling of the Dracula story but Cage comes across as a far more sinister and villainous character because he based his performance on Max Schreck&#39;s legendary character of Count Orlok from Nosferatu. I cant wait for this"
"5146","Renfield",2023-01-20,"Nicholas Hoult once being a zombie, now a vampire makes me want to watch the movie even more. Maybe the next monster film will have him as a mummy or werewolf ü§î"
"5147","Renfield",2023-01-06,"This might be a career revival by Nic Cage. He deserves this!"
"5148","Renfield",2023-01-05,"Just glad to see Cage back in films again.‚ù§"
"5149","Renfield",2023-01-06,"The one thing we can count on is Nicolas Cage will deliver. He has his whole career."
"5150","Renfield",2023-01-06,"He honestly seems like he might be a unironically excellent Dracula, which is bizarre."
"5151","Renfield",2023-01-06,"Sir Nicolas is going to above the extreme level üòáüí´<br>The best casting ever in the history üëª"

"5153","The Blind",2023-09-18,"I‚Äôm trying not to bawl like a baby watching this trailer because I‚Äôm where Ms Kay was, fighting for my marriage. I‚Äôve been fighting for over 8 years and fighting in the spirit for my husband to come back to God. It will all be worth it when God comes through and they are an inspiration to me"
"5154","The Blind",2023-06-22,"Oh man, I can‚Äôt wait to see this. I tear up every time I see Phil on his knees and he slams his hand on the ground. I‚Äôve been there my friend. Sometimes the Lord has to get us to a place that we‚Äôll yield and submit to Him. Even in our lowest times, He is faithful."
"5155","The Blind",2023-09-02,"I read Phil&#39;s book, several years ago and hoped someone would see the potential and üò¢would make it a movie. Kay&#39;s faith is what kept the family intact through the hard times, and she deserves a lot of the credit for what the family is today."
"5156","The Blind",2023-09-20,"I CAN NOT wait to see this movie!! The Robertsons are such a great family and their story is so inspirational."
"5157","The Blind",2023-08-29,"My first experience with duck commander was when I was 3; my dad first took me to the duck blind. I was too young to shoot so I was the &quot;designated caller.&quot;<br>We got all the calls I wanted, I watched all VHS tapes of &quot;The Duckmen of Louisiana,&quot; and I had the casettes to play as we drove to the salten sea so I could learn more about the art of calling. Far before Duck Dynasty, I had a strong connection to Phil and the family. And I&#39;m glad Kay and his story is getting told with respect and production value. And one day, I&#39;ll be teaching my daughter how to call just as I did, with the same calls the robertsons always made by hand."
"5158","The Blind",2023-09-03,"I am looking so forward to seeing the movie. Have always loved this family. Yes Miss Kay deserves so much recognition for all she did to fight for her family. A strong woman"

"5165","The Blind",2023-06-30,"I may not be the religious type but i am excited for this movie because like it or not the Robertson&#39;s have had a profound impact on me and taught me values i couldn&#39;t find in my own life."
"5166","The Blind",2023-09-26,"I can&#39;t wait to see it! I&#39;ve been listening to Unashamed for years and know Phil&#39;s story well. Ms Kay is a saint! God, keep blessing the Robertson family!"
"5167","The Blind",2023-09-11,"I have shared with all my friends! I love your family and cannot wait to see it on the big screen.

"5200","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"Jake and his beard, Guy Ritchie and a good supporting cast. Sold."
"5201","The Covenant",2023-02-06,"I like that the story is timeless. One person repaying a life debt to another.  Could set this at any point in human history and it would work."
"5202","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"Gotta give Ritchie immense credit to direct a movie every single year, that is no easy thing!"
"5203","The Covenant",2023-04-12,"I‚Äôm also an Interpreter and have corrected so many people when they call me just a translator. Interpretation is different. You‚Äôre not just translating the message, you‚Äôre conveying it, explaining it, connecting the 2 parties so they feel they really are really talking to each other. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!!"
"5204","The Covenant",2023-02-07,"I think this is a good movie to show how much interpreters did for us in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even if this is some sensationalized story, they put their life on the line for us. Their family&#39;s lives even. People need to understand that these interpreters deserve to be saved."
"5205","The Covenant",2023-02-03,"Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the greatest actors working in Hollywood, and the fact that he has one Oscar nomination with no wins is a CRIME! &quot;Prisoners.&quot; &quot;Nocturnal Animals.&quot; &quot;Nightcrawler.&quot; &quot;Zodiac.&quot; All of those roles at the very least deserved nominations. He&#39;s one of the most versatile actors I&#39;ve ever seen! <br><br>He&#39;s up there with Christian Bale, in my book, but at least Christian has an Oscar and multiple nominations."
"5206","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"Jake Gyllenhaal always kills it and it good to see Anthony Star from the Boys in the big screen. That guy needs more recognition."
"5207","The Covenant",2023-03-16,"There is nothing so pure than sticking to a vow and fulfilling it."
"5208","The Covenant",2023-02-07,"Shameful how we treated these guys who were on the frontlines with our troops after they risked it all to keep our guys safe. Respect from Canada to Ritchie and his crew for telling this story."
"5209","The Covenant",2023-02-06,"It‚Äôs a pity very few know the actual stories this movie is based on, and how  eventually we abandoned and denied help to those who helped us."
"5210","The Covenant",2023-03-12,"There&#39;s a recent article I read about Guy Ritchie and how obsessed he is with the stories/lore/hospitality of the Middle East and how he literally stays living in that region, granted safe countries such as Gulf secure ones such as Emirates, and how he plans on making more films from there. <br><br>Expect him to make more like this is what I&#39;m trying to say I guess"
"5211","The Covenant",2023-02-06,"Now this is what I&#39;m talking about! A proper director, making a proper movie with a proper producer, a proper financer and proper actors! Thank you. Can&#39;t wait!"
"5212","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"I&#39;m a Ritchie fan, so I&#39;ll be catching this one. Looks a little different to his usual, but I bet he knocks it out of the park."
"5213","The Covenant",2023-02-03,"Every time a see the phrase &quot;the academy award nominee Jake Gyllenhaal&quot; I think this brilliant actor hasn&#39;t been nominated enough. He&#39;s so talented and versatile"

"5215","The Covenant",2023-02-09,"Seeing Jake in the army again reminded of Jarhead, what a masterpiece"
"5216","The Covenant",2023-02-04,"Guy Ritchie&#39;s slick comedy/dramas are some of my all-time favorites, but his serious films are on a completely different level. If this is even half as good as Revolver or Wrath of Man, we&#39;ve got a winner on our hands."
"5217","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"This looks good. Solid story line. Someone give Scott Adkins a movie that has a solid story too already"
"5218","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"Happy to see Antony Starr in the big screen!"
"5219","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"Ritchie has been on an absolute tear lately. Him and Gyllenhaal have to make for a great one! The only thing that scares me is this trailer gives away way too much, and movies that do that in a trailer always end up being mediocre."
"5220","The Covenant",2023-02-08,"I love these kinds of grounded movies where the story is focused on two central characters, a breath of fresh air from the convoluted save the world movies."
"5221","The Covenant",2023-02-03,"This looks really good! I&#39;m stoked to see Antony Starr (Homelander) making his way into a high-profile movie like this too."
"5222","The Covenant",2023-03-12,"This is a complete set of live action, drama, brotherhood, and you mention it. Outstandingly remarkable."
"5223","The Covenant",2023-02-09,"I was an interpreter for few years, in combat time, I didn&#39;t drag wounded solders across the mountains but I would like to think that I did a good job! am excited to watch this move"

"5230","The Covenant",2023-02-02,"I wish trailers would last 35 to 40 seconds long...this showed the whole movie"
"5231","The Covenant",2023-02-06,"I am a simple person: I see a Guy Ritchie as a director - I instantly add the movie to watchlist. I love everything about his directing style and vision."
"5232","The Covenant",2023-02-20,"Dar Salim is already one of the biggest actors in Denmark, hopefully this movie will throw his name across to the world."

"5245","The Expendables 4",2023-06-08,"76 years. That is the age of Sylvester Stallone, 76 years, let that sink inn for a moment. To be actually making action movies at that age is one thing , doing it looking the way he does a whole another. To have that muscle mass &amp; physique at that age is quite remarkable. We should all take a moment to truly appreciate  Stallone&#39;s greatness and acknowledge that which  made it all possible, HGH, you are the teams real MVP, thank you"
"5246","The Expendables 4",2023-06-08,"Whenever Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa are involved you just know that it&#39;s going to be a movie like no other. üî•"
"5247","The Expendables 4",2023-06-07,"For those who were wondering, the reason why Terry crews is not in Expendables 4 is because the producer told him to drop the sexual assault case against Adam Venit and he refused and left the film."

"5252","The Expendables 4",2023-06-07,"People forget how legendary Tony Jaa is as an acrobatic martial artist. Still, nothing drops my draw like half the scenes in Protector and Ong Bak. Seeing him run up a glass wall and perform Muy Thai on hundreds on gangsters still blows my mind. He&#39;s probably one of the most talented martial artists to date in cinema. Expendables is cool and all, but gun action and big explosions still don&#39;t measure up to good fight choreography and real stunts. Sucks Jackie Chan isnt&#39; in on this, but he&#39;s still one of the all-time greats."
"5253","The Expendables 4",2023-08-08,"The great thing about the Expendable franchise is that it doesn&#39;t ever have to die. There&#39;s always going to be action stars past their prime to do these movies."
"5254","The Expendables 4",2023-06-07,"Just give Tony Jaa and Iko a 2 hour fight scene and I&#39;ll watch it"
"5255","The Expendables 4",2023-06-07,"Ong Bak and The Raid are incredible action films. So adding stars Tony Jaa &amp; Iko Uwais from the said films are massive wins"

"5257","The Expendables 4",2023-06-09,"Can I be the one to say that I love 50cents acting career. He just wants to make action movies and have fun doing it, even if his acting isnt always the greatest i respect him for just having some fun by doing them."
"5258","The Expendables 4",2023-06-09,"Whenever there is a movie with Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, you know damn well the movie is going to be an absolutely epic win!"
"5259","The Expendables 4",2023-06-15,"These old school type of action films hold a special place in my heart, cos there‚Äôll be a time when they don‚Äôt exist anymore. Newer ‚Äúaction‚Äù films try to be too deep and poetic, the expendables franchise is just good ol‚Äô ass-kicking and badassery, and that‚Äôs all it needs to be."
"5260","The Expendables 4",2023-06-07,"Alright guys so we&#39;ve got Tony Jaa and Iko Uwais in the film so let&#39;s make sure we give the majority of the fight scenes to Megan Fox."

"5313","Champions",2023-02-23,"This looks like it could be a legitimately good movie. It doesnt look to be pandering, or meant to make you feel bad because of their difficulties. It treats them as people and Woody Harrelson, was an excellent choice!"

"5366","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"Somebody needs to give Zac that He-man role ASAP."
"5367","The Iron Claw",2023-10-26,"I grew up in Burleson, Texas in the 70s and 80s. I can tell you with 100% certainty, the Von Erichs were god-like there. Whoever is picking the material for A24 deserves a promotion. This is going to be heavy ... whether you know their story or not."
"5368","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"Feels so odd being so hyped for a movie that is going to be very depresssing"
"5369","The Iron Claw",2023-10-14,"A24 does better quality movies than 90% from all other Hollywood entertainment companies."
"5370","The Iron Claw",2023-12-03,"Zac Efron is really (pleasantly) surprising me with his choices the past few years. This juicy role will give his acting talent a real chance to shine again. I hope he‚Äôs  properly recognized for it"
"5371","The Iron Claw",2023-10-13,"Kinda crazy how zac efron was pretty much the only one to be super successful in the movie industry out of all the cast of high school musical. Insanely talented. Kudos to him."
"5372","The Iron Claw",2023-12-15,"I was 17 and worked security for Will Rodgers Coliseum in Fort Worth where they wrestled every Monday night. The Von Erichs were our heroes. It was like walking next to Superman. It was my job for a time to carry the wrestler&#39;s clothes and props to the back. I would even get to help a wrestler from time to time. I got to appear in the opening (3 seconds.lol) of the Highlander movie. It was a magic. I was the kid that got to carry Superman&#39;s cape. Thank you, Von Erichs."
"5373","The Iron Claw",2023-10-12,"If you&#39;ve never heard of the Von Erich family, I suggest looking into their story before seeing this film if you&#39;re faint of heart because it&#39;s legit one of the most gut wrenching and tragic stories you&#39;ll ever read. Just be prepared if you plan on seeing this."
"5374","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"Along with 2008‚Äôs The Wrestler, seeing what these performers go through and the sacrifices they make in the name of entertainment is something. I hope by watching movies like this, people begin to respect these athletes. <br><br>I‚Äôm stoked for this one."
"5375","The Iron Claw",2023-10-12,"A24 killing it AGAIN. This looks phenomenal. As a pro wrestling fan I‚Äôve been waiting so long for a movie like this. Hope it wins an Oscar."

"5378","The Iron Claw",2023-10-19,"As a huge old-school wrestling and Kerry Von Erich fan, I&#39;m so excited for this movie. It looks so well made and I know how tragic the cursed life of the Von Erich&#39;s was, so this will make for a deep and powerful rollercoaster of a film."
"5379","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"I just learned about the Von Erich family and the tragedies that they have endured over the years, this film is gonna hit me so hard. The cast looks incredible. Can‚Äôt wait to watch the film!"
"5380","The Iron Claw",2023-10-15,"A24 is rising the ranks of hollywood with really good quality movies while also letting creators do their things and paying everyone equally for the work they did."

"5382","The Iron Claw",2023-10-20,"For the VERY FIRST TIME in my life, I have a movie that I can see in the theater with my Uncle who introduced me to wrestling in 1991 when I was just 4 years old. He always told me stories about the Von Erichs and the Fabulous Freebirds rivalry and now after 32 years, we finally have our own movie to go see together and his health is on the decline pretty badly so I‚Äôm very happy to be able to share this moment with him. üôèüôèüôè"
"5383","The Iron Claw",2023-11-22,"i really love that shot at the start where hes going back and forth between the ropes. that building of tension is incredible."
"5384","The Iron Claw",2023-10-13,"I&#39;m so proud of Zac. He&#39;s really come a long way since his Disney days. I hope he&#39;s still acting when he&#39;s 70. I see a few Oscars under his belt before he retires."
"5385","The Iron Claw",2023-10-20,"There&#39;s just something about A24 films that really draw my attention. It&#39;s not simply the pure\raw ideas and adaptions but the video quality of it all. Truly something pure and magnificent. I legit wouldn&#39;t have a second thought if they had their own streaming service no matter the cost."
"5386","The Iron Claw",2023-10-13,"This movie is going to be one of the most tragic wrestling stories to be shown for big audiences. As a wrestling superfan, the von Erich story is not about a curse, it&#39;s just about the unity of brothers who got into the wrestling business by a legendary but tough father who controlled them and broke them down to turn them into wrestling superstars in Texas, for WCCW (World Class Championship Wrestling). I hope that the story will be very truthful and respectful to the Von Erichs, but show the actual horrible truth about their struggles with depression, drug addiction, and just breaking their bodies and minds to keep WCCW successful by their father, but soon with all of it, all the brothers, except for Kevin, would be dead by their own addiction or by their own hands due to what they went through. So far, the movie looks good, Zac Efron looks a bit weird cast for Kevin Von Erich, but to be honest, movies shouldn&#39;t cast people for looks, but only for their acting chops, so I just hope Zac will do Kevin Von Erich right, but everyone else looks good enough for their respected roles. I&#39;m praying that the movie is great because I think Wrestling should be told more in Movies, like what the wrestler was or now The Iron Claw, I think the wrestling business is very dramatic and eventful for a movie, but yet has very awful, tragic stories that could be a good portrayal for a movie. I hope it does well."
"5387","The Iron Claw",2023-10-16,"One of the most gifted and talented families in the history of wrestling. A story which needs to be told and will do extreme justice to the name."
"5388","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"I was already hyped for the cast, but Holt McCallany as the Dad made this a must-see for me! I miss Mindhunter so much!"
"5389","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"For wrestling fans we know just how hard this is gonna hit<br><br>For non-wrestling fans, oh boy get ready‚Ä¶"
"5390","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"Once i heard &quot;People said our family was cursed&quot;, I knew it about the Von Erichs! One of the saddest stories about one of the most talented families in wrestling. My Grandma once said that they were &quot;Simply the FINEST men she had ever laid eyes on&quot;."
"5391","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"I‚Äôm a kid of the 80s and I remember them ‚Äì they were huge ‚Äì they‚Äôre still talked about as being some of the best. There‚Äôs only one of them left now ‚Äì terrible tragedy hit that family. I can‚Äôt wait to see this."
"5392","The Iron Claw",2023-11-27,"That &quot;I told you to look out for him&quot; had to be fritz yelling at Kevin over one of the other brothers death. The emotion and anger in that one line is fantastic. Im prepared to cry that night"

"5394","The Iron Claw",2023-10-13,"Dude, give a raise to whoever put this trailer together ! This was phenomenal! Hyped for this movie."
"5395","The Iron Claw",2023-10-11,"i cannot express how much this movie means to me,i grew up watching these brothers mourned the yellow rose of texas,cheered kerrys championship win over the nature boy,watched every match they had with the freebirds,wccw was our religion, i cannot wait,but as excited as i am,i know its going to be ruff to relive it,the good and the bad,we were young happy care free,and their love for each other made me and my bros bond stronger,thank u and god bless the von erichs"

Reminds me of early feelings I got about &quot;Everything, Everywhere, All At Once&quot; before its release."
"5406","The Iron Claw",2023-10-12,"I&#39;m not huge on wrestling, but I have good friends that love it. You don&#39;t need to love wrestling to appreciate this story, and based on the trailer, the execution of bringing it to life will make it that much better. I can&#39;t wait for this film."

I never really knew too much about the Von Erich&#39;s growing up but I watched the Dark Side Of The Ring episode about their family and  it was brutal.

"5446","Titanic25 Year Anniversary",2023-01-15,"So many things came together to make this movie as memorable and iconic as it is. Sure, every few years, a studio or two throw a ton of money at a project to realize never-before-seen VFX and large set pieces, massive scenes with 100s or even 1000s of extras, and as much spectacle as money can buy. But ultimately Titanic worked so well, and it‚Äôs no small credit to how earnest Leo and Kate were with their performances, the many incredibly moving moments they share, and what an incredible score.<br>Nothing has ever come close."

"5450","Titanic25 Year Anniversary",2023-01-19,"Hands down one of the all time greatest films ever made and it&#39;s my personal favorite. I saw it in the theater when it first came out in 1997 and it changed my life. I became a filmmaker because of this film. I never get tired of this film."
"5451","Titanic25 Year Anniversary",2023-01-11,"Simply the greatest masterpiece of all time, a grandiose film. Timeless romantic epic such as Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Doctor Zhivago and The Bridges of Madison County. One of the last super productions that linked gigantic scenarios with VFX, making you not know how to distinguish the real from the special effect. A set 10% smaller than the real ocean liner of 1912, which literally sank afterwards for the sinking scenes, a true absurdity even for current times. James Cameron gave his all to Titanic, and he was rewarded with this box office and pop culture phenomenon. This is cinema!<br><br>The sequence with the breaking of the glass dome of the Grand Staircase until the appearance of the ship&#39;s propellers, including the track A Building Panic, is one of the greatest in cinema. Every detail of the sets, figurines, makeup... Everything is unforgettable. The soundtrack composed by the late James Horner will echo for centuries, a real painting that gives the final touch to the work. Sissel&#39;s vocals in the opening and final scene of the film are impressive, a mix of emotions without using any words. A waltz that takes you to different places and memories of different times.<br><br>Film of my life, giving birth to my passion for cinema and the history of the RMS Titanic. No lie, watched about 500 times. Including a VHS broken from rewinding so much, the second part. Today there are editions on VHS, DVD and BD from other countries, as well as soundtrack CDs and games, including books, magazines, newspaper clippings, models and memorabilia in general. True fanaticism!<br><br>I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen in the 2012 3D re-release, now I can experience that unique feeling again. Screening in the cinema is completely different from everything else, do not miss such an opportunity. When I went to watch it in another city, I got a giant display. Brought inside the car, great adventure.<br><br>Even with strong and famous franchises of superheroes, science fiction and animations, Titanic continues as the third highest grossing in the history of cinema. Unbelievable, given what it grossed in its initial run in 1997. First film to break the billion mark, and the second to reach $ 2 billion. It should lose the position to Avatar: The Way of the Water, showing that James Cameron is James Cameron!<br>Theaters sold out for days, people watching on the steps of cinemas, C√©line Dion all day long on the radio, waiting lists to get the tapes rented at video stores, books and magazines in piles on newsstands, special programs on TV, explosive audience on HBO and NBC, 11 Academy Awards, several accolades...<br><br>Titanic isn&#39;t just an event, it&#39;s THE EVENT!"

However, researchers like Roaring Kitty (the protagonist of this movie) and Michael Burry (the guy who predicted the 2008 Market Crash and was the first to short the housing market) figured out that GameStop had a lot more going for it fundamentally, and that it was being way over-shorted. So, when they went in and showed others why, eventually enough people got in and the rest is history."

"5647","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-07-10,"The fact that this got an R rating, has me highly optimistic."
"5648","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-04-18,"Finally, a movie about the Demeter when Dracula was on board killing the crew. I always thought that one small part of the Dracula novel was worth expanding.<br><br>Edit<br><br>For example, this short story and prequel to Dracula by Bram Stoker, was originally supposed to be a part of the novel. But Stoker cut it out for some reason. It&#39;s about when Harker first arrives in Transylvania during Walpurgisnacht and all the weird and creepy things he sees. And ironically, Dracula had to save him by paying off a group of soldiers. Because he knew that Harker would be stupid enough to not believe in the legends or stories. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6UbOlAJCEg"">https://youtu.be/V6UbOlAJCEg</a><br><br>Enjoy, for me this is the best rendition of Dracula&#39;s Guest there is on YouTube. The narration is superb. As is the sound effects. I listen to it every May Day of every year."
"5649","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-04-13,"I honestly never understood how Dracula wasn‚Äôt forced to slaughter the whole crew almost immediately.  Assuming sunlight actually kept him locked in the crates/coffins, why didn‚Äôt the crew find him within a week tops?  The best answer I have is that sunlight <b>didn‚Äôt</b> cage him in the crates and he was possibly posing as a member of the crew."
"5650","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-04-14,"I watched this going, &quot;Oh, so it&#39;s kinda like that time they shipped Dracula to England and everything went crazy,&quot; and then realized, yes, it&#39;s exactly that XD<br>Didn&#39;t see the description!"
"5651","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-08-04,"would love to see more dracula oneshots come out of this. like, there&#39;s a fair few threads you could follow without bringing in/even naming the main players, right? the zookeeper and his poor escaped wolf; the well-meaning residents of whitby and the mysterious dog. the men who are contracted to move/harbour dracula&#39;s grave soil once it gets to england? the emergency crew he hires to rush him back to transylvania? that last one has potential as a sequel to this, for sure"
"5652","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-08-10,"I think it would&#39;ve been way more effective if they didn&#39;t reveal Dracula&#39;s design until it was actually released in theaters.

"5665","The Last Voyage of the Demeter",2023-04-20,"This looks a hell of a lot better than Renfield, plus it&#39;s actually somewhat sticking to the source material.<br><br>The one gripe I have is that this version of Dracula is that he turned into a  giant bat like he was in the Gary oldman film, instead of just an old man going around killing people. BUT, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll still enjoy the movie regardless. <br><br>To be fair, there was the hint that he could take on other shapes, at least in the book (or maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t remember, it&#39;s been a while since I read the book, I&#39;ll have to re read it again)"

That being said, I wish they went hard monster horror. This is basically alien. It&#39;s a bunch of people, stuck on a ship with a monster that&#39;s killing them, and seemingly is impossible to kill. I wish they didn&#39;t show us dracula, not till the like hundred and five minutes mark. Every trailer is filled with gratuitous shots of the vampire. We all know what vampires look like. Keep it mysterious. Look at midnight mass, the perfect example. Not a single shot of the vampire in any trailers, and we didn&#39;t get to see him till like episode 6 of 8. I was hyped having watched the trailers and I didn&#39;t even know it was going to be about vampires till like two episodes in. <br><br>I&#39;m still hyped we&#39;re getting a dracula movie. I fucking love hard capital R Romance era vampire stories, and it&#39;s been a while since we got one in theaters."

"5772","The Whale",2022-12-14,"This is gonna be an absolute tear-jerker. Branden Fraser will be the Hollywood Comeback story for next 12 months for sure."
"5773","The Whale",2022-12-18,"If Brendan Fraser wins an Oscar for this acting, I&#39;ll cry my heart out. He really made my childhood awesome."
"5774","The Whale",2023-03-13,"I came back to watch this again now that Brendan has officially WON HIS OSCAR FOR BEST ACTOR!!! Im legit so happy i actually choked up seeing him accept his award! he deserved it for this role! WE LOVE YOU BRENDAN CONGRATS!!!"
"5775","The Whale",2022-12-15,"As many are saying... This is the first time I&#39;ve cried in a trailer too... It&#39;s great to see Brendan Fraser back... And this really looks like it&#39;s going to be his best performance ever"
"5776","The Whale",2022-12-16,"Brendan Fraser was one of my favorite actors growing up and after seeing all he went through in his life it felt like watching your hero fall. That last line he delivered really got to me. I hope he gets so many good things coming his way."
"5777","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I had an emotional breakdown 7 years ago. Hearing Brendan say &quot;I need to know I&#39;ve done one thing right in my life&quot; made me have memories pouring in of that time in my life. I felt very similar feelings, thinking I&#39;d done nothing, and will never do anything. This movie is going to be a rollercoaster that I hope I&#39;m ready to ride."
"5778","The Whale",2023-03-23,"I just finished this movie and I cried so much after it was over. It takes you somewhere. It&#39;s bleak but not in a bad way, it&#39;s not commercial, it wouldn&#39;t be everyone&#39;s cups of tea but it&#39;s honest, raw and so damn deep!! I&#39;m so glad that Brandon frazier is back, he deserves the world!"
"5779","The Whale",2022-12-16,"&quot;I need to know I have done one thing right with my life.&quot; My God, the feels it gave me. Touched all the strings in my heart. Someone who suffers from depression knows that feeling and Brendan delivers it. I cannot wait to see this film, but I know its going to tear me up."
"5780","The Whale",2022-12-17,"I had the privilege of watching this film in a film festival and it was one of the best feelings in the world. I was crying from the beginning to the end and I had to remove my tshirt after the show because the neck part was literally soaking with tears. The way Brendan resonates with his character and ultimately the audience is just beautiful.<br>This is undoubtedly the best movie I&#39;ve watched in a while."
"5781","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I can‚Äôt explain how happy I am for this man. He‚Äôs the only famous person I‚Äôd just hug and tell him he‚Äôs a great human being, and I don‚Äôt even personally know him. I am so, truly, fully happy for this man and I hope so much that he‚Äôs happy and in a great place mentally. He deserves the very best life has to offer."

"5787","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I don&#39;t really cry for movies but Fraser just saying &quot;I Need to know I have done one thing right with my life&quot;, and the way he acted in just that brief scene had me in tears... I am not emotionally ready for this. Darren Aronofsky knows how to direct an Oscar Worthy performance"
"5788","The Whale",2022-12-14,"&quot;I need to know I&#39;ve done one thing right in my life.&quot;<br><br>An emotion, I think everyone can relate to"

"5792","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I‚Äôve been destroyed by great movies before, but this might be the first time a trailer tears me up from the inside out. All the best to Brendan Fraser, he deserves it and in his humility has put in the work to also earn it."

"5795","The Whale",2022-12-19,"I gotta admit something, I weigh 400 plus pounds and seeing this trailer makes me cry so damn hard. To feel all alone in a room surrounded by people who love you. The constant reassurance that youre doing something right! The need to make people happy above yourself are feelings that I know all to well. To anyone dealing with the feelings, I want you to know that youbare not alone. You may not know it but someone depends on you, that person...needs you in their life. YOU ARE IMPORTANT! YOU FUCKING MATTER!!! Dont let anyone ever tell you differently. I may not have achieved much in my life but if this message touches just a single soul and motivates that soul to chase their dreams....then I know Ive achieved my purpose. I love you all"
"5796","The Whale",2022-12-15,"We‚Äôve had ‚ÄòBrendan Fraser Week‚Äù, watching all the older films, leading up to seeing this. One of the most underrated actors of all time.

Well done, Brendan Fraser. Glad you&#39;re back in the spotlight."

"5800","The Whale",2022-12-14,"Wow, the detail in the beginning where everybody&#39;s screen is on except for Charlie who&#39;s the instructor, is interesting. the way every single person feels so humane and relatable is great. I&#39;m also invested in knowing more about the relationship of charlie and his nurse. to be able to inject a bit of lightheartedness with a playful joke in between then deliver a gut wrenching line in the end, only Brendan Fraser could&#39;ve done so. He&#39;s just so perfect for the role. I can&#39;t wait for Dec 21 and bawl my eyes out"
"5801","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I love the meaningful roles Sadie has been auditioning for and challenging herself with. She&#39;s one of the most talented / Versatile young actresses in the industry and these roles have definitely taken her out of the shadow of her stranger things cast members. She&#39;s brilliant."
"5802","The Whale",2023-09-26,"‚ÄúI need to know that I have done one thing right with my life‚Äù that was iconic. He nailed the entire role but that line, he acted that out phenomenally. I‚Äôm really glad he won an Oscar for this film. He honestly really deserved it."

"5809","The Whale",2023-01-08,"As the reviews are saying, this is the most convincing and real performance anyone in Hollywood has ever pulled off. The whole theater was bawling their eyes out when the movie ended. All the tears dropped were the proof of what makes us human beings. The ability to cry after watching a man like all of us, struggling with the cruel and full of adversities thing we call existence"
"5810","The Whale",2023-03-15,"That last line,when he was crying. Came from his heart. So damn proud of him..."

"5812","The Whale",2022-12-14,"This looks really good and pretty heartbreaking. I can&#39;t wait to see Brendan give the performance of a lifetime."
"5813","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I don&#39;t think Brendan was even acting when he said &quot;I need to know that I have done one thing right with my life.&quot; That came straight from the heart. Had me in tears man."
"5814","The Whale",2023-03-14,"Never has a movie torn me up emotionally and made me cry the way this one did. Absolutely brilliant."
"5815","The Whale",2022-12-26,"People don‚Äôt understand how good of an actor you have to be to be able to cry on cue and pull your heart strings. Brenden Frazier is truly gifted."
"5816","The Whale",2022-12-15,"That last line brought me to tears. The whole trailer shows his passion for his craft. I cannot wait to see this."
"5817","The Whale",2022-12-15,"The closing scene in this trailer is Oscar worthy. Made me cry instantly, couldn‚Äôt even catch myself. I‚Äôm so happy to see Brenden back and thriving ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"5818","The Whale",2023-03-13,"So happy he won the Oscar especially after all that he&#39;s been through.<br>I, think we all want to know we&#39;ve done something right in our lives. Even if that one thing is very small. We all need that kind of connection."
"5819","The Whale",2022-12-16,"It took only <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWiQodhMvz4&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> to have me in tears. I hope Brendan Fraser does win an Oscar for this film!"
"5820","The Whale",2022-12-14,"Never have I been this floored at a performance from a trailer where I‚Äôm brought to tears. This is the first trailer to do that, so Brendan Fraser is going to win the Oscar. He deserves it!"
"5821","The Whale",2023-03-03,"Believe the hype. I‚Äôm an action and comedy guy. The wife asked me to watch it with her and I begrudgingly said yes, as I‚Äôam cheering for Brendan Fraser. This film and a number of performances within it, are outstanding. Completely exceeded my expectations and my wife‚Äôs. The Oscars are a joke, and regardless if this film doesn‚Äôt take home multiple awards, it is my new favourite film."
"5822","The Whale",2023-04-03,"I watched it and cried buckets, from beginning to end! I didn&#39;t think Brendan Fraser had it in him to play a dramatic role like this with such tenderness and respect but he blew me away.<br>The whole Cast is amazing and I am happy that Brendan received an Oscar for this masterpiece.A lifetime achievement as actor and human being."
"5823","The Whale",2023-01-18,"New dad here, with my own personal struggles, and I have to say this speech at the end of this trailer absolutely slays me. Literally ugly crying. My daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and these words hit so close to home. I needed this."
"5824","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I remember when A24 was still an &quot;indie&quot; movie studio (not the book definition, but more of the adaptive terminology we created over the years to describe something that isn&#39;t main stream). I&#39;m so glad they still give these artists the freedom they want to make these unique art pieces, despite their rise in popularity. Some hit, some miss. I&#39;m just glad, amongst other indie film makers, that these unique stories are able to manifest and exist."
"5825","The Whale",2022-12-15,"What a wonderful trailer! You can feel the emotional vibes to it. The part hit me when he said, &quot;I need to know that I have done one thing right with my life!&quot; I hope with all of our prayers that Brendan Fraser gets an Oscar. He deserves it!"
"5826","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I have never cried from a movie trailer until just now. It caught me off guard and seems so genuine."
"5827","The Whale",2022-12-15,"The last line by Brandan really put me in tears, god. Just for that scene he needs the Oscar"
"5828","The Whale",2023-09-08,"Brendan has always been a pleasure to watch on screen, for his good looks of course and because he&#39;s Canadian,  but also for the delight  of his smooth , intuitive acting.<br><br>I just finished watching The Whale and can&#39;t stop crying. The performances all round were top of the line. The whole movie is shot basically in one room with very few props. It rests entirely  on the riviting  portrayal of its central characters, and it succeeds in spades!<br>Definatel Oscar material and I&#39;m so happy for Brendan&#39;s win.<br>I only hope I can stop crying before the night is over."
"5829","The Whale",2022-12-30,"Have already watched this movie twice and props to all the actors, Brendan especially. It definitely left an impact on me in trying to see the humanity in others and it had me in tears throughout. He deserves all the praise and awards for this amazing piece of work and I am here for the Brenaissance. Protect this gem of a man at all costs!"
"5830","The Whale",2022-12-15,"That last line hits hard! Fraser deserves all the recognition he&#39;s getting. Not just because he&#39;s back in the spotlight... but because this, is a staggering performance."
"5831","The Whale",2022-12-15,"Since I was 6 years old, Encino Man has been my all-time favorite movie. Brendan Fraser makes this movie. It is absolutely surreal to see him today, making his comeback. It‚Äôs also sad that he ever had to make a comeback. But stars will always find a way to shine. They couldn‚Äôt hold Brendan back. No one can. I just want to give this man a hug and a handshake and let him know that he‚Äôs an amazing man and he deserves everything positive coming his way. This is the Hollywood story we all need."
"5832","The Whale",2023-03-13,"I was thinking and talking about Brendan&#39;s talent and potential for more than 10 years, couldn&#39;t be more happy for him. He finally gets what he&#39;s always deserved."
"5833","The Whale",2022-12-18,"Just comes to show how much of a talent Brendan is. He has always been one of my favourite actors growing up."
"5834","The Whale",2022-12-15,"‚ÄúI need to know I did One Thing Right With My Life!‚Äù <br><br>That line hit me hard, as i can currently relate to it since my whole life to this day, feels just similar and I‚Äôm already in tears.<br><br>The way he delivered it spoke to the very soul."
"5835","The Whale",2022-12-15,"Like everyone already said, that closing scene is soul crushing. Brendan&#39;s performance is gonna be incredible, i can feel it."
"5836","The Whale",2023-07-26,"I cried the whole movie. This was just one of the most incredible things i&#39;ve ever seen."
"5837","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I&#39;m really interested in this one. For someone who grew up seeing Brendan in fast paced action films, it&#39;s good to see him succeed in more dramatic territory. He deserves it."
"5838","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I&#39;m gonna have to wait for this to come out on Blu-ray. I don&#39;t know if I can handle the humiliation of ugly sobbing on a floor covered in popcorn and two year old sour patch kids.<br><br>But on a serious note I can already tell this movie is going to destroy me. But seeing Brendan Fraser acting again makes me so unbelievably happy. You can tell he is putting everything he has been through into this performance. So proud of him‚ù§Ô∏è"
"5839","The Whale",2023-01-02,"&quot;Who would want me to be a part of their Life?&quot; <br>That line Broke my heart. He made me Cry. I am a man who never cries. Give him the Oscar!"
"5840","The Whale",2022-12-18,"So happy to see Brendan back.  I grew up with him as the lead actor in almost all of my favorite movies, and seeing his return made me realise how much I missed him despite having never met him.  Truly a wonderful man."
"5841","The Whale",2023-01-01,"The best acting I have ever seen in my entire life. The performance was so moving that the audience literally sat in their seats in awe of what they just experienced when the credits rolled. It is such an incredible shame that the film is not being shown widespread. I live near Chicago and had to drive 40 minutes to get to a theatre showing it. It was well worth it."
"5842","The Whale",2022-12-14,"God this got me so emotional. The character Brendan Frasier is playing is basically my father. He is also a very big guy but has just as big a heart. Watching this trailer, it reminded me of him and how his connection with me and other people has led him to keep going. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna be ready for this movie"
"5843","The Whale",2023-03-06,"I am so happy to see Fraser has made a huge comeback and he is choosing to do projects that really matter.  We can all learn from his humility."
"5844","The Whale",2022-12-15,"Brendan Fraser, you are a gift to all mankind. We don‚Äôt deserve you but we‚Äôre grateful you‚Äôre here. I cannot even begin to explain how much you were a huge part of my childhood. Rick O‚ÄôConnell was easily one of the coolest film characters in the action/adventure genre and there is not one actor that could‚Äôve played him as awesome as you did. I‚Äôve seen all the curveballs life had thrown your way and undeservedly so. It saddens me to see the way Hollywood treated you but words cannot express the joy I feel in seeing you make a comeback. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"5845","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I love Brendan Fraser. If you love him too, please support the film and go see it! BRAVO A24! I can‚Äôt wait for the amazing physical media that will come out with this film!"
"5846","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I&#39;ve been a Brendan Fraser fan for 30 years. He&#39;s a remarkable actor. If he doesn&#39;t win an Oscar for this movie, I&#39;d be very surprised."
"5847","The Whale",2023-03-17,"Brendon absolutely deserved the Oscar. Hats off to the director, writer and the whole team for making such an absolutely stunning and emotionally moving MASTERPIECE OF A MOVIE."
"5848","The Whale",2022-12-19,"Oh my god, just having the video paused where he says that last line and scrolling back up to look at it sends me back into bawling my eyes out. This might be the best acting I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. This is the proof people need that you can do the finest and most influential work of your life... literally whenever you decide to do it. I want this to inspire that in everyone."
"5849","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I literally cried just from the trailer alone. My boy brandon... how can you not love him."
"5850","The Whale",2023-01-08,"The aspect ratio of this movie really illustrated how confined Charlie is in his apartment and his body.  The way the actors delivered lines, you could feel the pain their words inflicted on the characters.  There is a lot of heart, pain, and suffering in this movie, but Brenden delivers a performance that reminded me one must have hope that somehow we need to try and correct mistakes and try to repair things.  This was a fantastic movie from the actors, the writers, the director, the directos of photography, lighting, sound engineers, and the set designers.  There was no BS in this movie."
"5851","The Whale",2023-03-13,"Branden Fraser has won an Oscar people!! This is a day that will certainly go down in history. I fell in love with him in the mummy when I was a little kid and then he disappeared off the face of the earth. For him to win an Oscar for best actor for his comeback film is amazing to say the least."
"5852","The Whale",2022-12-14,"God this gives me chills. Brendan&#39;s performance, along with Sadie&#39;s, it works so well. I cannot wait to see this"
"5853","The Whale",2022-12-14,"Amazing how a predominantly comedic actor like Fraser is so good in being so amazingly dramatic, yet in a genuinely human way.<br>Also, it is surprising to see Darren Aronofsky filming a drama movie, but you can still see his focus on human existentialism, although this time there is less dread in it (Requiem to a dream, black swan, mother) and more hope (like the fountain)"
"5854","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I‚Äôm going to cry my eyes out. The way I hear and watch him say ‚ÄúI need to know that I‚Äôve done one thing right in my life‚Äù puts a feeling in my heart that makes me relate to this in some way and makes me think of a lot of my family members. This is going to be a masterpiece."
"5855","The Whale",2023-03-14,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWiQodhMvz4&amp;t=90"">1:30</a><br>Alone this scene was strong enough to get him the Oscar. Many of us can relate to a line that was astonishingly delivered by Brendan with emotions and a fantastic performance! Truly a masterpiece film. Congrats on the Oscar."
"5856","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I was completely floored by Brendan Fraser&#39;s performance; it&#39;s certainly going to be his magnum opus. I bawled (along with the entire theater) in the last few minutes of the film. Unforgettable movie."
"5857","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I&#39;ve never had a movie TRAILER hit me this hard, the amount of emotion in a 2 minute clip is unreal."
"5858","The Whale",2022-12-14,"I started crying at the scene where Brendan Fraser&#39;s character is giving a motivational speech to young, good-looking people on screen with his camera off."
"5859","The Whale",2022-12-18,"It&#39;s actually amazing to hear how many people were affected by the very last line of this trailer. Incredible acting!"
"5860","The Whale",2022-12-17,"Brandan Fraser has the kindest and warmest eyes, you just cant help but be drawn in by his performance and expressions. Every time I see him on screen I am moved."
"5861","The Whale",2022-12-14,"How does a trailer make you literally well up with tears? Brendan Fraser just killed me with that delivery !"
"5862","The Whale",2023-03-27,"Haven&#39;t seen the film yet, but Brendan was a pivotal part of a lot of people&#39;s childhoods. From starring in classic films like George of the Jungle and the Mummy franchise. Truly grateful to see him back on the big screen again. A true legend of the film industry"
"5863","The Whale",2022-12-15,"I&#39;m really interested in this one."
"5864","The Whale",2022-12-17,"Seeing Brendan feels like reconnecting with an old forgotten best friend. Not to mention that Darren is my absolute favorite director. Honestly cannot wait for this, way to go Brendan, love you buddy! &lt;3"

You can&#39;t forced someone to shift because it doesn&#39;t work like that since it&#39;s somebody&#39;s choice to shift, not you forcing them to shift to a different reality. There&#39;s no way it can work like that.<br>2. Us shifters don&#39;t disappear when shifting to a different reality. Our physical body stays while we only move our consciousness in someone else&#39;s body in a different reality.<br>3. And no, there is no shifitng police. You can&#39;t get arrested for shifting because we are powerful enough to shift, even if we get caught for shifitng realities, it&#39;s not like the shifting police can stop us. We still have the power to shift. Also, the whole shifitng police thing is a whole inside joke in the shifting community.<br><br>Please, do some careful research on shifting because spreading misinformation is going to cause a huge messes in our community. Such as anti-shifters, demotivating shifters, hates, etc. Us shifters wouldn&#39;t want a movie that gave us bad representations about shifting. You could&#39;ve at least hire an experienced shifter to write for the movie, instead of grabbing pieces of misinformation on untrusted media. Thank you for taking your time on reading this."

"6097","After Death",2023-10-08,"Yep, I keep trying to explain to atheists, Christians who only follow the Bible, and anyone that NDE&#39;s are real.  There&#39;s been 100&#39;s of millions of NDE&#39;s that have occurred to people over the last 2400 years.  One of the earliest of note is the &quot;Story of Er&quot; (Plato talked about this) about a soldier who died in battle and was laying on a funeral pyre for TEN DAYS.  His body didn&#39;t decompose like the other corpses did around him.  People witnessed this, then after 10 days, he sat up suddenly and walked away.  He spoke of his experience he witnessed and was sent back to talk about it.<br><br>Now that we have more and more ways to restart people&#39;s heart, and now that we&#39;re closer to the &quot;End Times&quot;, we&#39;re being allowed to hear of more and more of these experiences.<br><br>There&#39;s NDE&#39;s from blind people, blind their whole life, and they die for a moment on the operating table.  They come back and talk about what they look like, what the doctor looks like, all the nurses, details about how the room looks, etc.  Obviously when they&#39;re back in their body, they&#39;re blind again, but think of if it&#39;s just &quot;brains and chemicals, or lack of oxygen&quot;......how can a brain make a totally blind person see?  This is PROOF that we have souls that leave the body.<br><br>We are spirits wearing a meatsuit, like drivers inside a car.  You are not your body, you are the driver.  You volunteered to be here and have this life, and the study of NDE&#39;s helps us know where we came from and where we&#39;re going to.<br><br>I&#39;m reading some of these comments, and I&#39;m seeing a mountain of ignorance and desperation to explain these NDE&#39;s away as something false.  If you try to debunk NDE&#39;s, but you put no time into actually STUDYING the evidence for or against them, then you&#39;re an ignorant person who formulates opinions at the hip without ANY research into the subject.  You don&#39;t believe they&#39;re true because that makes atheists feel uncomfortable.  Atheists don&#39;t want any moral accountability so they dismiss NDE&#39;s away any way they can.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but if you bothered to STUDY the subject, you&#39;d find the irrefutable evidence that they&#39;re real.<br><br>There&#39;s lots of NDE&#39;s where blind/deaf people (from birth) are able to see and hear amazingly during their NDE.  They come back to their body blind/deaf again, but explain how &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; can make a blind/deaf person see/hear perfectly?<br><br>There&#39;s &quot;shared NDE&#39;s&quot; where family members share visions of a relative who&#39;s passing right there.  How can &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; do that?<br><br>There&#39;s been cases of people on operating tables, getting brain surgery, blood totally drained from their head, ZERO brain activity (machines are actually monitoring the brain activity) but there was nothing.  Yet they come back sharing details of what the doctors said/did.  How&#39;s that possible for &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; to do that with no blood in the brain?<br><br>There&#39;s other cases, where people describe things impossible to know if it&#39;s just &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; like seeing what clothes a relative is wearing as they&#39;re rushing to the hospital to talk to the patient before they pass.  They saw what clothes the relatives were wearing and what the conversation was in the car.<br><br>Many many people have seen details happening in the room/scene that can be corroborated with first responders or others that are there.  Thus proving they aren&#39;t making it up, and proving they saw/heard something while their body is dead and not in a position to see or hear this detail.<br><br>You can talk to any ICU or Hospice nurse and they will tell you crazy unbelievable stories they&#39;ve witnessed.  I&#39;m sorry if details from NDE&#39;s scare you or don&#39;t align with what you want your world to be like.  I&#39;m sorry if you want to continue to be selfish, continue to look at porn, and just continue to sin in general.  This stuff is real, and the evidence is there.  If you actually STUDY NDE&#39;s without being foolish and dismissing them without studying them, then it&#39;s your problem when you eventually die and you discover they were all correct.<br><br>You better correct your selfish life and turn from sin while you still can.  You AREN&#39;T going to like where you end up.  <br><br>God doesn&#39;t send people to Hell, they send themselves there.  God provides a way OUT of it."

"6107","After Death",2023-10-03,"I had a NDE.. The crickets melted into one sound, which sounded like the flatline on a vital monitor in an ambulance.. The industrial AC sounded like my frames per second dropping down to 0. I saw the end of humanity, everyone who ever existed or will, is here in this tunnel, formed out of their bodies in this black just, nothingness. They formed a tube of the rest of humanity and they aren&#39;t wearing any skin - the outside is just humans with their backs turned toward me - muscles exposed. One of them turned around  and is now facing me, still just muscle..  He told me that the only way we humans made it to the end of everything, is because &quot;we rose together, or else, we would&#39;ve fallen apart.&quot; However there was nothing left to do at this point. The Universe .. Everything...  Was ending , it was the end of all of it. They allowed me to enter the entirety of this tunnel of humanity and become part of them. Now, as I&#39;m looking inward to this tube, I look left and I look right, and it just goes on for infinity... We were all connected, holding each other together so tightly, that not even the void of space could penetrate us. But it&#39;s still the end; So as I&#39;m digesting what&#39;s happening, the human next to me looks at me and says, &quot;If this is the last breath of humanity, we breathe it together.&quot; By this point, I had accepted what&#39;s going on by now... and so, I take one big final deep breath along with every other human; and we all exhale as everything fades to dark.<br><br>Suddenly, there was nothing. It wasn&#39;t long, it wasn&#39;t forever, it wasn&#39;t infinite. It was just.. blank. It was Nothingness. Like trying to remember what it was like before you were born. <br>Then after possibly eons of &quot;nothing&quot;, a void, a total absence of everything including time itself, I remember taking and hearing my first breath. It was almost unfamiliar, I remember thinking ever so slightly, &quot;was that a breath?&quot; and then it happened, again, I felt second one... And then I remembered I used to be alive... But I died.. And I thought to myself  &quot;No way.. it&#39;s impossible that I&#39;m breathing.&quot; I thought, let me try and see if I can do it a third time... If I can take a third breath, I&#39;m not dead. I took my third breath and every other one since, even as I type this. My first thoughts were that we could be anything, we could be farmers, race car drivers, parents, mechanics, or CEOs.  We can do stuff... We&#39;re not dead yet, this is not the end. Humans have what it takes to make it to the end of everything, so we need to rewire how we see ourselves. Anything is possible as long as we draw a breath. As long as we breathe, we can attempt to achieve anything, because it&#39;s not over yet."

Fairly shallow, reads as more of a hate letter to the middle classes than a scathing ‚Äòeat the rich‚Äô thriller (but what can you expect when the writer/director comes from money herself lol). Super funny though, they should be marketing it as a dark comedy, and a total visual feast as seen in this trailer. Really great performances from the main cast."
"6161","Past Lives",2023-02-23,"&quot;Even simply brushing clothes with someone is fate&quot; (Ïò∑ÍπÉÎßå Ïä§Ï≥êÎèÑ Ïù∏Ïó∞) is an old Korean proverb that means every interaction between you and another person‚Äîeven a stranger on the street‚Äîis never an accident, but rather the elaborate result of your past lives and theirs intertwining to make that momentary interaction happen. And if even the most seemingly trivial of interactions are the result of elaborate workings of fate (Ïù∏Ïó∞), then something as significant as meeting the love of your life is the result of 8000 Í≤Å of fate. This is a commonly known Buddhist teaching. Í≤Å (Gup) is a measurement of time. Imagine a massive boulder, and imagine that a single raindrop falls on that boulder once every 1000 years. The amount of time it would take for the boulder to finally crack from the water droplets is 1 Í≤Å. A single Í≤Å is an unfathomably long period of time, so 8000 Í≤Å is something that&#39;s hard to even attempt to imagine. The saying goes that for every married couple, there&#39;s at least 8000 Í≤Å of Ïù∏Ïó∞ (fate) from their past lives that led them to each other."

"6164","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Hey, I&#39;m from South Korea and I can relate to this trailer... Almost same thing happened to me recently. Around 17 years ago, when I was in elementary, I met a boy whose name was &quot;Present&quot; in Korean. He was my first crush. I liked his shiny round eyes, a cute wide smile, and white teeth. Sadly, I had to move to another  school a year later. 18 years passed, and we met each other this January. We have become both 25. He studies in medical school and I just came back to S.Korea after obtaining a diploma from another country. I didn&#39;t know he had been reading all my posts on my public diary for a few months when I was back in France. Though he knew the one who was writing the diary was me, he never said &quot;Hi&quot; to me. Then one day I deleted a link that had access to my public diary, so he missed a chance to let me know. <br>A few years passed, and he noticed one comment in the comment section of one youtube video which showed a whole view of our hometown where we used to play together. That comment was, surprisingly, written by me. He noticed that it was me because I wrote down some of my personal background in the comment. He already knew I was living in France and I had a very special surname that stood out. <br>So we met each other once again through Youtube and we talked hours and hours on social media. We finally met each other this January and we had a nice Italian lunch, drank coffee and talked for hours and hours... I think we had a nice time. <br>We are not together tho. Maybe it was because of a bad timing or maybe because I&#39;ve been having some issues with my mentality and physical health or maybe because he was in senior year at medical school...or maybe because I seemed such a deep person to him. BUT the important thing is, I have a feeling that we are still connected and one day we will see each other once again at right time and a right place.<br>Magic happens to those who believe in magic :)<br>Anyways, thank you for reading my magical storyüíõ"
"6165","Past Lives",2023-02-25,"Oh I love how the movie basically describes how you can still hold that love, reminiscing all the good memories, but you both know that you don&#39;t need to be together at the end anyway. Because those beautiful memories and feelings are only enough to keep you satisfied and happy with what you two have now."
"6166","Past Lives",2023-02-23,"Well, someone just NAILED the casting for this one. 2 minutes, 24 seconds and the chemistry is rock solid. No need for over the top dialogue when you have such amazing body language. Soundtrack puts the nail in &#39;emotional&#39; coffin.     Can&#39;t wait"
"6167","Past Lives",2023-03-03,"Reconnected with my love after almost 10 years apart this past fall in NYC (I‚Äôm thirty). Coincidentally, the first time we saw each other we also ended up in Brooklyn and took pictures in the same places they are taking pictures in the movie with the bridge in the background. <br><br>Circumstances took her across the world. I always knew she was the one and on starry nights, red sunsets, during milestones and in silent moments of reflection, I would wonder if I was still in her heart as she was in mine. <br><br>When we finally met up, I remember gazing into her eyes for hours searching for answers, we said so much to each other without saying a single word. Turns out, I have been in her heart as much as she‚Äôs been in mine. <br><br>3 months later this past January I travelled to meet her family. We‚Äôre hoping to get engaged mid year and planning a wedding for early 2024. Timing is everything and in our hearts and in our core, we always hoped to be each others forevers.<br><br>Update: We got married in Feb 2024"

"6170","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Romance movies are not generally something I seek out, but it looks like the themes in this go deeper than the standard romance film. I am excited to see this!"

"6174","Past Lives",2023-05-23,"Wow.  Anyone who has experienced a strong, deep mutual romantic connection with someone, but who knew that it could never be for whatever reason, will instantly connect with this trailer, and I presume the film."

This movie will definitely leave a beautiful scar."
"6176","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"i felt butterflies just by watching this trailer... this is so relatable for both sides, i mean... we all can see ourselves in his situation, bur also at hers, who wouldn&#39;t want to see again some childhood love?<br>crazy, cant wait to see it."
"6177","Past Lives",2023-02-28,"Among all the superhero movies around us, A24 never seems to fail to deliver real stories."
"6178","Past Lives",2023-03-26,"Every husband&#39;s worst fear is finding out you were just....easy to live with and her heart was elsewhere. Her smiles that never touched her eyes, the lack of conversation on date night, or missing quiet shared moments. The feeling of being alone when she&#39;s right next to you...let it go. Let her go. She&#39;s too afraid to say it herself. She doesn&#39;t have to heart...but maybe you don&#39;t either."
"6179","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Can&#39;t wait to watch it. I&#39;ve heard that it was the best movie viewed at Sundance. The concept is gripping. Chills would go through my spine at the thought of meeting my crush 20 years later. So beautiful characters."

"6181","Past Lives",2023-05-12,"Saw this last night as the opening film for the Seattle International Film Festival and was just utterly blown away. Such an absolutely beautiful film‚ÄîI&#39;m so impressed by how Celine Song is completely unafraid to allow a moment to just...breathe. And how her characters convey so much with just a look or a gesture, negating the need for dialogue. <br><br>Adding to the overall feel of the film was the score, which had an ethereal quality that made it feel as if you were watching the story unfold as if in a dream. Just stunning. If you have a chance to go see this film, I highly recommend it!"
"6182","Past Lives",2023-02-25,"I just got teary watching the trailer. Maybe because I left Korea 40 years ago. I was just a kid then.

"6184","Past Lives",2023-02-26,"Ïù∏Ïó∞ is one of my favorite words in Korean, and I loved hearing it often when I was in Korea. It speaks to the depth of how Koreans think of relationships and the word comes from Buddhist teachings. It is nice to see a film that will speak on that. I am also looking forward to the Korean-American mix of thinking in this film. I just hope she does not leave her husband. I just hope they meet each other as friends and it is a good memory but I hope she is faithful. I am looking forward to seeing this film."
"6185","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Another perfect film from A24 is never a bad thing!"
"6186","Past Lives",2023-02-23,"From Love to Hate You - to this movie that really looks promising, I love that Teo Yoo is gaining mainstream traction! And he&#39;s not doing it by playing cliche movies/dramas, but he&#39;s taking on projects that are so unique and beautiful! Tbh I only got to know him from his very female empowering drama, Love to Hate You  but seeing this trailer, I think I&#39;m gonna keep an eye out for him from now on. I&#39;m a new fan! &lt;3"

"6194","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Reminds me of the sequence in Yi Yi when the father meets up with a childhood friend and they seamlessly go through these ups and downs in what could have been. This looks beautiful!"

"6199","Past Lives",2023-02-28,"I grew up in Japan and I had a childhood friend just like this movie! Our parents used to joke that we&#39;ll be a married couple when we grow up. Then we moved to California where I&#39;d spend a majority of my adult life. Sometimes when I look at my old photo albums and see our pictures together, I do wonder how he&#39;s doing or whether or not he still remembers me"
"6200","Past Lives",2023-04-08,"This is such a beautifully edited trailer. What a tender, compelling, sweet story. It feels so good to see something so tender and to have it move me too my core. The abrasiveness of life has been suffocating lately. The music, the storyline, and the vulnerability of the characters has me soaked in tears and so relieved to not be bombarded by crass vulgarity and violence. I want to find the fucking pause button on life and keep it solely on these tender, quiet, lovely, joyful, awe inspiring moments. I also appreciate when films pay such beautiful homage to cultural philosophies/wisdom such as this one regarding past lives and its poetic interpretation of our daily life."
"6201","Past Lives",2023-02-23,"I don‚Äôt usually watch romance movies but dude- this looks absolutely stellar. I love A24 and their horror but this just seems like a beautifully haunting film. I‚Äôll be anticipating this one"

"6210","Past Lives",2023-03-10,"I was repressing so much emotion  today and watching this has opened the floodgates at last... so beautiful in a way that breaks your heart endlessly and restores your faith endlessly. <br><br>If anyone could recommend any films on a similar wavelength, I&#39;d love to hear it!"
"6211","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Saw this at Sundance, truly an incredible film. Exceptionally shot for Celine Song‚Äôs debut feature-length film. Recommending this to everyone."
"6212","Past Lives",2023-02-22,"Just saw this at the Berlin Film Festival and it was amazing! It really should win the competition, nothing else I saw came close. Such a beautiful adult drama. The husband character was my favourite, he dealt with the situation in such an empathetic way."

"6217","Suzume",2022-12-06,"First a meteor that obliterated a village, then a disastrous weather that flooded half of Japan. I pray for these characters&#39; survival after the next calamity hits their hometown or Japan as usual."
"6218","Suzume",2022-12-12,"I feel like people don&#39;t quite realize that these films are magical because Shinkai and Radwimps are doing them together like how Miyazaki and Hisaishi did in their generation"
"6219","Suzume",2022-12-06,"This song already feels nostalgic. Imagine how nostalgic this would be after a couple of years."
"6220","Suzume",2023-04-09,"Just saw this yesterday. While I think Your Name is still Makoto Shinkai&#39;s best writing, I believe Suzume is his best work as a director to date. The colors and shot composition in Suzume are amazing. The whole thing is wonderfully cinematic. Another aspect in which Suzume surpasses his other films is the humor. There&#39;s so much genuine humor to soak up. I was worried the whole &quot;living chair&quot; thing would come across as too LOL RANDOM, but it&#39;s done masterfully."
"6221","Suzume",2022-12-06,"Shinkai‚Äôs works are always gorgeously animated and a hell of an emotional ride. Have to see this in theaters!"
"6222","Suzume",2022-12-10,"I saw this in Japan last month. Highly recommend seeing it, I don&#39;t think the story is as good as Your Name, but it&#39;s still decent and the visuals are AMAZING as usual. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s taking 6 months to release in the US."
"6223","Suzume",2022-12-06,"The super smooth animation, the ambient music and visuals, etc. Pretty much everything about this trailer looks amazing. I&#39;m <b>definitely</b> going to see this movie once it comes out. It will be my introduction into Makoto Shinkai&#39;s works."
"6224","Suzume",2022-12-12,"The shot where it shows a Land surrounded by a sky full of stars, reminds me of the scene from the movie Children who Chase the lost voices, previous works of Makoto Shinkai, which also showcases a world hidden beyond a door.....it&#39;s so beautiful how he visualises his ideas into a story."
"6225","Suzume",2022-12-06,"After watching Garden of Words and Your Name, I fell in love with this director‚Äôs works and have been on top of his movies ever since. I seriously can‚Äôt wait until this comes out in theaters! Thank you for all the beautiful things you create Makoto Shinkai, I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT!!!"
"6226","Suzume",2022-12-10,"Beautiful song. It creates a whole mood for the trailer, somewhat whimsical yet somber. Which makes it beautiful, but also seems like it would be heartbreaking. If the film creates the same mood I feel like it&#39;s gonna be a rollercoaster ride. On my calendar!"
"6227","Suzume",2022-12-13,"who knew that ProZD&#39;s Chairem anime would finally get the adaptation it deserves"

"6229","Suzume",2022-12-10,"Makoto Shinkai is becoming my favorite director. Every movie is just a masterpiece and the music by Radwimps takes the movie to another lvl. I hope he connects this movie to Kimi no na wa universe like he did with Tenki no ko."
"6230","Suzume",2022-12-06,"I‚Äôm so happy there‚Äôs a release date now! When I saw the Quints in the theaters, this played before it. I‚Äôve loved the song since it released, it‚Äôs so beautiful. Can‚Äôt wait for the movie."
"6231","Suzume",2022-12-10,"the movie looks hella beautiful and now im even more excited to watch it in April when it comes out... whether that&#39;s alone or with a friend"
"6232","Suzume",2022-12-13,"I&#39;m blown away by this animation. Same thing happened to me with Kimi no Nawa and Tenki no Ko. Seems like the post-apocalypse theme will further draw audiences in to watch it. Somehow this is totally different. With the last two films which are a bit more light/airy, this looks more withered down. Makoto Shinkai never fails to impress. More of his future projects could possibly enamor us to delve in deeper into this kind of universe."
"6233","Suzume",2022-12-06,"Makoto Shinkai has consistently released fire since Garden of Words"
"6234","Suzume",2022-12-11,"Saw this movie in Japan last week‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall are in for a treat. I‚Äôm still shook to my core"
"6235","Suzume",2022-12-06,"Makoto Shinkai never disappoints."
"6236","Suzume",2022-12-07,"Shinkai has become one of my new favorite directors. I can&#39;t wait to see this. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s supposed to end the loop set up with Your Name and Weathering With You, and I&#39;m very intrigued to see how."
"6237","Suzume",2022-12-06,"The song-- always gives me chills"
"6238","Suzume",2023-01-21,"Can we talk about how hard the song slaps? Especially when this trailer plays in theaters. Majestic."
"6239","Suzume",2022-12-07,"This animation looks PHENOMENAL!!!!!! I am so excited to see this in theaters!"
"6240","Suzume",2022-12-12,"After watching Your Name i fell in love with this directors work ! Your name is and will be for ever my favorite anime movie. Weathering with you will also be always in my hearth and i think suzume will be in it too... im glad to be born in this time of the earth and can enjoy such amazing films !"
"6241","Suzume",2022-12-06,"The first Makoto Shinkai I‚Äôm watching in theatres can‚Äôt wait"
"6242","Suzume",2022-12-30,"This soundtrack is so fire, I played this song on repeat for over 3hrs. Honestly I haven&#39;t ever even heard of this series but I might just watch it because of the sound track and because the animation is fire."
"6243","Suzume",2022-12-16,"I first learned about the origin of the strange name Suzume (sparrow) in an interview with NHK director Shinkai.  When Shinkai visited the disaster area four months after the Great East Japan Earthquake, he saw numerous sparrows chirping.  Sparrows, which normally live in human settlements, were found in many depopulated disaster areas."
"6244","Suzume",2022-12-11,"most ost made you feel and love the song so much because you already know and had seen the show/story the song was all abt and thus you relive the scenes that perfectly depicts a certain verse or music drop. but this is one of those songs that really REALLY makes you feel as if you&#39;re transported into a world/place that you created yourself without knowing much abt the movie it&#39;s supposed to be for. it&#39;s a song that will not fail to take you into that somewhere you don&#39;t even know, but felt like you lived once. <br>yeah, RADWIMPS did it again."
"6245","Suzume",2022-12-06,"So nostalgic, I also fell for a longhaired pretty stranger like him. What a wonderful anime :&#39;)"
"6246","Suzume",2023-04-02,"Any trailer for an animated movie that makes me shiver is gonna get a watch. This looks absolutely beautiful. The thing that hits me the hardest about Makoto Shinkai&#39;s movies are the LIFE lessons. They resonate to the core for those that pay attention. Not all the movies have amazing ratings like &quot;Your Name&quot; but in my opinion each of them are masterpieces in their own way."
"6247","Suzume",2022-12-06,"Finalmente temos a data confirmada, Makoto Shinkai consegue &quot;zerar a vida&quot; toda vez que lan√ßa um filme novo, o que nos deixa empolgados e curiosos para enfim descobrir se esse universo se conecta com &quot;Your Name &amp; Tenki no Ko&quot; (A criatividade dele √© sem limites, um sonho ver o universo de Makoto Shinkai conectado) üáßüá∑"
"6248","Suzume",2022-12-11,"I&#39;m glad I&#39;m currently in Japan, it really makes me appreciate how early things drop here compared to other countries. It&#39;s already been out for like a month"
"6249","Suzume",2022-12-10,"I&#39;ve been waiting for this to release in the U.S! I am so excited to finally see it!!! Your Name and Weathering With You are both masterpieces, and I am certain that Suzume is going to be another one. Makato Shinkai&#39;s films are beautiful and never disappoint."
"6250","Suzume",2022-12-13,"I am addicted to the movies of Makoto shinkai.   I wish he had released one movie every year. Your name and weathering with you are top notch. Is there any anime movies like these two?"
"6251","Suzume",2022-12-06,"still get chills watching each and every trailer! Man I‚Äôm so excited to watch this when it is released in the US! This movie will definitely open new doors of oppurtunities because this is looking magical!"
"6252","Suzume",2022-12-17,"back in 2007-2009, when I first saw Makoto Shinkai work Byosoku 5cm, I know he&#39;s just brilliant animovie maker. and since then, always waiting for his work."
"6253","Suzume",2022-12-10,"literally 4 second into the video and i already decided to watch this movie. the music is soooo  great and I fell in love with it immediately , so enchanted"

"6257","Suzume",2022-12-12,"I didn&#39;t know this was a trailer for a movie or a trailer for a Shinkai movie at the start but I sure knew what it was before his name came up on screen by the end. I don&#39;t think anything else puts in quite so much effort to how the light looks, to be honest."
"6258","Suzume",2022-12-11,"This style reminds me so much of Your Name. Can&#39;t wait to see where this is going."
"6259","Suzume",2022-12-13,"I recognized the beautiful art style immediately as from garden of words and was happy to see its the same director."
"6260","Suzume",2022-12-12,"Goosebumps in the first 5 seconds. Can&#39;t wait!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>Beautiful visuals and voice."

"6263","Suzume",2022-12-19,"Gonna have to see this one in theater since I couldn&#39;t see Your Name or Weathering with You. Can&#39;t wait for April!"
"6264","Suzume",2022-12-26,"I gotta be honest.. I really wanted to see Makoto Shinkai try some new directions, if not with the story at least with the art direction. Don&#39;t get me wrong, these visuals looks absolutely incredible, however this style has already been perfected (BY THEMSELVES!)<br><br>I mean, imagine these guys doing a dystopian futuristic type thing.. now that would be something üòâ<br>The music was amazing though &lt;3"

"6274","Suzume",2022-12-10,"I was literally getting prepared to go to the cinema to watch it nov. 11, I‚Äôm like this is going to be anime film of the year. Then only when I was ready to buy the tickets realized it was nov for Japan only. I was almost about to cry. I remember I was hungry and tired from work that day too. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a solid film."
"6275","Suzume",2022-12-15,"I watched this in Japan. It was much better than &quot;Your Name&quot; and &quot;Weathering with you&quot;. Never miss the masterpiece.<br><br>Before watching this, you should know that the story is based on the earthquake disaster that actually happened in Japan on March 11, 2011. Otherwise, it may be difficult to understand the details of the movie."

"6301","Ferrari",2023-10-23,"This could be a really good way to make a connected movie series with all the biggest manufacturers in racing history. Ford vs Ferrari, now this then could do companies like Porsche, Audi and Mercedes. Then join them all together for a Le Mans race with all the teams"

But, you never knew when it was coming. That was one secret to how amazing she was. Example, she could go high, or like in the anthem she aims for a lower alternate take on the &quot;braaaa-aaave&quot; at the end. She knew how to make it stun."

The fact that the trailer showed no drugs , let‚Äôs me know they focused on the right thing. HER VOICE, and it‚Äôs about damn time. Yes drugs will be shown because it was apart of her struggles but I‚Äôm glad that the main focus seems to be her voice, the tribute Whitney deserves. She was more then her demons!!! üëèüèæ<br><br>Update: To the responses of her not looking like Whitney , y‚Äôall can be mad all y‚Äôall want , Naomi won the role fair and square, she auditioned just like everybody else!! The role was not handed to her, she put in the work , and gave Whitney‚Äôs team what they were looking for, im almost 100% sure there was several girls that looked more like her during the audition process that took nearly a year but if Naomi gave the best performance then she was the right choice!!!!! She is an actress not a look alike impersonator. Y‚Äôall see a trailer and assume she isn‚Äôt the right choice y‚Äôall do this with damn near every biopic that comes out , and majority of the time the actors y‚Äôall bully for not looking like the person their playing honestly ends up being some of best performances! Recently Austin Butler as Elvis literally Austin didn‚Äôt look shit like Elvis but he nailed that part because his job was to act!!! So is Naomi‚Äôs!!!"

"6851","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman IS a action movie star, glad to see him in this type a role again. dude needs more of these. he just looks like a badass"
"6852","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"I&#39;m so happy to see Joel Kinnaman finally getting the recognition he deserves. What an underrated actor that is extraordinary in every role he commits to. A revenge filled action hero is the style that suits him and I&#39;m so glad to see him finally cementing his footing on the big screen with more movies! I&#39;ve been such a huge fan of his career since the Killing and RoboCop and it makes me so happy to see him in a film like this. I can&#39;t wait."
"6853","Silent Night",2023-10-08,"An action movie with no dialogue. As a HoH (hard of hearing) action fan, this is music to my eyes! No lip reading, no staring at subtitles. Just pure balls to the wall action. No thinking required!"
"6854","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman is amazing and I&#39;ve been a huge fan ever since Altered Carbon. I will watch anything this guy does, I think he&#39;s great. This looks like loads of fun and I can&#39;t wait for it to release."
"6855","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman is an amazing actor, criminally underutilized. And to see Kid Cudi involved in this brings me much joy. I have high hopes for this movie!"

"6863","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"Speechless Joel Kinnaman with John Wick moves, especially the last gunshots is what interested me more than some cheesy Christmas action violent night. Its great to see Joel Kinnaman in action again! 4.10.2023"

"6866","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"I don&#39;t know why, but this movie has me not only feeling giddy for a new John Woo film, but also feeling oddly glad. Our area had a number of gang-related freeway shootings that ending up leaving innocent children injured and/or dead. I feel that this movie is not only a great, kick-ass movie by John Woo, it&#39;s also a cathartic revenge fantasy for those who feel some lasting trauma from those real-life events. RIP Jasper Wu and Eliyanah. Wish the people who killed these poor babies could suffer this same fate."
"6867","Silent Night",2023-10-10,"SO EXCITED FOR JOHN WOO&#39;S RETURN. The best action director of our lifetime. You can always count on John Woo."

"6870","Silent Night",2023-11-27,"I&#39;m all for Joel Kinnaman. Whether this is a hit or miss, he&#39;s bred for this."
"6871","Silent Night",2023-10-05,"I can really appreciate that the trailer seems to suggest that great deal of training and planning were required before old buddy could get his revenge. It‚Äôs refreshing compared to the trope that being angry is enough for a regular person to get revenge on criminal organizations."
"6872","Silent Night",2023-10-06,"For those interested in Kinnaman:<br>Before Joel Kinnaman became a Hollywood star he starred in a Swedish Cop/Gangster movie series called Johan Falk (GSI), as the incredibly charming and likable Frank Wagner. The movies are in Swedish, but you can probably find them with English subtitles. They are really good, and Joel Kinnaman really carries the series."
"6873","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"2023 so far has been an action film lovers wet dream, we‚Äôve had John Wick 4, Sisu, Extraction 2, Equalizer 3, and now John Woo‚Äôs return with Silent Night. It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cryü•π"

"6880","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"I&#39;m definitely going to see this!!!<br>Joel Kinnaman is one of my favorite and highly underrated action stars.....I loved him in Robocop and Altered Carbon.<br>This looks like action start to finish."
"6881","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Absolutely loved Joel as the lead in the RoboCop reboot. Hopefully this next shot as a lead goes well for him."

"6885","Silent Night",2023-11-17,"Nothing like a John Woo movie to get in the Christmas spirit üòä. In all honesty I‚Äôm always happy to see the legendary director‚Äôs movies."
"6886","Silent Night",2023-10-06,"I don&#39;t know if the movie will be good or not, but I am glad John woo still doing movies...He still has cool ideas for action sequences!"

"6888","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"John Woo, a great comeback. He&#39;s the one who started all the stylish slow motion actions scenes and bullet times. Where was he all this time?"
"6889","Silent Night",2023-10-11,"I know people who would STAND UP AND APPLAUD in the theater seeing this trailer. &quot;JOHN WOO&#39;S BACK??!! NO WAY!!&quot; It sure looks interesting. I hope it&#39;s one of the greatest movies ever made."
"6890","Silent Night",2023-10-04,"Wow, this movie looks so awesome. It‚Äôs like a cross between John Wick meets diehard. I can‚Äôt wait to see it. Looks like a bloody good time.

"6892","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Wow this looks incredible, Face/Off is one of my favorite action movies ever. Can&#39;t wait to watch this one. Let&#39;s see the Doves Fly."
"6893","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"John woo created Gun Fu and the John Wick movies are inspired by John Woo. This movie could be the best and the smartest action movie of the 21st century."
"6894","Silent Night",2023-10-03,"Nothing speaks &quot;peace on earth and good will toward men&quot; like an action flick during the most wonderful time of the year."

"6919","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-12,"A24 = original stories. Not remakes, sequels or recycled stories. They are bold. Even on their worst day I much rather watch one of their authentic new stories fail than to rehear/watch an altered recycled original. They are a fresh breath of air to cinema."
"6920","Beau Is Afraid",2023-02-22,"I absolutely love when a movie trailer grabs my attention but doesn&#39;t tell me a single thing about the plot of the movie. 10/10"
"6921","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Ari Aster and Joaquin Phoenix sounded like a match made in heaven when Beau Is Afraid was first announced, now this looks like it will be one of the most bizarre, introspective, and comedically terrifying films in recent years and I couldn&#39;t be happier to welcome it with open arms."
"6922","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You‚Äôre not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire movie, but it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe. Such a good trailer!"
"6923","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-12,"I love how these trailers barely tell anything about what happens, so nothing is spoiled, but also show everything at once about the movie"
"6924","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Finally an Aster movie where his twisted sense of humor is a top priority. Love it"
"6925","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"You know a movie will be good when the preview does not spoil and leaves you wanting to discover what Beau is afraid of. Bravo"
"6926","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"A24 is easily in the top 3 production companies right now. Even their work that isn&#39;t as popularly recognized is all of a really high standard and most have their own cult followings. I always get a feeling like I&#39;m in a fever dream watching A24 movies and it&#39;s rare that production companies can achieve that effect where you are enveloped in the story time after time üôè"
"6927","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"There is NOTHING I enjoy more on this planet than creative and weird movies. This is beautiful."
"6928","Beau Is Afraid",2023-03-17,"I love when a good director gets popular enough that they&#39;re allowed to be weird."
"6929","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Thanks Ari Aster for keeping the art of cinema alive and thanks Joaquin Phoenix for sculpting these characters with your unique talent. All the waiting has been worth it, this movie looks mind blowing."
"6930","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"God bless Ari Aster!"
"6931","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Joaquin Phoenix is one of those rare actors who whenever I see that he&#39;s involved in a project I have to watch it. Such a tremendously gifted actor."
"6932","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This is what I want to see above all else when it comes to movies. Something from a filmmaker who has a vision and wants to slap me across the face with it. Repeatedly."
"6933","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This could be a new example of ‚Äúpsychological horror ‚Äú we need  more filmmakers like Ari , we need people that push the limits of a preexisting art to something new ‚ù§"
"6934","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-19,"I had the pleasure of working with Joaquin as an actor in Hollywood before he was famous, and he hasn&#39; t changed a bit. He&#39;s still the same shy, modest kid he always was. And hugely talented. A million best wishes, Joaquin.."
"6935","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m gonna find this movie to be more terrifying, or hysterical... and that has me so excited. Ari sure is talented filmmaker. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s switching up his style. Almost feels like this film was made for Joaquin, it&#39;s his style of weird/funny/tragic."
"6936","Beau Is Afraid",2023-04-13,"It really warms my heart to see A24 carve out their little niche and find so much success. This is what I loved about movies. It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. I want to watch big, dumb superhero popcorn flicks AND be blown away by stuff like this."
"6937","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Really grateful for all movies released by A24 and the support they give to innovative, talented directors with original ideas. It is refreshing to see that in the industry."
"6938","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Love that Ari is really leaning into the comedy aspect of his style, this feels really unique. Can&#39;t wait to see what they&#39;ve been working on."
"6939","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-13,"I love A24 movies. They&#39;re pure artistic expression. Thank The All for the boldness of Ari Aster. The All delivers and Ari goes to work. He don&#39;t give a crap what anybody thinks about his stories."
"6940","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"This feels like what my grandmother went through in the last few years of her life. All she wanted was to get home (even though she was home). Dementia‚Äôs not pretty üòî"

"6942","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-15,"I have a weird feeling this is going to be a combination of The Truman Show &amp; Misery on steroids. Ari Aster‚Äôs first two were nothing short of masterpieces. This will eclipse both. I‚Äôm so excited for this movie and I‚Äôve been waiting for this trailer for almost two years now. LFG Beau!"
"6943","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I love how Ari Aster‚Äôs third film feels so completely different than his first two films. This looks like such a fresh horror movie. Also, I don‚Äôt know if that is just a kid or really Joaquin Phoenix as the kid but they look SO SIMILAR HOLY CRAP!"
"6944","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This was actually a really good trailer, showed a lot of the chaos that‚Äôs about to unfold without actually revealing too much."
"6945","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-12,"This looks like a positively gorgeous"
"6946","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I love the detail that the trailer begins in a dark way.  Almost like Ari Aster telling you &quot;See? I&#39;m the director of Hereditary&quot; But then things turn into some kind of crazy adventure through the mind of a protagonist with certain mental problems."
"6947","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Even an Aster trailer has more love, art and awesomeness packed into it than 97% of what comes out of Hollywood these days."
"6948","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"The biggest thing about Joaquin&#39;s movies is that viscerally you feel that each character he plays is simply a true expression or extension of himself. It&#39;s a bit sad to me but I thank him in the long run for his thespian talent and the sacrifices he has made for all of us."
"6949","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-13,"The folklore that always gives birth to Ari&#39;s ideas are just as fascinating as his story telling and cinematic immersion.<br>Add A24 to the mix and this will be epic"
"6950","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I love how Ari has kind of created his own sub genre. I‚Äôve been dying for his next film since Midsommar. Can‚Äôt waitttttt"
"6951","Beau Is Afraid",2023-02-20,"As chaotic as this trailer is, it fills me with peace. I can‚Äôt explain why. The ending of the trailer always gives me goosebumps"
"6952","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"A24 doesn‚Äôt mess around! They continue to produce the most unique, ingenious, mind-bending films! Keep ‚Äòem coming! üòä"

"6956","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Ari Aster, supertramp and magnificent cast. A24 getting ready to drop another bomb. They just never disappoint."
"6957","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This looks like Ari Aster is doing a Charlie Kaufman script and I AM HERE FOR IT."
"6958","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This looks insane! Not what I was expecting at all. Definitely seeing this in theaters"
"6959","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-22,"Hereditary and Midsommar are my favorite horror/thriller type movies, I‚Äôm so stoked for this movie. Ari Aster is awesome, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what he delivers with this film!"
"6960","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-12,"The way Joaquin reflects every color of the human psyche is just a beautiful thing to see. He&#39;s iridescent."
"6961","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"That moment when you are more excited for a trailer than you&#39;ve been all year for anything else."
"6962","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-12,"I was in highschool when A24 started making movies and I felt like such a cool film nerd because I could recommend all the new movies to my friends and we were all equally blown away. I stopped keeping up with them a while ago just because I got away from movies, but this makes me as excited to see this as their earlier stuff did! Looks absolutely fantastic, love the style, what it might be about, and I love Joaquin Phoenix so I‚Äôll definitely see this one!"
"6963","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"After the success of ‚ÄúEverything, Everywhere, All At Once‚Äù, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see ‚ÄúBeau Is Afraid‚Äù reach that summit, especially with Joaquin Phoenix starring in a wacky, self-imploding, &amp; an artistic motion picture masterpiece with Ari Aster to direct!"

"6966","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Ari is one of the best filmmakers to come up over the past 10 years, so hyped for another amazing movie from himüëç"
"6967","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-13,"They have over 50 movies (made by them), a company that started out in 2012 by distributing independent movies, now they‚Äôve brought us masterpieces like ‚ÄúMidsommar‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Lighthouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúMen‚Äù, ‚ÄúHereditary‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt Comes At Night‚Äù, ‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù and  ‚ÄúEverything Everywhere All At Once‚Äù, i love A24, i hope they‚Äôll get the recognition that they truly deserve."
"6968","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-11,"I love when a trailer leaves me confused and intrigued at the same time. Can‚Äôt wait to watch!"
"6969","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Was not expecting Aster&#39;s new film to be somewhat of a comedy, but I am all in for it!"
"6970","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I feel it&#39;s definitely a film filled with thought provoking metaphors. Very excited to see this."
"6971","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Love how this looks very different in tone from Midsommar and Hereditary yet you still feel uneasy in typical Aster fashion. So stocked for this !"
"6972","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"This is the most insane movie trailer I‚Äôve ever seen, I couldn‚Äôt keep up with it for a second and I have no clue what the movie will even be about. I love it."

"6976","Beau Is Afraid",2023-03-16,"A24 - bringing movies back to the theater that have more than superheros from comic books in them.  It feels like the 1970s again.  Good job."
"6977","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"The colour palette, cinematography and editing made this trailer feel like a dream"
"6978","Beau Is Afraid",2023-04-05,"Not exactly sure what this is about, but the trailer here filled me with a sense of existential dread and terror. While it&#39;s clearly visually bright and happy in a lot of ways, it&#39;s suffocatingly creepy, in an effective way. I got the impression that this is a film about anxiety, and the ever-present threat of terrible things happening if you ever dare take any risk or step outside."
"6979","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I can&#39;t even put into words how excited I am for this masterpiece to be released."
"6980","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-17,"Ive been waiting for this since he talked about the movie years ago, so excited we finally have a trailer and can seen what kind of film it&#39;s gonna be. Super interested to see Ari finally break out of the standard horror genre(as standard as his movies are lol) and do something totally new. This totally looks like it breaks all genre conventions. Ugh, and it comes out around my bday :3. So happy."
"6981","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-20,"ngl ive watched this trailer like 10 times and it never fails to give me chills. this is the most hyped for a film i‚Äôve been in a second."
"6982","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"I think this is gonna be a lot scarier than the trailer is making it out to be... but I also wonder if this film is gonna have a more optimistic ending, or at least not be a straight up horror film"
"6983","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-13,"Man A24 is one wild film studio. Their stuff never disappoints !!!"
"6984","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-20,"this trailer has developed an anticipatiom within me that no other movie trailer has had. it evokes a sense of wonderment and hype, I feel both ready and excited to witness Beau&#39;s odyssey. And the whole time, I&#39;m gonna be rooting for him as if he&#39;s my favorite sports player or something. its hard to describe but, this trailer just makes me feel incredibly happy. I&#39;m probably overhyping myself for the film but, I don&#39;t care. as long as the movie is at least enjoyable I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m just so happy to see a movie of this kind be made."
"6985","Beau Is Afraid",2023-04-04,"I&#39;ve been following the production of this movie for over 3 years, and I absolutely can&#39;t wait to see it. From what I know about it, Beau Is Afraid has the very likely potential to become my new favorite movie."

"6990","Beau Is Afraid",2023-01-10,"Not what I expected but I‚Äôm really looking forward to it, the use of expensive cinema to translate Beau‚Äôs story is going to be fascinating"

My dad said it‚Äôs basically refusing to accept loss, to walk until you legs can‚Äôt then you crawl, you punch until your arms can‚Äôt then you kick, you study your books until your eyes burn then you listen to someone else.

The German troops resorted to scorched earth tactics during their retreat to Norway.<br><br>In future I hope to get more movies like this."

I cannot recommend this movie enough. 10/10 just experienced the whole breadth of human emotion. What a genuine masterpiece."
"7095","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-20,"Not just a movie. This was the most absurd, profound, hilarious, deeply moving, hardest hitting, and inspirational piece of cinema I have ever experienced. Genuinely. It is ridiculous yet meticulously crafted. I had tears from laughter, sobbed from sadness, and cried from joy. It shouldn&#39;t work, but it did, and I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it since I saw it. Please go support this movie!"

"7100","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-20,"I saw this film last night. I cannot sing its praises enough. I didn‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve seen something more ridiculous, hilarious, heartfelt, jaw dropping, and radically original. I want this to win Best Picture."
"7101","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-21,"1. Michelle Yeoh is always on point<br>2. We need to support more films like this, even if they end up not being the best, because it paves the way for more creative films and not the usual junk"
"7102","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-09-26,"My dad randomly found this film and we decided to watch it today. Throughout the movie we laughed and we smiled at the pure fun wackiness of it all. But once the credits came on‚Ä¶ we just cried. Both of us, crying tears of joy. We then hugged for about 5 minutes and he said something on the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to have you in this life.‚Äù That is by far one of the most heart felt experiences I‚Äôve ever shared with my dad. I‚Äôll never forget how much this film reminded me on why I loved my family."
"7103","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-06,"Just came out of a prescreening and IT WAS AMAZING. This isn&#39;t a modern masterpiece, it is literally a CINEMATIC LANDMARK. I hope A24 works their asses off to campaign and promote this for more people to see, and for award bodies to recognize. Through the entire movie, me and everyone in the theater was laughing their asses off in one scene, and then they hit you with a deeply touching scene that could make you cry. The absolute craftsmanship of this movie is nuts, it might be a little weird but i assure you, if you just let yourself into it, you will be absolutely love this movie"
"7104","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-02,"Just watched this film in the theater. This is definitely the biggest surprise and the best film I watched in a long time. Telling the core story of conflict, identity, and love within a Chinese American family through the use of multiverse, with an insane, bizarre, yet extremely rich visual style, man this is so good I can&#39;t wait to see it again in the theater."

And I mean that completely sincerely as high praise"
"7108","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-14,"This is probably the best trailer I&#39;ve seen this year. What a batshit crazy approach. Throwing everything but the kitchen sink in it and it all sticks. Color me excited."

"7112","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-03-31,"this is honestly the best most original film I have seen in years, not at one point could I predict where it was going, it feels so new to be surprised by movies these days. Loved every second."
"7113","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-03-18,"Watched this tonight at the Alamo Drafthouse and it was a masterpiece. An amazing blend of comedy, commentary on inter generational trauma, and existential philosophy. 10/10"
"7114","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-03,"This movie was so much more than I could have expected. Blew me away on every level. Very crazy and very touching. Loved it and cannot wait to to watch it again."

"7116","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-03,"I‚Äôm a film buff and this is legitimately one of the best movies i have ever seen in my 31 year life. PLEASE PLEASE GO WATCH IN THEATERS."
"7117","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-19,"Michelle Yeoh is so damn underrated. She&#39;s an incredibly versatile actress; she&#39;s brilliant in drama, action, comedy, or whatever else."
"7118","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-24,"Literally just got back from the theaters. This film is so different than anything else out there. It&#39;s so absurd and chaotic yet touching and heartfelt at the same time. This instantly became probably my favorite movie ever. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie!!"
"7119","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-15,"I need this movie now. This is the film we need. Creative storytelling. Inject it in my veins, NOW!"
"7120","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-17,"OKAY I am so excited for this! They shared the plot of the movie without any spoilers, looks like it will be funny and action packed, and its friggin Michelle Yeoh! I love that woman. Definitely going to watch this movie when it comes out."
"7121","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-02-21,"seeing an older Asian female character written with nuance, power and magic bring tears to my eye. its not representation, it gives an overlooked demographic their flower. Beyond that this looks fricking ballllerrrrrr"
"7122","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-07-30,"I know I&#39;m late to the party, and this movie has been out for over 4 months now, but this movie was just absolutely INSANE. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a movie, show or game that&#39;s managed to provoke such thought in my mind. At first, I thought there was no way this movie could be as crazy as people said it was, but it somehow managed to be even crazier. Just such an interesting movie that does so many things I&#39;ve never seen anything like before. I can&#39;t really explain what this movie was exactly like,  it&#39;s so unlike anything, but all I can say is that it was an absolutely FANTASTIC movie. I will definitely never forget this wonderfully bonkers masterpiece of an experience."
"7123","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-06-06,"One of the dumbest, nonsensical, random, unique, genius, heartwarming, well thought-out, well executed movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. This movie was literally everything at the same time. I was in a constant cycle of confusion an understanding.i enjoyed it quite alot. It&#39;s a movie that doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously while at the same time giving you a good story. It&#39;s meant to be enjoyed, not criticized."
"7124","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-07-11,"Watched the movie and it felt like I went to therapy for 2 damn years. It has a deep meaning to it that you just can&#39;t find in other modern movies. You&#39;ll laugh, cry, and learn to appreciate things around you. It examines nihilism, existentialism, and everything in between. We live in a world (or a universe lol) where all of us are just here on borrowed time when we will eventually  cease to exist and return to dust. But, if we choose to, we can make this inevitable journey of life to death a little bit more meaningful if we love, appreciate, and make the most of what we have. Because &quot;nothing matters&quot; is the reason why everything matters. :) 100/10 one of my most favorite movi- I mean, pieces of art I have ever encountered."
"7125","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-06-12,"I watched this movie after having a huge fight with my mom without knowing what the film was about. Needless to say, I cried a lot. The way this portrayed the mother daughter bond was amazing. It just felt so much like me and my mom. Fucking phenomenal movie."
"7126","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-07-25,"This is the most life affirming film I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs not often a film comes along that changes your life but this one did"
"7127","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-19,"You‚Äôll laugh, you‚Äôll cry, you‚Äôll really ask yourself what the hell just happened, but at the end of the movie you will feel something you may have not felt in such a long time. 10/10 for this beautiful storytelling venture into what truly matters in a world of many different possibilities. This movie will truly make you feel everything everywhere all at once üôåüèæ"
"7128","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-26,"I didn&#39;t cry until the drive back home from the movie theater. Everything hit me at once and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#39;t seem to stop crying, smiling, and laughing. This movie is an EXPERIENCE and was worth my time."
"7129","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-28,"For an Westernized Asian woman, Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is about my mother and me. Our struggle to understand each other on display in the deepest, yet most innovatively bonkers way. How all her sacrifices have brought me up to who I am and where I am, but also brought me down in a single snide. I will never forget how a film can bring me so much tears of hurt and joy."
"7130","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-17,"Just watched. I haven&#39;t heard a theatre reacted so strongly to a movie in a LONG time (I also live in a country where theatre audiences aren&#39;t super reactive). We laughed, we cried, we cheered, sometimes all at once. Like many people have said, this movie is a LANDMARK for cinema and storytelling in general and I&#39;m so glad I got to see it in theatres. You will either REALLY love it or REALLY hate it and I honestly don&#39;t care, JUST GO WATCH THIS MOVIE."
"7131","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-09,"This movie was a masterpiece. Felt literally every emotion. It has a beautiful message."
"7132","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-31,"In not gonna lie, I expected very little with this movie. Didn&#39;t expect a good story at all. But after watching several reviews, trusted people I decided to give it a shot. I can safely say that this is a hilarious movie, with good acting, great storytelling, beautiful emotional and character development, and superb cinematography. I don&#39;t cry at movies, but I almost did at this excellent film. It made me have faith in movies again, and I would not take that experience back!"
"7133","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-19,"This is the first movie in 3 years that I&#39;m actually looking forward to. Michelle Yeoh is one of the most underrated actors ever &amp; this project looks amazing. I&#39;m excited that I&#39;m excited."
"7134","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-06-16,"This movie shook me to the core and I cried like I haven&#39;t let myself cry in the past 2 years. I know a lot of people are talking about the inter-generational trauma within the Asian American community, but I must say, it hits home for the Asians living in Asia too (east, south east, south, middle east, central, ALL OF US). Joy&#39;s relationship with Evelyn was so painstakingly similar to my and many of my friends&#39; life experiences. Loving your family can be the hardest thing you do sometimes."
"7135","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-17,"Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis on screen together? Legend meets legend. Iron sharpens iron. No way I miss this."
"7136","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2023-03-13,"This movie makes you cry and then burst out in laughter 2 seconds later, felt like putting a large spoonful of sugar, chilli powder, and lemon juice in my mouth and chewing it at the same time"
"7137","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-03-19,"Something is so melancholic about this trailer, when she says &quot;I just want to be with you&quot;. Knowing all the endless possible lives you may experience as a person in the multiverse; rich, talented, poor, silly, perfect life,  etc.. where you are now is where you need to be, as your self and with the people you know and love. Forsure David bowie&#39;s music sells that feeling."
"7138","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-22,"This is one of the best movies EVER made. It&#39;s a mind altering cinematic experience that takes you through all ranges of emotions. The storyline and directing is exceptional. Michelle Yeoh&#39;s performance was beyond spectacular. One of the best movies ever made. Period."
"7139","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-08,"I saw this last week and was blown away.  Amazing action, originality, comedy, and above all else a well written and very heart-felt story.  I was excited to see the movie and was still blown away.  It&#39;s definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.  I&#39;m going back to rewatch it and catch all the things I missed the first time through.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  We need more movies like this!!"
"7140","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-17,"There&#39;s even an animated universe, this looks insane."
"7141","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-18,"This movie did the whole &quot;Multiverse&quot; thingy better than MCU for sure."
"7142","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-27,"Absolutely incredible! Everyone in the theater was laughing and crying and laughing again. It‚Äôs an absurdist social commentary, a poignant family drama, and a sci-fi/ fantasy action flick all rolled into one. I swear you‚Äôve never seen anything quite like it. 10/10 for me."
"7143","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-28,"My definition of a good movie is that there is no &quot;filler&quot; scene. This is one of them. Every take has its own purpose and meaning. It could be fun, sad, horror, ironic, weird, but they are all entertaining and carry a message. The acting is also phenomenal. Just go see it"
"7144","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-20,"I&#39;m actually pissed the movie didn&#39;t receive 9+ on IMDB. Movie is phenomenally written, directed and delivered. A masterpiece from beginning all the way to the end of closing credits."
"7145","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-04-07,"The fact that (if I&#39;m recalling the article correctly) that there is a universe in film in which she is actually attending her Crazy Rich Asians premiere is just...ü§Ø next level. This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE type of visual storytelling"
"7146","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-18,"Regardless of the quality of the movie, this has to be one of the greatest trailers I&#39;ve ever seen"
"7147","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-19,"Awww so happy for the Daniels! I met them way back when they were at Emerson College, and they were always such positive, smart, and creative artists. It&#39;s been super fun to watch them grow from college festivals, music videos, and now full feature films."

"7150","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-17,"There is no way that I am going to miss seeing this. Even if I have to buy the script and act out all the parts, I will see this film. It looks so good! ‚ôæüé≠"
"7151","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-23,"This movie was like looking at the most breathtaking piece of art you&#39;ve ever seen for TWO. HOURS. STRAIGHT. Hands down this is one of the best movies ever made and it is going to go down in history books. There is no film more original and creative than this. It is clearly a work of love, every minute of the film serves an overall purpose to build this incredible experience. I was so deeply impacted that I cried for a half-hour AFTER the movie ended just processing how beautiful this was. Buy it. Watch it. Love it.  ü§ß"

"7153","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-03-26,"When I see a movie I&#39;ve enjoyed above all else, I usually qualify my reaction by saying it&#39;s only &quot;one of&quot; my favorite movies of all time. After seeing this a few nights ago and not being able to stop talking, thinking, and obsessing over it, this is the first time I can honestly say... this IS my favorite movie of all time. This is why we go to the movies, and I&#39;m going to be chasing the highs and lows of everything this made me ~feel~ for a long time."
"7154","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2023-03-13,"This movie just won seven freakin‚Äô Oscars, including Best Picture. Congrats to everyone involved in it. Now I gotta watch it one of these days!"
"7155","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-06-18,"I&#39;ve rarely seen a film that deals with suicide, depression, and love for the one&#39;s we share our lives with. In the midst of hilarious scenes, there is real poetry and substance in this film. This is a movie I want to see with my mom to make her understand how I may have felt as a teenager, having had to deal with my own &quot;bagel.&quot;"
"7156","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2023-03-14,"Across all the universes, we live in the one where this movie makes history as the most-awarded film of all time. I sobbed a lot watching the Oscars last night. I&#39;m going to rewatch it and bring back all the feelings this movie has brought me. Just revolutionary!"
"7157","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2022-05-28,"(Warning: may contain spoilers)<br>I don&#39;t know why I bawled my eyes out in that scene between Michelle and her daughter when the latter said nothing really matters. Maybe because I can identify myself with her nihilistic notion that the idea of destroying one&#39;s self is the only way she could see to achieve peace, and I can really relate to that on a very personal level because I&#39;ve been in that position many times. The Everything Bagel was like a metaphor for suicide, and I was so glad that there was someone like Evelyn who made Jobu realized that despite inevitable failures and rejections, amidst all the chaos in the universe, we can still find tiny specks of pure happiness when shared with our loved ones, no matter how fleeting these moments can be, and that they&#39;re enough to make us feel alive and get going. Despite seeing boundless possibilities of greatness in other worlds, Evelyn still chose to be in that moment with her daughter, the joy of her life, despite all her flaws and queerness. The vastness and infiniteness of time and space may make us feel like we don&#39;t matter, like nothing matters, but Evelyn made us realize that we matter to someone. This film is an ode to parenthood, an observation into the mind of loneliness, and an exercise of acceptance, freedom, and enduring hope."
"7158","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-14,"The directors of Swiss Army Man directed this. And ever since I&#39;ve seen this film pop up on IMDb for 5 years now, its finally here!

"7159","Everything Everywhere All at Once",2021-12-14,"A movie about Michelle Yeoh going through the multiverse while doing some kung fu fighting? I&#39;ll buy a ticket now."

"7302","Journey to Bethlehem",2023-10-25,"As Pastor of a Church I was offered a sneak preview of Journey to Bethlehem ‚Äì along with my wife and kids.  This movie is simply outstanding!<br>This is simply a beautiful retelling of the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.  The costumes are good, the scenery and camera work create a worthy visual experience.  The actors are well chosen and extremely likeable.  This movie has managed to stay Biblically accurate and yet allow the characters to be human ‚Äì like we are.  There are real emotions and humor displayed, which allow us to connect more deeply with the reality and depth of this story.<br>I am trained in classical music and Theology and can say that I was pleased in many ways with this musical movie.  The Jewish elements of arranged weddings, customs, agriculture and travel were all well depicted.  I had wondered how they would handle the place of birth and was impressed that even in this detail this movie chose the correct locale.<br>Few are aware of just how dangerous and deranged King Herod was, and this movie along with a very credible performance by Antonio Banderas give Herod all that delusional jealousy and megalomania.  History has shown that Herod had his wife, her mother, her brother and 3 of his sons murdered. Banderas shows off his vocal abilities and truly brings his character Herod to center stage with a full range of emotions.  His song was a high point musically and dramatically.<br>The musical aspects far exceeded my expectations!  Several of the songs will no doubt become top hits and I have no doubt this will become a staple for High School and College musicals.  There is true musical talent in this music and even the coldest hearts will melt and shed tears.  This movie is fun, touching and offers a human connection to the Bible‚Äôs greatest event.  Suitable for all audiences!"
"7303","Journey to Bethlehem",2023-09-22,"As a Christian who loves Musicals like this, I can&#39;t wait to watch this masterpiece! Amen! üôèüèª"

The fact that it&#39;s a musical AND has Antonio Banderas staring as the villain, consider me already buying my ticket and watching it Opening Weekend. I&#39;m in, I just love musicals."
"7305","Journey to Bethlehem",2023-09-28,"I hosted a pre-screening of this film and will happily pay to go see it again! The music was so enjoyable, the comedic moments were really funny, and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; was delightfully re-told in a musical format.  Cast and characters (Fig the Donkey!!) were outstanding! Vocals were strong.  Choreography was authentic.  As a music educator, the most beautiful musical moment for me was when the shepherd girl sang &quot;Silent Night.&quot;  Do not miss this movie!!  Take your entire family! Ask your church to rent a theatre for a showing.  It was really well done.  Tutti Bravi, Affirm Films!!"

Also Fiona&#39;s face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFXcEWalXBI&amp;t=117"">1:57</a> is adorable! I am not her biggest fan, but I do love that little expression on her face. She is just too cute! I need to see this in theaters! I so want to see Jesus Christ in Fiona&#39;s tummy! What I mean by that is Fiona being pregnant with him throughout the beginning and middle of the movie. <br><br>Do I think that Joseph is attractive? Yes, yes I do. Mary looks too cute by the way.

From blockbusters to indies, action to drama, biographics to comic book adaptations, popcorn movies to artistic ones. He literally starred in any possible genre many many times. When one day he&#39;s done with acting he&#39;ll leave an amazing movie resume absolutely impossible to catch up for any actor."

It‚Äôs his perceive awkward nuances that over the years people have learnt to love. Rejecting the conventional Hollywood tropes and reaching deep into the parts of himself others dare not.

"7784","Dream Scenario",2023-09-19,"This is actually based on a known phenomenon you can read about (tons of articles, even sites devoted to it) where countless people have seen the same man in their dreams over the years who always seems to be just observing. There&#39;s actually a sketch of the &quot;man&quot; people keep seeing, based on testimonies from the people who see him (which, oddly enough, looks like what they did with Cage&#39;s &quot;look&quot; in the film). It&#39;s likely just some psychological composite &quot;man&quot; that many people form in their heads that <b>seems</b> like the same person - but for a screenwriter to turn that into a story about an actual man being recognized as that person and his reaction to it, is a GREAT idea. I wish I&#39;d thought of it. lol"

"7788","Dream Scenario",2023-09-23,"It‚Äôs great thing to see an artist truly being an artist, stretching his limits that is what an artist strives for, not the judgement of others."
"7789","Dream Scenario",2023-09-19,"Nic Cage has evolved over the years to one of my favorite actors. I can‚Äôt recall ever being so amped about an actor, every film he does now gets me incredibly excited, something 20years ago I probably wouldn‚Äôt have imagined ever saying. <br><br>After his recent films like Pig, Mandy and The Color Of Space I know whatever project he is going to be a part of is going to be unique and well crafted, something I really appreciate these days. <br><br>A24 is by far my favorite studio, I don‚Äôt love every film they do but I always appreciate the fact that they are making and supporting films that they do.

"7844","The Fabelmans",2023-01-29,"I saw this movie last night and I did not expect to be so profoundly affected by it.  I loved every single moment of it.  Every now and then I&#39;ll see a movie that&#39;ll reaffirm my faith in cinema and this is one of those films."
"7845","The Fabelmans",2023-02-13,"This movie is a gem. Visually beautiful and ethereal. I genuinely laughed and cried in many scenes. Will never forget this movie. Spielberg at his vintage best. Janusz Kaminski&#39;s cinematography took me to 1950s and 60s."
"7846","The Fabelmans",2022-09-11,"When Michelle Williams asked him ‚Äúwhat was your favorite part?‚Äù I teared up a little. It reminds me back when I was a child going to the movies with my grandparents and being so stunned by the cinema experience and falling in love with film and the industry. Spielberg is one of the greatest visionaries of all time and can still pull at my heart strings. I know this one will be great, this comes off personal. When that can be captured through the lens- true passion. That‚Äôs when you know something special is on screen. Can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters."

"7854","The Fabelmans",2023-01-06,"This film was a deeply personal experience for me, so many parallels to my life and family. Tears and reflection kept me glued to the screen for every second of the film. Steven Speilberg is a master director. This film is absolutely beautiful."

"7856","The Fabelmans",2022-09-11,"This feels like such a personal and passion project for Spielberg. Once again, another film from him that I literally cannot wait to see. I got chills watching this trailer."

I absolutely cannot wait for this film! The trailer brought me to tears, and I had chills throughout."
"7859","The Fabelmans",2022-11-15,"I remember when I fell in love with movies. When I saw the greatest showman in theaters for the first time I knew that I wanted to make movies.

"7862","The Fabelmans",2022-09-12,"I&#39;m just so happy for Paul Dano. The guy is a true believer in the power of a good performance, and he&#39;s finally getting roles in huge films. Good for him.<br><br>There Will Be Blood is my favorite film ever, and Paul&#39;s performance in it nearly matches the heights of Daniel Day-Lewis&#39;s. Go check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it already."
"7863","The Fabelmans",2023-01-11,"This kid film maker has all the right ideas for a massive YouTube career, then he gets demonetized and that breaks his heart. Yeah I can totally relate to this film. Lucky Spielberg made his films well before YouTube ever appeared."
"7864","The Fabelmans",2022-09-11,"Michelle Williams is one of the best actress of her generation. She&#39;s a chameleon in many of her movies. She can really dissapeared into a role especially for a drama movie. As a fan of her work, I&#39;m so happy to finally see her in a Steven Spielberg movie. One of few actresses who deserves to win an Oscar atleast once in her career üôåüôå"

"7867","The Fabelmans",2022-10-09,"Steven Spielberg must also be considered for nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  My mother would analyze Spielberg films as if they were literary works, among the greatest literary works and she would emphasize his use of fine literary techniques in film. The conscientiousness of Steven Spielberg films is a beautiful parallel to the endeavor of Alfred Nobel, and would also benefit the Nobel Prize in Literature forever.  His films have enriched humanity, and considered as literary works have shaped the heart of mankind unlike any previous work of art."

"7876","The Fabelmans",2022-09-11,"Brilliant trailer, I had quite an emotional reaction to it. Especially the end, transported me back to being a young child and after a movie my dad would ask what my favourite part was. And I&#39;d ask the same in return.

I remember being 6 years old the first time my parents put a camera in my hand, looking through the viewfinder...I never looked at things the same way after that.. grade school was stop animation videos and kung fu shorts...high school was skate videos and documenting parties (it was known that I always had a camcorder in my backpack..a camcorder I &quot;borrowed&quot; from the media lab) Went to school for video production, did a few jobs here and there in a already saturated field.... my mother always encouraged my artistic side, my father was a welder and pressured me into getting a trade, which I did... followed in his footsteps and became a welder...did it for 18 years... and hated it, the great pay was the only thing that kept me doing it.. 3 months ago I quit welding to work in a pressing plant making records...half the pay from welding....and I love it, I&#39;m happy and I get to network with other musicians...and I feel like I have purpose...I still cut videos for my bands and friends bands...so life is still enjoyable.....going to see this movie opening night!"

I had never even heard about this film at all, we just saw the closest movie to our time and went for it<br><br>It was genuinely so surprising. Didn&#39;t even know it was from Spielberg until I bought my ticket. And knowing about his early life, seeing him retell it like this was really something. Absolutely loved it and so glad I watched it blind, Spielberg has done it again. This hit really close to my own life too. The child actors were also surprisingly so good and everything felt like I was actually watching an 80s film set in the 60s. Incredibly immersive and symbolic<br><br>8.8/10"
"7882","The Fabelmans",2022-11-11,"As I flipped thru radio stations in Charlotte at night on 11/10, I came across a talk show, intermittently pulsing static but enough to hear soothing voices. A woman was heard questioning a man who sounded like Jeff Bridges. As he spoke, he mentioned Saving Private Ryan and Schindler&#39;s list. I focused in on the dial knobs of the radio as I sat in line at Chic Fil A. I thought to myself &quot;no way this is Spielberg&quot; He continued to tell stories about his childhood in which old veterans of WW2 would congregate at his house, have lengthy conversations with each other and start balling out of nowhere. Yep, Spielberg. He mentioned The Fablemans and now I m here! Thanks Charlotte NPR!"
"7883","The Fabelmans",2022-09-12,"I&#39;ve been a Spielberg fan for a very long time. Jurassic Park was my first real gateway to his films, and since then it has been an everlasting obsession with his films. Steven was the reason I decided to attend film school for college, and to pursue a career in filmmaking. Though the work I do differs from cinema, I would love to do future work in storytelling. I think Spielberg was and still is a huge inspiration for filmmakers all around the world. The Fabelmans looks to be a companion piece to Super 8 with a filmmaker following his passions. I am beyond excited to see this when it hits theaters, and I dearly hope that this film brings some awards to both the cast and crew. Cannot wait"

"7889","The Fabelmans",2022-09-11,"I absolutely cannot wait to see &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; this coming November, and it&#39;s wonderful to see Mr. Steven Spielberg&#39;s personal yet semi-autobiographical childhood in post-WWII Arizona, followed by his rise to become an aspiring filmmaker. Like Quentin Tarantino&#39;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; and Martin Scorsese&#39;s &quot;Hugo&quot;, or even Paolo Sorrentino&#39;s &quot;The Hand of God&quot;, &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; truly pays tribute to cinema, but in a Spielbergian wonder.<br><br>This movie is one of the most personal films that I strongly relate to because I want to be a film director one day, and knowing the fact that Steven Spielberg is the first well-known director that I discovered when I was a little kid. Can&#39;t wait to see more of this."

"7895","The Fabelmans",2022-09-12,"I&#39;m so damn excited for this movie. I haven&#39;t been this emotional from a trailer alone in such a long time. Beyond the gorgeous storytelling, score, and cinematography, I&#39;m excited to see him dive into aspects of growing up Jewish. When I was a kid, I always got sad seeing all the holiday lights up on people&#39;s houses and my parents wouldn&#39;t let us put them up because they were Christmas lights, they were not for Hanukkah, and I never thought it was a shared experience until seeing this also in the trailer. And as an aspiring filmmaker, I&#39;m so excited to see more about the life of one of my favorite directors. Ahhhh I just can&#39;t wait for this movie :)"

"8031","Big George Foreman",2023-02-18,"I always wanted a movie about his life, especially his comeback were he became heavyweight champion at 45. His story is super inspirational"
"8032","Big George Foreman",2023-02-07,"Im so glad that George Foreman has his own movie, his story is so inspiring. Most of the people think that Foreman ends in &quot;Rumble in the jungle&quot; when that was only a chapter. If anyone deserves love from the Boxing fans is George."
"8033","Big George Foreman",2023-02-06,"When Foreman got older you just wanted him to win.  His charisma and good natured attitude was gravitating."
"8034","Big George Foreman",2023-03-20,"I got goosebumps when they showed the fight with Ali and Moorer.  These are truly the greatest moments in boxing.  I am very glad that a film is being made about George Foreman.  It is high time.  This is one of my favorite boxers.  And his story is truly amazing.  To regain the heavyweight title after 20 years, and also to take into account the fact that he trained with Sony Liston himself.  Marvelous.  I am very glad that he is still alive and that he himself will be able to watch this film.  Many people around the world will be waiting for this film (for example, I am from Uzbekistan).  A real WORLD champion."
"8035","Big George Foreman",2023-02-05,"I‚Äôm sure George is sick and tired of being asked about his fight against Ali, but every single time he does he never says anything bad about Ali. Always talks in high regards of Ali, just goes to show how much of a humble man Foreman is!"

You couldn&#39;t make it up - its why I love boxing history and this great individual so much."
"8038","Big George Foreman",2023-02-04,"Foreman was a devastating puncher. However, to become Heavyweight champion for the second time he took some brutal hits, but never quit. That&#39;s what made him a legend.<br>Tyson once said punches start to hurt a lot more when you&#39;re older."
"8039","Big George Foreman",2023-02-08,"Foreman is a national treasure. This was long overdue."
"8040","Big George Foreman",2023-02-01,"Very nice and deserving of a movie! What George Foreman did and how he made his comeback, it&#39;s absolutely amazing and just unheard of. Nobody has a comeback story like that."
"8041","Big George Foreman",2023-02-07,"I was an Ali fan but I also really respect George Foreman and the destructive fighter he was. What I really respect about foreman was after that huge upset loss to Ali, he went toe to toe in an absolute war with Ron Lyle. He got knocked down multiple times but was able to persevere. I think a lot of fighters take an easy opponent after a loss, but foreman went to battle with one of the hardest hitters in boxing history. Respect."
"8042","Big George Foreman",2023-02-05,"Its about time.  I honestly cant understand why no one has made this movie til now, George&#39;s story is pure cinema gold.  I just hope they&#39;ve done him justice and made a great film."

"8048","Big George Foreman",2023-03-07,"One of the greatest sports achievements in History is what George Foreman accomplished. It is one thing to go through the intense training, running, dietary demands, rest schedule, weight training, sparring, etc etc etc at 19 years old. But to recapture the heavyweight title of the world at 40+ years old is A PHENOMENAL achievement! Absolutely stunning, particularly if you have more than a casuals observation of the sport. George is the last of the 3 great heavyweights of his era still alive and should be considered, at this point, a very precious resource. He also sings btw, and not badly, and spoke of releasing some music soon. I will DEFINENTLY see this movie!"

"8050","Big George Foreman",2023-02-09,"About time they made a film about this legend.

His life, achivements, experiences, personality and cultural impact was made to be re-made on the silver-screen. I tell you, I have since kids days loved Big George and he is evreything you could ever wish for in a role model for a kid/young man who is growing up and in need of inspiration.<br><br>The lead actor I have to see what he can do in portraying Foreman (something that is a difficult task considering his size, personality and look) but I tell you, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt based on how difficult it is to make one look like him.<br>It was far easier with Mohammad Ali or Mike Tyson or Sonny Liston or Rocky Marciano etc. in there respective bio movies.<br><br>Now I so look forward for this movie in April :-D<br><br>God bless you &quot;Big&quot; George Foreman.<br>76-5-0, KO&#39;s 68<br>2-time Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World<br>1968 Olympic Heavyweight Gold medalist."

"8213","Women Talking",2023-02-22,"&quot;Why does love, absence of love, the end of love, the need for love, result in so much violence?&quot; <br>..<br>I have always been in love with the story of &quot;Women Talking&quot; novel, admiring the similarity it contains to my favorite of all &quot;Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot;. And though, the plot of the first is not that much of concentrated, it happened to be profound the same. So the story is a little bit harsh and contains so much violence for it talks about a series of abusing happened against the women of a single isolated city in America in 2010, where women had no learning nor ability to talk for themselves which was a massive contradiction to the year the events are in. If I am to talk about the movie, the act didn&#39;t disappoint me at all, especially Ona, or as it was named in the novel &quot;the dreamy serene&quot; and Salome!!! which was played by the actress that I was in love with her role in The Crown &quot;Claire Foy,&quot; don&#39;t let me even start with August, which is the main character in the novel, however, a secondary one in the film and I think that&#39;s really a great idea for the feeling of contradiction and conflict when a male is telling a story of female rage and wrath. Also, I liked how the dark environment of the novel did not disappear and have been transformed perfectly with much unbelievable shots and conversations, though I wanted them to change the ending of the two main characters and the only love story in the novel &quot;Ona &amp; August&quot;. Anyway, this was really an extraordinary thing to watch and did not disappoint me in any sort. LOVED."

"8286","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"The intensity of actors like Skarsgard and Goth along with a madman director like Brandon Cronenberg, this movie will surely be a thrill ride. I loved Possessor !"
"8287","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Very happy to see that Alexander Skarsg√•rd is starring and an executive producer in this film!"
"8288","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Mia Goth sure is the new horror queen."
"8289","Infinity Pool",2022-12-11,"Looks very intriguing. I‚Äôm starting to become a Mia Goth fan. Her role as Pearl was one of the most craziest performances I‚Äôve seen these past few years. She‚Äôs not afraid to go all out and be unhinged."
"8290","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Mia Goth should star in every horror movie"
"8291","Infinity Pool",2022-12-12,"Infinity Pool looks intriguing. Seems like Mia Goth has been involved in more horror projects these past few years. Good for her. She really suits any type of role she portrays onscreen."

"8295","Infinity Pool",2022-12-10,"This looks scary and disturbing but because Mia Goth is in it, I am here for the movie! She is definitely one of the contenders for the title of Scream Queen!"
"8296","Infinity Pool",2022-12-16,"If you want to get a sense of what this movie might be like, go watch Brandon Cronenberg‚Äôs last film Possessor. It‚Äôs a terrifying sci-fi body horror with some beautiful and haunting cinematography. The story and themes aren‚Äôt completely fleshed out or brought to the most satisfying conclusions, but the visual experience and horror of it all are enticing enough on their own"
"8297","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Mia Goth is quickly becoming one of the most promising and talented new stars of this era. She&#39;s like what Florence Pugh was when Lady Macbeth and Midsommar came out."
"8298","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Brandon Cronenberg is a really good director, eventhough he hasn&#39;t reach the heights of his father&#39;s skills, I think he has a unique bloody vision that would&#39;ve made his father proud. This is the type of horror movie that Mia Goth is perfect at. At this point, she should just star in every horror movie that&#39;s coming"
"8299","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Possessor was so good can&#39;t wait for this"
"8300","Infinity Pool",2022-12-10,"As soon as it said Brandon Cronenberg film, I was like &quot;oh yes, this makes sense now&quot;. Can&#39;t wait, love Brandon&#39;s movies."

"8314","Infinity Pool",2022-12-16,"Possessor was my favorite film of the last decade. I know this will be a must see.<br><br>Only thing it‚Äôs missing is Risenborough again. Her and Cronenberg really knocked it out of the park!"
"8315","Infinity Pool",2022-12-12,"Cleopatra Coleman is stunning! She was great in Last Man On Earth"

"8318","Infinity Pool",2023-01-25,"Coming from the son of THE David Cronenberg, I have high hopes for this. Also, Mia Goth is really making a name for herself in horror. She was brilliant in Pearl and X."
"8319","Infinity Pool",2023-01-09,"I‚Äôm here for Brandon Cronenberg after first seeing Possessor: Uncut and following production of this for ages, Mia Goth and Skarsgard is an awesome bonus. The psychological elements in Possessor were unreal"

"8323","Infinity Pool",2022-12-29,"The amazing cast they have for this aside, this looks insanely interesting and I have no idea what‚Äôs it‚Äôs remotely about really and that‚Äôs how you make a good trailer. Definitely checking this out when it releases.<br><br>Edit: Also Brandon Cronenberg is a super underrated director, he makes awesome, insane body horror films with sci fi mixed in. Just like his famous dad David Cronenberg. (Guy who made Videodrome and The Fly)"
"8324","Infinity Pool",2022-12-21,"Editing in this trailer is amazing! The plot is similar to Black Mirror episodes, but it&#39;s interesting to see how this will be explored."
"8325","Infinity Pool",2022-12-12,"Possessor was great and this looks even better!"
"8326","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Cronenburg really has a thing for people being other people in some way, I like it, this plot sounds crazy"

"8331","Infinity Pool",2023-01-15,"This movie looks balls to the wall insane and its about damn time. The fact that they had to cut it from NC 17 to R for theaters gets me pumped."
"8332","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Mia GOAT!!! üî•üí™üî•"
"8333","Infinity Pool",2022-12-11,"What a cast! Never have this group in my mind. Very random but I&#39;m not complaining. Now where can I watch this?"
"8334","Infinity Pool",2022-12-18,"Mia Goth is just gonna be in every obscure horror movie til the end of my days"
"8335","Infinity Pool",2022-12-11,"Awesome, trailer gave away loads üëå üëç"
"8336","Infinity Pool",2023-01-24,"I love Brandon&#39;s work. Possessor Uncut was my favorite film of the latter 2010s. Mia Goth is overexposed to me. I&#39;ve seen her too much and its time she ranks up to something like a big tentpole because her days as an indie actress are coming to an end. <br><br>I will definitely see this, even if the actors involved aren&#39;t my favorite."
"8337","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Infinity Pool: Uncut still exist? I&#39;d love to see the original NC-17 cut."

"8340","Infinity Pool",2022-12-13,"She‚Äôs finally a star!"
"8341","Infinity Pool",2022-12-15,"Is this supposed to be science-fiction or some alternate reality?  Horror needs some grounding in a relatable setting and this trailer makes the setting seem pretty absurd."
"8342","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"Branden Cronenberg, that explains it. This looks very interesting."
"8343","Infinity Pool",2022-12-13,"Oh nice thanks for summarizing the entire plot beat by beat for us Mr Trailer Man"
"8344","Infinity Pool",2022-12-08,"We are all agree that Mia Goth is one of the best actress for horror-thriller movies."

"8354","You Hurt My Feelings",2023-04-09,"I love Nicole Holofcener movies. She depicts those little slices of life so accurately without being melodramatic and cringe. Walking and Talking will always be my favorite of hers."

"8363","You Hurt My Feelings",2023-05-17,"The Rilo Kiley song in this trailer came out when I first moved to NYC. It‚Äôs kind of my New York theme song. The person who edited this trailer did not know that but I am very excited to see this movie anyway."
"8364","You Hurt My Feelings",2023-03-26,"There is a new golden age of cinema coming and A24 is leading that. Love their movies and story telling. NYC has a million stories to tell!"

"8433","Kandahar",2023-04-06,"Completely by chance I was visiting Al Ula, Saudi Arabia when this movie was filmed (the Kandahar scenes were filmed there instead of in Afghanistan for obvious reasons) in December 2021. The car chase scene was filmed on the same street as the hotel I happened to be staying at; there was a car flipped over and police around (to prevent people from getting in the shot), and as I had no idea they were filming a movie I thought there had actually been an accident! Many local people were hired to play Afghani extras and given Afghan clothing, including the manager of the hotel I was staying at, who was Egyptian. It was really strange to see this sleepy Saudi town suddenly turned into Afghanistan over night."

"8499","Golda",2023-08-04,"I&#39;m crying over a trailer!! Helen be blessed. You played the Queen and now you played a queen again. She was a force to be reckoned with. ‚ù§ the &quot;right to left&quot; line!!"

"8503","Golda",2023-08-23,"I saw this as a play in Toronto many years ago, and the strangest thing happen. At the very end, the silence in the audience was overwhelming, and as if planned and rehearsed, the entire audience began singing Hatikvah and the applause that followed lasted for several minutes. I hope this happens in the theatres. Helen Mirren is certainly made to look like Golda, that I had shivers going up and down my back!  Except for voice, (impossible to duplicate), she looks, dresses and walks like Golda!! Another Academy Award, that is if Barbie doesn&#39;t take it!!! Never can predict the Academy voters, some of whom are outspoken antisemitics/antiisrael."

Because the quality of her work is always good, even when the movie is not very best (I don&#39;t judge about this one before I have seen it). She gives even te simple&#39;s, boring movie a brilliant extra touch. I don&#39;t know how.

"8666","Hypnotic",2021-10-07,"Netflix, make a documentary about the actual real work of that hypnotherapy does too! This actually promotes fear about seeking psychotherapy."
"8667","Hypnotic",2021-10-30,"It was okay, not too bad, not too good. I would rate it about a 6.5/10 because it wasn&#39;t boring, the music and the pace were okay. Yes, the lead actress was better than all the other cast members, but the plot could&#39;ve been more intense.

"8677","Hypnotic",2021-10-31,"Just finished watching this movie. <br><br>I liked Kate Seigel in her previous movies so that was a bit of an incentive for this one. A fine lady she is too.<br><br>The story is not bad &amp; the acting is also not bad. It is a really simple plot. No award-winning performances here though.<br><br>The suspense &amp; mystery builds up very slowly &amp; is limited after a while because everything is revealed &amp; the movie is about to end.<br><br>The movie is rather safe. It is not doing too much. In the hands of some other team, the idea could have been much better imo. <br>The potential is there but they played it safe.<br><br>The movie is short at 1h22. It left me on my appetite a bit. <br><br>I give it a thumbs up just because I am hypnotized right now."
"8678","Hypnotic",2021-10-05,"as someone who did hypnosis for 26 years, I can tell you this is as far from real as you can get. We can never &quot;implant&quot; a memory/suggestion and we can never make you do anything you don&#39;t actually want to do. That stuff you see on stage is people just pretending and wanting to be a part of the &quot;act&quot;.<br>What hypnosis ACTUALLY is helpfully used for is relaxation and stress relief. It can also be helpful for anxiety and trying to recall memories. But that&#39;s literally about as far as it goes.<br><br>Now watch how many commenters come after this saying it did &quot;freaky things to them&quot;."
"8679","Hypnotic",2021-10-05,"Remember her from Hush. Loved it. She was so good. This also looks very intriguing. Keegan Michael Key is now the official friend of lead character. Hope he gets a leading role movie or show, like a somber role."

"8682","Hypnotic",2021-10-07,"I love seeing Jason O&#39;Mara show up as a bad guy. He&#39;s fine playing the good guy, I like him in everything. He made a Life on Mars remake work so he knows what he&#39;s doing as the lead of a series. He just seems to slide into that psychopath role that much easier. Not sure what that says about him. I think it&#39;s his effortless charm and cool and he can make almost any dialogue sound like the most threatening thing ever while smiling the whole time. Especially in a smaller role like in The Closer. He was only there for a couple of episodes so he could really lean into it and you&#39;re never sure what he&#39;s thinking or what he might do. Looks like an incredibly unsettling series. I look forward to watching it."

For one thing, Neeson is waaay too old, I&#39;m sorry to say. Looks and moves like a 60+ year old, which he is; Chandler&#39;s Marlowe is maybe 40 at most. More than just age, Neeson&#39;s persona doesn&#39;t generally convey the edginess and wary+weary personality of Chandler&#39;s Marlowe. A Tom Hardy, in contrast, I could definitely see as Marlowe."

It seems to lack the notable witty banter that Marlowe was known for.  Neeson doesn&#39;t quite seem have the right disposition and sense of sarcasm to embody Marlowe the way that, say, Bogart was able to. (Again, it&#39;s only a 2 min trailer.) Also in the Big Sleep Marlowe was 33 years old. Placing his age in the late 30&#39;s as no older than 37 years old. Liam Neeson is 70. Big difference. <br><br>Having said all that, it seems like the filmmakers are creating a fresh spin on the character. (Which is good. There was only one Chandler after all).  It seems like they are going for a more straight-forward, gritty type of adaption.  And I&#39;m intrigued. I definitely plan to see this movie. I&#39;m curious how it will stack up and to see what direction they go.  So I&#39;m gonna go in with an open mind  These types of movies rarely get made anymore, so I&#39;m gonna try to just to appreciate it for what it is.

"8801","Marlowe",2023-01-18,"In this trailer, Neeson reminds me of a Nick Nolte role, &amp; Jordan looks like he wants to use Marlowe as a vehicle to do his take on Polanski&#39;s Chinatown, but anyway...in keeping with my tradition of checking out all Marlowe &amp; Holmes depictions on screen, I&#39;ll check it out, no doubt, but you know: machine guns, explosions etc. doesn&#39;t seem right in a Marlowe, as much as a Holmes, story. Could be this goes all out for entertainment like the Downey Jr.Holmes, but I doubt it. I expect Jordan won&#39;t be able to do a noir type character study, but he&#39;ll probably revel in a bit of underworld dodginess to give this film a bit to his taste"
"8802","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"As an artist who was fortunate enough to work on this, I can tell you there is SO MUCH more to see. Even as we were working, we knew this is going to be a special film. A lot of heart went into each and every frame you see on screen. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
"8803","The Amazing Maurice",2022-06-27,"this looks like a sanitized version of the book with much more human added. This is a DARK book with similaritys to &#39;secret of nihm&#39; or &#39;even watership down&#39; at moments.<br>There is a shot of sardines dancing in the rat pit, and its pretty clean considering it was filled with blood and dead rats in the book.<br>The two kids seem to have been aged up considerably and &#39;the stupid looking kid&#39; Kieth would never say he loves her. Maurice was not a nice character in the book till the climax, charming maybe, but hes a stray cat that uses people.<br>They will NEVER use the rat king from the book as a villain here.<br>The whole theme of the book was existential dread of what it means to be self aware"
"8804","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"I like the trailer but it makes it seem as if the film is focusing too much on humans and not enough on rats who were the real main characters in the book while the humans were tertiary characters at best"
"8805","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Please be as wonderful as I want it to be. This is one of my favourite Terry Pratchett books. This looks fantastic."
"8806","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-19,"Finally!!! Now I&#39;m satisfied. :-) Thanks to all the wonderful artists who helped create this movie."
"8807","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Had a great time working on this movie as a Character Animator. Hope the audience and Terry Pratchett fans like the movie."
"8808","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"The book that this is based on sparked my deep love of Rats. I&#39;ve now been rat daddy to many of these amazing little characters and all of them have stolen a little piece of my heart."
"8809","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-27,"Just look at the cat: an over-cute version of Garfield. It certainly difficult to imagine it being the cat from Terry&#39;s book!"
"8810","The Amazing Maurice",2023-01-26,"This... is a lot more bright and colorful than I ever imagined the world was in the book. also a lot... nicer. something in the vein of Coraline would have been much better."
"8811","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-24,"This is one of my favorite books written by my absolute favorite author. That&#39;s a high bar to clear, Sky, and I sincerely hope you pull it off."
"8812","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"Terry Pratchett + Hugh Laurie + David Tennant = Win"
"8813","The Amazing Maurice",2022-09-09,"Having just finished the novel, I don&#39;t think you could have struck further from the vibe."
"8814","The Amazing Maurice",2022-10-30,"I&#39;ve just went to the very first projection of Maurice the fabulous, at the Utopiales festival in Nantes, and I can&#39;t wait to see it again when it will be released. I hope it will be well distributed in France (and elsewhere of course). It deserves it, it is a masterpiece!"
"8815","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"Sky has a decent track record when it comes to adapting Pterry&#39;s work.  I&#39;m cautiously optimistic."
"8816","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"This should be on cinemas."
"8817","The Amazing Maurice",2022-12-07,"Now THIS is how you put Terry Pratchett on-screen. It looks so good, I can&#39;t wait!!!"
"8818","The Amazing Maurice",2022-06-14,"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents was the first full-length novel I ever read, so I really hope this movie is good."
"8819","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-24,"‚ÄúAnd I say take two, sir,‚Äù said Maurice urgently. ‚ÄúTwo of mine, and call it quits?‚Äù"
"8820","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Just when I started wondering when the next Discworld adaptation would be, this trailer showed up. Great."
"8821","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-20,"Always thought that maurice n co. would make an amazing movie...fingers crossed, thumbs held for a good translation."
"8822","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-24,"The first ever Terry Pratchett book I ever read üìö ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"8823","The Amazing Maurice",2022-08-10,"This might be my favorite book ever, im literally shivering getting to see it as a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"8824","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"I really hope this is true to the book and hasn&#39;t been changed in a misguided attempt to &#39;improve&#39; it. Looks great from what we see here. Really excited to see it!"
"8825","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"So glad this great book has been made into a film!"
"8826","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-19,"As much as anything, this is a story about stories.<br><br>A beautiful fable to teach about being cautious of fables.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait!"
"8827","The Amazing Maurice",2022-12-04,"I am SO hyped for this. I adore Prachetts stories. I wish they&#39;d do the Tiffany Aching series, it&#39;s my favourite, but Maurice deserves this!!!!"
"8828","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Can&#39;t wait to see this, but as I don&#39;t have Sky, might have to wait longer."
"8829","The Amazing Maurice",2022-11-17,"Just watched this film at a film festival. Didn&#39;t know what to expect but it was pretty good! I&#39;d like to watch it again once it officially comes out"
"8830","The Amazing Maurice",2022-09-24,"Hmm.  Can&#39;t say I&#39;m too thrilled to see a longtime favorite twisted into Hollywood taffy."
"8831","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Looks a lot wackier compared to the book (which was one of my favourites) but I&#39;ll give it a shot"
"8832","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"WHEN ?!?!?!?!<br><br>Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m a tad anxious to see this and inhume that little line on my bucket list."
"8833","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"I am liking the look of the trailer. Certainly feels closer to the tone of the books than &quot;The Watch&quot; did."
"8834","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-28,"Let&#39;s just say Maurice is incredibly lucky that Death likes cats."
"8835","The Amazing Maurice",2023-01-11,"It is unexpectedly good! The pit shocked me quite a bit (I&#39;m used to Disney Pixar movies). The voice cast are amazing."
"8836","The Amazing Maurice",2023-01-04,"I went to see it - it&#39;s quite a lot better than I expected. More of the spirit of the book intact that I&#39;d assumed."
"8837","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-30,"Bit iffy on some of the character designs but looks like it&#39;s kept the important parts of the source material<br><br>(Specifically:<br>Maurice - he&#39;s mentioned having tatty ears several times in the books, doesn&#39;t have enough of a street cat look to him at least have a snip in one ear would have felt more in spirit<br><br>Dangerous Beans - I don&#39;t get the stripes at all I think they tried to make him look overly quirky in a way that appeals to teens but doesn&#39;t fit the more cute and thoughtful feeling he has in the books  <br><br>Sardines - I just can&#39;t picture him without a straw hat I&#39;m not sure why they changed it to a top hat? The other rats seem pretty good though!<br><br>The kids - aged up a bit but that&#39;s understandable to avoid having to use child actors and it is a bit vague how old they are (though by their actions in the book I pictured them younger) I hope they don&#39;t try to make malicia all manic pixie dream girl girl boss or whatever the two kids learn from eachother in the book"
"8838","The Amazing Maurice",2022-06-15,"I&#39;ve just started reading this book and the trailer looks as amazing as Maurice! And the cast slays, can&#39;t wait to see it."
"8839","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-20,"I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!"
"8840","The Amazing Maurice",2022-07-06,"Omg!!!! Were doing this play at school in 1 hour!!! Im so nervous aaaa!!"

"8842","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-26,"Looks great :) I hope balance of &#39;dark sad&#39; :&#39;dark funny&#39; stays the same as in the book :)"
"8843","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-23,"I was really hoping to see this in theaters!"
"8844","The Amazing Maurice",2022-12-26,"It&#39;s good to see Sky making Terry Prachett adaptations again, I was worried Going Postal would be the last."
"8845","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"Also: never eat the green wobbly bit"
"8846","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Don&#39;t have Sky. Hope it&#39;ll be on DVD. X"
"8847","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-20,"I&#39;ve just got one thing to say to that:<br>Maurice, he made them high and lowly, he ordered their estate, the rich man at his castle, the poor man at his gate. Get back to the gate Maurice."
"8848","The Amazing Maurice",2022-06-05,"Really hoping for this movie film to be good! It looks ok to good, but the underground looks so bright and &quot;fun&quot; and not enough &quot;horrory&quot;. Also the tone seems far more humorous, than the book, I remember correctly."
"8849","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"I Love it, it&#39;s my favourite book..."

"8855","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-21,"Massive Pratchett fan but for some reason I could never get more than a dozen pages into the book of this. Will have to give it a fourth go before this comes out."
"8856","The Amazing Maurice",2022-09-15,"Personally, when I read the book I imagined Maurice sounding something like Al Pacino."
"8857","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-18,"Okay Iam interested, laughed at the trailer so thats a good thing"
"8858","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-21,"I wish they‚Äôd used the music from the musical version too!"

"8863","The Amazing Maurice",2022-10-02,"Feel like this should have been directed by Wes Anderson. He did a great job with fantastic Mr fox, another dark(ish) children&#39;s story"
"8864","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-19,"Is there a date and venue for a US release?"
"8865","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-23,"Very very nice thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíó"

"8868","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-22,"This cat really reminds me of the cat from Alice in the wonderland"
"8869","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-24,"Oh boy. I realy, realy, realy hope this movie will make a great impact. Maybe then there will be more cinematronic entertainment of the Discworld franchise."

"8873","The Amazing Maurice",2022-12-05,"I&#39;ve read every single Terry Pratchett book and consider myself a knowledgeable fan. I have serious doubts about this one. Isn&#39;t Maurice supposed to be a con artist? Aren&#39;t the human main characters are supposed to be children?"

"8875","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-23,"Please. Please be good.<br>Please. Please be good.<br>Please. Please be good.<br>Please. Please. Please.<br>We need this after that abomination of a live action series."
"8876","The Amazing Maurice",2022-05-23,"When does this release?!"
"8877","The Amazing Maurice",2023-01-17,"YES! I‚Äôve been saying for years that Terry Pratchett can‚Äôt be adapted for live action unless the budget is massive, sky and bbc NEVER get it right, it‚Äôs just cheesy and doesn‚Äôt do any justice. Now this looks awesome! Finally! I‚Äôm living in hope that it‚Äôs a smash and it will lead to modern discworld animated adaptations üôè"

"8881","Theater Camp",2023-05-18,"Saw it at Sundance. This movie feels like it was made specifically for me. And yet like it could have wide appeal. I can‚Äôt wait to see it again."
"8882","Theater Camp",2023-05-18,"The cast is made up of extremely talented and underrated actors, wow!"
"8883","Theater Camp",2023-05-23,"That first bit with the secret to getting the kids attention is 100% accurate.  The exact thing happened when I was a counselor at summer camp -- we had a couple of different call and response methods for getting the kids attention that I was familiar with but the new art director wasn&#39;t.  He was unsuccessfully trying to get their attention, then I dropped in with the call and response gag and they were all focused.  The new art director was like &#39;what was that?&#39;"

Liz Bernard was a young, sophisticated NYC redhead with a revolutionary vision of what Summer Day Camp could be. Man, she made it happen! As teen campers, we had &quot;Cotillion&quot;. We lucky guy campers held pretty teenage girl campers in our arms, as we danced together for an hour - while our younger sibblings hid behind the gym doors and tittered."

I went there as a participant, worked there, taught there, sent my children there. <br>They have changed very little from what it was like throughtout those many years. <br>Many of my dear friends who are now community leaders, clergy, and educators will remember those surroundings with a sweet fondness."

"9063","Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist",2022-12-20,"My only concern with this trailer is the quote, &quot;Cause I asked God to leave me behind.&quot; I just wrote a blog about that very thing only a few days ago. Asking God to leave us behind to help evangelize the world is the same as saying that we don&#39;t trust that God has everything under control... that somehow our presence is necessary to continue spreading the salvation message after the Rapture. If that were true, then the Rapture wouldn&#39;t be necessary. We could all just stay to evangelize the world. But that&#39;s not what God has planned. God is preparing 144,000 converted Jewish evangelists PLUS He&#39;s sending the Two Witnesses. Yes, with our limited human intellect, it may seem logical to ask that we be left behind, but we&#39;re not thinking as God thinks. We think small. God has a wedding feast planned for us, and for us to say, &quot;You know what, Father? I think I can be better used here on earth during the Tribulation, so thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Really? I know that the line is taken completely out of context, so I&#39;m going to wait to see the movie before I make any judgments."

I‚Äôm overwhelmed at times because both of my children are autistic. I‚Äôm struggling trying to support them and myself because like so many others. I lost my job as a social worker at Forsyth hospital because I declined the vaccine. I declined because of my pre existing health condition lupus and heart disease. I was denied my medical/religious exemption. I wish I could go back to the hospital but the mandate is still in place for hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. I‚Äôm waitressing and I‚Äôm so thankful to be working again, but I‚Äôm not making nearly enough to make ends meet.

Remember he gives us what we need, not what we want, on the flip side Satan gives you want you want, not what you need! Have a truly blessed day all."
"9097","Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist",2023-01-11,"On 12/31 I had an extremely vivid Left Behind Rapture Dream. I was standing in a parking lot outside of some tiny little church and there were 2 little girls that suddenly shot up into the air. I was so excited that I was about to be raptured, but then I looked up into the sky and I could see people from all over the world flying across the sky from left to right. We could hear them expressing utter joy and laughter. Everyone on the ground didn&#39;t say a single word but we were all just looking up in total shock. Those people around me didn&#39;t know Anything about the Rapture or they were always taught by the church that it would not happen during their lifetime, or there was only a mid-trib rapture. As the moments turned into minutes I started to realize that I was a Foolish Virgin. Ever since the Revelation 12 Sign, back in September 2017 I have been anticipating the Rapture to happen almost every single month for over 5 years now. I even quit my job and have been living as a minimalist off of my 401K. The Lord showed me through this dream, that I have been out of Oil since Dec 15th; when I was about to drive out of state for a week to spend alone time just reading my Bible and praying. My Pastor called me up and was yelling and screaming at me because he found out that I had just bought a Menorah for Hanukkah, because I don&#39;t celebrate Xmas. He quoted off a ton of scriptures to show me that my soul was now in jeopardy by my trampoline everything that Christ did to bring in a New Covenant. He said by me now trying to observe a single Jewish traditions, I now must observe all 613 perfectly! He wouldn&#39;t let me talk or explain that I don&#39;t observe Hanukkah the way that the Jewish people do. I&#39;m sure they have a very specific way that they light the candles, certain prayers that they say, and scriptures that they read, songs that they sing, etc. I don&#39;t know about that, I simply read through 40 New Testament verses regarding the LIGHT of Christ shining through our TEMPLE.<br>I try to forgive him several times a day every day... which only confirms that I still haven&#39;t completely forgiven him. I&#39;ve been back in town for over a week now but I haven&#39;t let anyone from my little church know that. The Pastor has turned the whole church against me so I know that if I were to go back I would have a whole list of others that I would need to forgive as well. So because I do not want to be left behind I am not going to go back to that church that is filled with gossip and backbiting. We&#39;re just too close to let any relationship take us to Hell.<br>The most terrifying verse to me this year has been Romans 11:25: <br>I don&#39;t want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited. Israel has experienced a hardening in part UNTIL the full number of the Gentiles has come in.  So the moral of the story is if we do not forgive others of their sins, your Father in Heaven will not forgive us of our sins!

"9102","Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist",2023-01-24,"Without context the line &quot;I asked God to leave me behind&quot; is troubling. I&#39;ll reserve judgement until I see the context of the statement. <br>In the Left Behind book Bruce Barnes was a pastor living in sin at the time of rapture. His wife was taken but he was looking at pornography during the rapture. Therefore the statement &quot;I asked God to leave me behind&quot; could be a snippet of the larger conversation taking responsibility for the consequences of his life at the rapture. If we who profess to be Christians but are living in sin are left behind it&#39;s because in effect we &quot;ask&quot; God to leave us to face the tribulation period because we know it&#39;s coming and we choose to sin anyway."
"9103","Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist",2022-12-01,"They&#39;re are a few inaccuracies here. One is the fact that the pastor said &quot;he was left behind because he told God to leave him behind.&quot;<br><br>When the Rapture happens God will leave no Christians behind. No matter if you plead with him about it or not. And most importantly it would be insanity to even ask God that. No one left behind is gaurneteed to live 30 seconds in the tribulation. There&#39;s no gaurnetee you would survive the beginning let alone the full 7 years.<br><br>And 2- a second vanishing? There is no secound vanishing. There is one Rapture and it happens before the tribulation starts. And at the end of the tribulation Jesus descends to earth to end the battle at armageddon and defeat the Anti-Christ."

He was also an amazing composer who influenced the teenaged Mozart and performed his music for the King and Queen of France.  I am working on getting the funding so that my Four Seasons Orchestra of Arizona can perform some of Bologne&#39;s violin concertos, symphonic works, and operatic arias. Donations to our nonprofit are always welcome.   I will be first in line to see Chevalier.  I put his biography into my book Fifty Famous Composers For Kids Of All Ages!  Bologna was brilliant and he is sure to amaze the World!"

"9126","Chevalier",2022-11-17,"These are the movies that send me running to the theaters. With that said I hope there is historical accuracy that comes along with it. Like for instance, Joseph Bologne was already a legit  accomplished musician before Mozart came along. Bologne helped create a whole genre &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot;. Not to mention guess who sampled who...? Still excited for this release!"

I thank the production team for representing my Guadeloupean heritage üá´üá∑ This looks like a very powerful and important movie, especially in our current political state in France.

"9171","Chevalier",2022-12-11,"So I actually saw a brief documentary on this hidden figure a day ago on another channel and became enthralled with the story as it much resonated with my history as a Haitian American. In my Journey of  trying to find out more about my culture; I learned long ago that the people of Haiti were the first to free themselves from French colonial tyranny. (Although it hasn&#39;t seem to benefit them much with France forcing them to pay back financially what they had lost as a the result of this revolution) These actions have definitely driven me to find more stories of others that have pushed against the mold. <br><br>I&#39;d encourage anyone interested in this trailer to actually look into the life of Joseph Bologne  before indulging in the Hollywood version of his story. As you might find it a more inspiring tale then that of a two hour long cinematic. I&#39;m sure Steven Williams did it justice in directing, and was sure to tell the story as closely to the truth as he could, so I take nothing away from what will be presented as I have yet to see the film.<br><br>I only endeavor to encourage all those who have lost their history to the woe&#39;s of time to be more diligent in finding and learning of the stories of all those who came before us.

"9195","Chevalier",2022-11-08,"I‚Äôve played the violin for over 10 years and never heard of his music or story before and it‚Äôs a shame because his work speaks for itself and he should be on the same level as Mozart and Beethoven."
"9196","Chevalier",2022-11-21,"Those is going to be EPIC! I&#39;ve read about him. He was  called the black Mozart  but truly so much more than that. I can&#39;t wait to see it. It appears like they&#39;ve got the story quite accurate . I Can&#39;t wait. ‚ù§"
"9197","Chevalier",2023-04-06,"As a violist, I hate it when these music movies don&#39;t even try to make it look convincing and they&#39;re just playing random chords. This bothers me."

"9208","Mafia Mamma",2023-02-28,"This looks good but I feel that April 14th or the month of April is not a good release date for Mafia Mamma. the month of May is more suitable and doesn&#39;t have a lot of movies releasing on that month. But we will see if Mafia Mamma can have a nice box office run in April. I look forward to Mafia Mamma."

"9220","Mafia Mamma",2023-04-05,"I&#39;m wondering how it rates on the scale of profanity and any explicit sexual stuff. I really want to see this. It looks so funny but who I take with me will depend on how much of that is on screen."

"9226","Mafia Mamma",2023-03-30,"Fairplay this looks absolutely fucking shit! I wish someone would just make a new serious modern mafia movie!"
"9227","Mafia Mamma",2023-03-05,"MEH‚Ä¶..Perhaps if they casted more prominent actors it would pull more people to watch. That‚Äôs the problem with most movies. In order to make money you gotta spend money and that requires a cast of actors who people recognize to get them (me) to leave my home to go watch a movie about the mafia. Then you gotta get half the Sopranos cast to star, which makes the film impossible to make which causes B list actors to star which in turn causes less people to go watch. Vicious circle. Tough to do but looks decent I must say/ üëèüèª"
"9228","Mafia Mamma",2023-03-30,"Man, Toni Collette&#39;s talent is wasted here. Somehow I managed to laugh less at this than I would laugh at the big bang theory"

"9297","Violent Night",2022-10-08,"I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy seeing David Harbour as Santa so much. He works so well for the type of Santa they‚Äôre going for. Can‚Äôt wait for this!"

"9300","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"I bet that the creative team on this movie just said what If die hard was actually a Christmas movie and now we‚Äôre getting this masterpiece"
"9301","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"Honestly I love this. Movies like this tend to be a psycho masquerading as Santa(silent night deadly night) or it&#39;s some sort of evil version like krampus. I love the idea that Santa just found himself in a house invasion, and is going to kick ass to protect the children.<br><br>I hope the reindeer get to do some cool shit too."
"9302","Violent Night",2022-10-08,"I never thought I‚Äôd be happy to watch a trailer where Santa goes all John Wick but now It brought a tear of joy to my eye."

"9307","Violent Night",2023-08-13,"Fun, violent, and wholesome, it might not be a movie for the entire family, but it&#39;s the best christmas movie ever."
"9308","Violent Night",2022-10-11,"Looks fun as hell. Finally something that isn‚Äôt about a evil Santa but just a bad ass Santa protecting a family from home invasion."
"9309","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"Honestly, it&#39;s like Santa&#39;s Slay but way more heroic. Those random gunners are also like the assassin group what Krampus always wanted to have. And that&#39;ll be nice to have a surprising plot twist for most fans"
"9310","Violent Night",2022-10-08,"It&#39;s kind of refreshing to see a Santa movie where he isn&#39;t just some mystical man or an evil monster. He&#39;s just a dude who loves his job (and knows how to kick ass because I&#39;m pretty sure he was viking in some legends)"
"9311","Violent Night",2023-02-25,"This movie was exactly like I was expecting, AND I LOVED IT!! R-RATED ACTION PACKED!!!"

"9314","Violent Night",2022-10-08,"I didnt realise that so many of santas lines can be portrayed as pure evil. And i absolutely love it!"
"9315","Violent Night",2022-12-08,"I absolutely loved this movie. It married die hard with home alone. I can‚Äôt wait until the sequel where they explain more on how he became Santa."
"9316","Violent Night",2022-10-09,"I love how he‚Äôs not just a guy dressed as Santa, he‚Äôs the real deal and he proves it multiple times.<br><br>Edit: Cool, lots of likes.<br><br>Edit: Cool, no more likes."
"9317","Violent Night",2022-10-06,"We didnt ask for this movie but now we so want it! Bring it on!"
"9318","Violent Night",2022-10-07,"Based on the trailer alone I think we can reasonably state that this might be one of the, if not THE greatest Christmas film ever made üôÉ"
"9319","Violent Night",2022-10-12,"This looks like more of an action comedy than the slasher I was expecting, and I am here for it!"
"9320","Violent Night",2022-10-13,"I wanted to be mad about a Christmas movie trailer playing in October but this genuinely looks like a good movie and I love David Harbour"
"9321","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"This movie looks like it came out of nowhere, and it is the kind of movie people have been wanting for awhile. Something fun, fresh, original."
"9322","Violent Night",2022-10-10,"This storyline is a breath of fresh air from all the repeat stories being told right now on the big screen."
"9323","Violent Night",2022-10-06,"I know John Leguizamo has played underrated villains but I have a feeling this is going to be awesome"
"9324","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"This genuinely looks phenomenal. It‚Äôs like a funny idea that you‚Äôd say would never happen, but they‚Äôre actually doing it. Awesome."
"9325","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"It looks campy, it looks cheesy, it looks kick-ass, and it looks like it&#39;s overall going to be a fun time."
"9326","Violent Night",2022-10-06,"&quot;Which one of you did that? Prancer? So UNPROFFESSIONAL!&quot;<br>I don&#39;t why but I love that Santa&#39;s line ü§£"
"9327","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"Seeing Santa save the day from bad guys on his naughty list is definitely gonna be intense!"
"9328","Violent Night",2023-11-27,"This movie was the definition of badass. It‚Äôs rated R but it‚Äôs just Santa messing up bad guys and I didn‚Äôt have any problem letting the kids watch it."
"9329","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"I had no idea how much I needed a film like this until I watched this trailer!"
"9330","Violent Night",2022-10-08,"Gotta say, regardless of whether or not the movie looks any good, the first trailer for a Christmas movie I get every year makes me happy that we‚Äôre nearing the season."
"9331","Violent Night",2022-10-06,"I never imagined David Harbor as Santa Claus and now I can‚Äôt imagine anyone better to play him"
"9332","Violent Night",2022-11-04,"This movie is a big middle finger to everyone who says Die Hard is not a Christmas movie and I‚Äôm here for it!"
"9333","Violent Night",2022-10-10,"This may not have been the Santa movie anyone asked for but you&#39;re not gonna get any complaints about the Santa movie we just got. This looks awesome as hell."
"9334","Violent Night",2022-10-07,"Finally...a good, wholesome, and decent family Christmas film! We need more of those. ü§ó"
"9335","Violent Night",2022-12-22,"&quot;I steer a little but the reindeers do most of the work&quot; LOLOLOL. It had me with that first joke. Can&#39;t wait to see this."
"9336","Violent Night",2022-10-06,"Loving the look of this movie. Humour, action and the aesthetic.<br>One to watch."
"9337","Violent Night",2022-10-05,"Is it weird to say that I had a huge smile on my face throughout this entire trailer"
"9338","Violent Night",2022-10-14,"You knew what was coming when Santa says &quot;lump of coal,&quot; but what I didn&#39;t expect was David Harbour breaking the fourth wall when he says, &quot;I gotta watch.&quot;  This is going to a fun movie!"
"9339","Violent Night",2022-12-08,"A cross between Die Hard 1 and Home Alone.  This movie was TOTALLY entertaining!!!  Loved it!  Two big thumbs up!  Awesome movie."
"9340","Violent Night",2022-12-07,"I saw this last night. It&#39;s so good.<br><br>It&#39;s violent and bloody, and yet somehow still an utterly sincere Christmas movie.<br><br>As Santa might say, it&#39;s Christmas magic, but I&#39;m not really sure how it works."

"9488","Living",2023-01-07,"Bill Nighy has a skill, able to reach into that little of my heart that aches, often able to bring gently quiet tears."
"9489","Living",2023-01-10,"There is more emotion and heart in this trailer than in most of the entire movies I&#39;ve seen over the past 10 years. This film looks amazing and the acting impeccable. What a treat‚ù§."

"9500","Living",2023-01-24,"Bill Nighy is always riveting. This is loosely derived from a film of Kurosawa&#39;s that was itself a cinematic tribute to Leo Tolstoy&#39;s &quot;Death of Ivan Ilyich.&quot; In that short story, there&#39;s not a whole lot of human connection. This seems, honestly, much better than Tolstoy."
"9501","Living",2023-01-06,"&quot;Living&quot; is but a remake of a 1952 B&amp;W Kurosawa film IKIRU (Living in Japanese), one of the best films ever made... I recommend that version"

"9507","Living",2023-07-27,"Excellent setting: GLC had not changed very much up until Ken Livingstone times! Name change to GLA was more of the same!! :) Beautifully acted and a real chemistry between the protagonists.  Very clever editing and cinematography. Brilliant casting. No I am not a bot, its just the way I walk and talk! :) And I simply love the cinema and we do not get very much of it these days! But above all I adored the pace... Must have been a real treat the day when they all read the first script... BRAVO/ BRAVA!!!"

"9551","Living",2023-07-17,"A beautiful gentle  film even though I found their were a few minor plot holes and some of the characters a little too simplistic. I felt sorry for myself last night in a crowed terminal, oversold delayed flight and a middle seat to boot.

"9561","The Menu",2022-12-05,"Absolutely amazing! I am a 30 year chef and to be perfectly honest...  not gonna say many kitchen &amp; industry people wouldn&#39;t smile and nod at many points through this film. As well, everything was so well done. Fresh new story, great social commentary, wildly accurate portrayal of how our craft has been compromised by social media, critics, and people just calling themselves &#39;foodies&#39; without any actually knowledge of what we put in to and sacrifice for our craft. This is by far one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen this year. Perfect blend of comedy, thriller, dialogue, and stellar acting. Really cannot say enough. I&#39;ll leave it with... the trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice and you think you know what this movie will be.... until you don&#39;t."
"9562","The Menu",2022-11-23,"The film is literally AMAZING. Not even a single minute of boredom. So unique and difficult to describe clearly it&#39;s genre. But for sure what&#39;s going on in this story will captivate you! Highly recommended."
"9563","The Menu",2023-09-23,"This is exactly the kind of film I love. It‚Äôs darkly hilarious, focused and immaculately executed. Nicholas Hoult delivers a masterclass performance. One of my favourite actors. Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor Joy are also electrifying. A true gem"
"9564","The Menu",2023-01-08,"Visually the film is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.<br>Anya was perfection in it. I loved how her character developed and how she managed to manipulate her way through the film.<br>It is very difficult to pull off a movie that is consistently thrilling all while being a brilliant dark comedy and The Menu is just that."
"9565","The Menu",2022-08-10,"Everything becomes a thriller when Anya-Taylor Joy in it"

Then I saw online that it was a satirical comedy thriller, which sounded right up my alley. I watched it without watching the trailer. That was a great move! I really enjoyed it.

I do believe that we need spiritual gifts but be careful to not desire that more than being right with God. It‚Äôs easy to seek signs and wonders more than seeking repentance and seeking His will. Please just be careful, and watch this through the Word of God. His baptized me with the Holy Spirit and told me that He will wants to give me more gifts. But I focused so much on the gifts rather than repentance and I made a fool of myself by praying super loud in tongues thinking that it will make me have more gifts.

"9917","Skinamarink",2022-12-20,"This is EXACTLY what a horror film trailer should be. No explicit explanation of the plot, story, characters, twist, etc. Just some eerie imagery with the dark voice over saying &quot;in this house&quot;. Love it.<br><br>EDIT: Just saw the film, and <b>phew</b><br><br>EDIT #2: I have come to the conclusion that this film is not for everyone, from what I can see in the comments."
"9918","Skinamarink",2022-12-08,"I definitely appreciate Shudder adding more experimental films to its catalogue. The countless variety is what I want and happy to pay for. This film is a hell of a journey. Kyle Edward Ball truly filmed the type of bad dream that lingers with you for the rest of the day."
"9919","Skinamarink",2022-12-08,"Horror movies don&#39;t really scare me anymore but I definitely got goosebumps watching this. I hope it&#39;s all shot like this, if feels like a nightmare."
"9920","Skinamarink",2022-12-23,"This is genuinely the scariest trailer for a movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It perfectly describes my childhood nightmares and fears. Also the sound design for this trailer (and hopefully the movie) is absolutely incredible and gave me chills.<br>UPDATE: call me a wuss I don&#39;t care but that was horrifying, especially in theaters. Loved the sound design and how surreal it was but it was very stressful and I don&#39;t think I wanna see it again"
"9921","Skinamarink",2022-12-18,"This might be the most effective trailer for a horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. First time I saw this trailer was in a theater, and it was such a surreal experience. Never seen this sort of take on a trailer before."
"9922","Skinamarink",2023-01-08,"It‚Äôs been years since a horror trailer has shaken me with chills. It has such a 70s vibe."
"9923","Skinamarink",2022-12-25,"I need more movies like this please it‚Äôs so immersive and every shot just feels me with an uneasy feeling so much anxiety I freaking love it"
"9924","Skinamarink",2022-12-23,"i was out watching Violent Night last night with my boyfriend and this came on during the ads out of no where. it was the loudest scariest thing i‚Äôve ever experienced in the movie theater. the horror buff in me wants to watch it but this i know will genuinely wreck me."
"9925","Skinamarink",2022-12-23,"One of the things that that makes this eerie is the voiceover repeatedly saying ‚ÄúIn this house‚Äù and nothing is said further. We‚Äôre left to our imagination as to what is wrong with the home. What is also unsettling is that the ones in danger are young children, horror movies rarely ever have them be terrorized, usually it‚Äôs teenagers and people who are older."
"9926","Skinamarink",2022-12-10,"this looks so terrifying in such a genuine and organic way. Very rare for a horror film these days. It looks like a very experimental horror film which creates an atmosphere of dread and fear. <br><br>Very few trailers have given me such a chill as this one I can&#39;t wait to watch it in its complete form."
"9927","Skinamarink",2022-12-12,"Early critical reviews are all good ..<br>The way they describe, it‚Äôs supposed to bring the kind of fears u experienced as a child.. word is it‚Äôs a chilling film. And full of suspense‚Ä¶<br>Can‚Äôt wait!  Love Shudder.."
"9928","Skinamarink",2022-12-13,"I know there&#39;s currently a dialogue regarding the sketchy ways people have used to view this movie before its official release, so I&#39;m urging everyone who sees this to please either sub to Shudder or see this movie in theaters if possible. We need to support creators who take risks if we want our beloved genre to stay fresh and innovative like it always has.<br><br>I know there are always issues when it comes to regional availability, so I understand that some people have no choice but to resort to piracy. Just simply asking people to make an effort if possible!"
"9929","Skinamarink",2023-01-02,"This is the best trailer I have seen in the last decade...and I&#39;m not joking. The perfect trailer, showing less and then, give you a real reason to discover the rest."
"9930","Skinamarink",2022-12-08,"Thank you SHUDDER and IFC MIDNIGHT! Looking forward to the theatrical release of SKINMARINK! (Can&#39;t wait for it to hit streaming too!)"
"9931","Skinamarink",2022-12-08,"the final shot of this movie is among the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen in my life"
"9932","Skinamarink",2022-12-14,"This trailer reminded me of something that happened to me when I was like 4. I usually slept with my two cousins (3 and 4) in one room. The room has large windows but when I woke up at night one day it was pitch black. I could see absolutely nothing and I don&#39;t remember if I wanted to pee but I got out of the bed to look for the door. The door was in front of my bed but I remember I walked in the dark and found nothing. Then I bumped into something like a tunnel so I walked on my hands and knees and got inside that hole (there was no hole in my room btw) the I came out but it was still pitch black. I gave up looking for the door so I started looking for my bed again, I was still walking on my hands and knees until I touched a bed and there was someone on the bed so I touched their feet and I thought it was my cousin but I kept touching since I could see nothing. From her feet I went up to her knees, then the waits and finally the shoulders. Here&#39;s the creepy part: there was no head. I was so confused and I could see nothing so I started again from her feet to her shoulders and I passed my hand from one shoulder to the other. No head. I immediately started crying. Another weird thing, as soon as I started crying I was immediately grabbed by someone from the bed, it wasn&#39;t a child because they hugged me and it felt like the arms of an adult and they started petting my head. I felt a sense of peace and fell asleep in the arms of that person. The next when I woke up I asked my cousins (3 and 4 yrs old) who was it who hugged me at night and they had no idea what I was talking about. They said they never heard me cry, that they didn&#39;t wake up at night. I&#39;m 36 now and I never forgot that night. There was someone in that room that pat my head lovingly, there was a little girl with no head on that bed and I don&#39;t know what hole I went into in a pitch black room looking for a door I never found. It wasn&#39;t a dream."
"9933","Skinamarink",2022-12-19,"The last shot of this movie, is genuinely one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie"
"9934","Skinamarink",2022-12-18,"This is actually a pretty good representation of what sleep paralysis is like."
"9935","Skinamarink",2023-01-12,"This is a great trailer.  The look of 16mm made me think of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then the &quot;1973&quot; briefly popped up, and I realized that was an intentional vibe the filmmakers were going for.  My only concern is that this trailer could be creepier than the actual movie, but it definitely has me wanting to see the movie.  The initial &quot;In This House&quot; voice reminds me of me favorite horror movie trailer VO guy from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s."
"9936","Skinamarink",2022-12-09,"That‚Äôs definitely a vibe that I can‚Äôt wait to catch in the cinema."
"9937","Skinamarink",2022-12-09,"It‚Äôs been a minute since a movie made me feel creeped out walking around my own house. It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. But if you let it sit with you you‚Äôll be rewarded."
"9938","Skinamarink",2023-01-09,"I don&#39;t remember how long it&#39;s been since I&#39;ve been genuinely scared by a movie trailer like this. I had to hold my phone farther away from my face, make a conscious effort to control my breathing, brace myself not to jump, and I had to exit full-screen before it ended (granted it&#39;s 1 am and my lights are off). I&#39;m a 20-year-old man and have been watching every horror movie I could find since the age of like 12. I don&#39;t think I have the balls to watch this alone, lol"
"9939","Skinamarink",2022-12-11,"It&#39;s been a long time since a horror movie  trailer freaked me out.  I can&#39;t wait to watch this film. Hopefully, it is just as creepy as the trailer"
"9940","Skinamarink",2023-01-09,"Genuinely not sure if this movie is for me, or if it wouldn‚Äôt work better as a short film than a feature, but man this trailer hits so hard I GOTTA check it out"

Christopher Robin abandon Pooh and his friends because he was growing up and needed to move on and now he has to face the fears of what happens when you abandon your friends.

"10346","Fear",2022-12-06,"Started as a 911 dispatcher at age 20 (worked as a dispatcher for 10 years).  The County I worked for had 911 Call taking, Fire Dispatch, and Police Dispatch.  I was trained in all 3, so we would rotate around every four hours.<br><br>It was always my dream to be a dispatcher, ever since the day my oldest brother had joined as a Volunteer Fire Fighter -- I was 9.  For whatever reason, I loved listening to the radio, and wanted to be the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; guy.  About 2 years in (I was pretty seasoned early on, I had a lot knowledge of the Fire Department, and was able to pick up things really quickly) my wife became pregnant.  At about 8 months, I took THE ABSOLUTE WORST 911 CALL OF MY LIFE.  I can honestly say that this call, I think about everyday.  &quot;What I could&#39;ve done differently&quot; - &quot;Why did this happen, when it was 100% preventable&quot;.  I&#39;ve had to write myself a letter, to the person who passed that day, in an attempt to express my feelings in words, and then burn it, but it hasn&#39;t helped.<br><br>This was 12 years ago.<br><br>I was prescribed Xanax.  1mg x4/day.  No one told me about the risks of Xanax.  You trust your prescribers so much and its absolutely mind boggling.  <br><br>I was on this steady dose (1 mg 4 times per day) for 4 years.  Unfortunately, one morning I forgot to take it.  I was at Target with my Son, who was 3 at the time.  And was thrown into a Xanax Withdrawal Seizure.  My right shoulder was COMPLETELY destroyed.  It dislocated on its own twice and then I had EXTENSIVE surgery on it.<br><br>Then about a year later, I again, forgot to take it one morning.  I had my Son.  We were in the car driving to visit my new girlfriend.  I was, again, thrown into a Xanax Withdrawal Seizure.  I wrecked my car, I was trapped (extrication had to be used -- jaws of life) and my back was really jacked up.  I was taken to Baltimore Shock Trauma (if you aren&#39;t familiar with this hospital, Google it, it is wild).  My Son was not injured, nor were any other citizens, only me, so I am grateful for that.<br><br>Because of these, all they did was put me on an anti-seizure medication.  They kept me on the Xanax. <br><br>Because of these instances, I was told to go to pain management.  The pain management center performed a surgery on my back.  They said I needed it ASAP, and I didn&#39;t have time for physical therapy.  Again, you trust these doctors.  Well, I ended up getting addicted to opiates, while being on the Xanax (still at the same regiment).<br><br><br>When I finally told them I had a problem, I was on morphine and dilaudid.  (I snorted both, I forget the dosages though).  They tried to give me Suboxone and I just couldn&#39;t do it.  I tried so hard, but I couldn&#39;t do it.  I asked for an alternative, but they discharged me with one last 30 day script for both drugs.  I was then forced to go to a methadone clinic.  This was so embarrassing.  After 2 years of that, I did the above detox.<br><br>About 2.5 years ago, I payed $30,000 to do a &quot;rapid opiate detox&quot; -- Basically I flew to California, went to a private hospital, and they put me under, pumped me full of whatever, I woke up, stayed at a mansion resort for 2 weeks, About a week and a half after the procedure, I was for the most part about 90% withdrawal free from the Opiates.  So it was totally worth it.  I never got these off the streets, or did anything other than prescribed pills to me.  I would snort them and run out early often, just go through the withdrawals for a few days, until my next monthly appointment.<br><br>I have been clean 2.5 years from opiates.<br><br>I am on Klonopin now. 1mg x3 a day, was my initial start.  On Sept 9th, my psychiatrist went ahead and started my taper to 2.5mg/day.  Its been super tough, and will continue to be extremely tough, but I have to do it, I can&#39;t live like this for the rest of my life.  12 years of these benzos.  I don&#39;t think I know what REAL anxiety is anymore and why its needed.<br><br>Also, I did a follow-up with a back surgeon that worked out of Walter Reed for a while, and then went into his own practice.  I gave him the paperwork of what the surgeon did.  He quite literally said to me &quot;Dude, I have no idea what the hell this guy did to you&quot;.  He said I am just going to be in pain for the rest of my life.<br><br>Unfortunately,  due to stomach issues, I can ONLY take Tylenol (which doesn&#39;t work anymore).  I cannot take any NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aleve, aspirin, etc...) they cause me to have bloody stools.<br><br>So yeah, Xanax jacked up my life in a VERY bad way.  <br><br>Crazy stuff.  Just crazy."

"10720","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-14,"Anyone who says the film is boring or nothing happens -  I went from  curiosity as to what was the cause of the falling out, to laughing hysterically in the confession scene with Brendan&#39;s character to complete and utter heartbreak at the ending sequence and everything in between - it was an emotional roller coaster and I&#39;m not sure how some people aren&#39;t seeing it.  It forces you to be introspective and empathetic.  We&#39;ve all been through the situation...maybe not as in-your-face as the two main characters but people come and go from your life and it&#39;s not always your choice, and you can&#39;t always control it. It affected me long after I walked out of the theater."
"10721","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-11-05,"Transports you to a different world. You start the movie, and 1 hour later, it is nowhere you thought it will be. Magic to see this cast together again! 9/10"
"10722","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Here for the In Bruges Reunion."
"10723","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Martin Mcdonagh is a man born in England who we fully accept, embrace and love as an Irishman. In Bruges was two of the best Irish characters ever put on screen. It looks like he&#39;s only gone and done it again"
"10724","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-25,"Beautiful movie about despair, loneliness, leaving a mark on the world to be remembered by, and the damage it can do to others. The theme of brutal and nasty humans, versus gentle, kind, nice animal loving people is so well done. The kid that played Dominic was a revelation. Excellent movie."
"10725","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"Very relatable problem with male friendships. You can&#39;t really break up with your friends! Best you can do is ignore em or be blunt and mean, and surely they&#39;ll take the hint and leave you alone right? Well, what if they won&#39;t? Love the premise (and the In Bruges reunion!)"
"10726","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-21,"Martin mcdonagh is a man who doesn&#39;t give a shit about what sells in Hollywood, he&#39;s a man with a commitment to true storytelling. I&#39;m always heartbroken when his films aren&#39;t  widely adopted by the general movie going audience, but I honestly envy his ability to digest and express the human condition in a way that makes every persons heart skip an odd beat in their chest when they see the baser part of their character laid bare in such a beautiful and compassionate way. This is a man who understands the darker side of the human psyche and expresses it in such a way that the misanthropy prevalent in our society is given a strong voice while at the same time being gently guided to a level of understanding and compassion towards those around us and their many failings and foibles, and I fir one can&#39;t wait to hear this man&#39;s voice again."
"10727","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-02-11,"Loved it! This movie hits home for me because when i was in highschool i had a best friend for years who then went cold with me and decided she wanted to cut me off. For a long time i tried to bring the magic back between us, and wasnt able to let go. I find it relatable and painful, but very beautiful."
"10728","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Brendan Gleeson is one of the most underrated actors of our time."
"10729","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"In Bruges is one of my favourite films ever, so glad to see these two working together again"
"10730","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-20,"Filmed on Achill Island, west coast of Ireland. It really looks like that. A beautiful place. Because there&#39;s hardly any trees you can hear the ocean at a distance, feel the fresh Atlantic breeze on your skin, and the strength of nature on your body is so intense there. A wonderful feeling.<br><br>Only a 1 hour flight from Britain to Ireland West Airport Knock (NOC).<br><br>Friendly people, warm pubs, great food."
"10731","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Martin McDonough is a great playwright. This has the hallmarks of his play, The Cripple of Inishmaan which I had the pleasure of performing in as a teenager. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this."
"10732","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-23,"Saw this today. 10/10. The writing, direction,  photography, cast and acting all superb"
"10733","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-29,"If you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs pretty much a metaphor of the Irish Civil War, hence the two friends who liked each other yesterday now at each other‚Äôs throats"
"10734","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Gleeson and Farrell have the best chemistry. So excited to watch them again in another film"
"10735","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-11-13,"This was excellent. It‚Äôs been a while since a movie covered such a gamut of emotions so extensively, and much of that can be attributed to the expert acting by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. The symbolism of the civil war brewing and creating tension alongside the ending of their friendship was brilliant. I appreciated that we walked into their lives having not seen what their friendship looked like when it was thriving, but at the beginning of its end. <br><br>For anyone who has had a friendship interrupted or severed, this hits a nerve, but not necessarily in a way that opens old wounds. I saw this two days ago, but it‚Äôs safe to say that this film will be on my mind for quite sometime."
"10736","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-08,"I&#39;m watching it right now. the moment when Colm is driving Padraic home after  he got beaten by the local policeman. Padraic&#39;s crying is funny at first few seconds but the atmosphere of 1920 life somewhere far away in Ireland in a village makes you understand that back then friendship and attachment to a person was important. it is a heartbreaking scene in this movie"
"10737","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-09-11,"Martin McDonagh is a true genius of 20th-21st century film and theatre writing, darkly comedic irish drama, and this looks absolutely fantastic."
"10738","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-09-26,"This movie absolutely incredible. Both insanely funny and painfully tragic, in a true Martin McDonagh fashion. Beautifully shot. I would say this is his strongest film yet. Colin Farrell&#39;s career best perfomance."
"10739","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-21,"I watched this movie very recently. It is a roller coaster of emotions. I felt so bad for  the friend who lost so much, he was really the only kind, normal individual on the island. I was enthralled by 5 minutes. I was not expecting the ending and cried my eyes out. It left me quite bereft and sad. Beautifully haunting. 5 stars from me."
"10740","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-03-05,"I can relate to this film because I ended a friendship. It was a great film. I&#39;m glad that I finally watched it. All four performances from Colin, Brendan, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon stood out to me."
"10741","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-12-18,"I would LOVE to see Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan get recognized for their pitch-perfect supporting performances!"
"10742","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-17,"I saw this film at the BFI London Festival with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson appearing on stage before the screening, and the atmosphere during the film at the theater was amazing. It has tons of laughs and shocking moments that makes the audience wince. It was a roller-coaster of emotions throughout and a great viewing experience."
"10743","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"So excited to watch them again in another film"
"10744","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"In bruges is my all time favourite film and brendan gleeson is always phenomenal, the guard, the general and calvary are 3 massively underrated films in my opinion so can&#39;t wait to see this"
"10745","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-28,"It&#39;s difficult to pinpoint exactly what it was but this film really touched a chord with me. I cried my eyes out watching it. It was so freeing. Movies are really magical when they can make that kind of thing happen... They open up for emotions you didn&#39;t even knew you were repressing. Loved it but I also won&#39;t be watching it again any time soon."
"10746","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-07,"Have always wanted to see Gleeson and Collin work together again since I saw &quot;In Bruges&quot;.. Wonderful chemistry!!"
"10747","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"oh my dear god, there&#39;s hope for cinema."
"10748","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-19,"I finally watched this film. Loved Colin and Brendan&#39;s chemistry in &quot;In Bruges&quot; and I&#39;ve been a fan of Brendan since his Hamish role in &quot;Braveheart.&quot;  I really appreciate this refreshing story on multiple levels and love how Martin McDonagh keeps the audience engaged--and in suspense. The scenery is another major character in the film and McDonagh used it as brilliantly as David Lean did in his films. At some moments, I was taken back to another Irish film &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; (1994) when it came to asking the questions &quot;What is community?,&quot;  &quot;What are our responsibilities to and for each other? &quot;What do we owe ourselves?&quot;  I also highly recommend watching the films &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; (2007) if you&#39;re not familiar with the Irish Civil War of 1922-1923. You don&#39;t need to be aware of this subject matter to understand &quot;Banshees of Inisherin&quot;; yet knowing the political and emotional landscape of what was happening across Ireland at the same time gives this film an extra layer of poignancy. These are unforgettable characters and the whole cast was excellent."
"10749","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-24,"you guys need to watch this, I have never loved film like this before. what a sentimental yet witty play of a plot, beautifully executed with brilliant performances"
"10750","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Love Martin McDonagh, he makes so few films every one feels like an event."
"10751","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-12-24,"I love this film! Im so glad that people can still make films that are worth watching."
"10752","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-17,"I am so intrigued by the plot of this movie. We&#39;ve all been through something like this. Where you&#39;ve lost a friend. Sometimes it&#39;s just over time and you&#39;ve grown apart or it&#39;s something you&#39;ve done or the other person has done.<br>But just deciding one day to no longer be friends with someone for seemingly no justifiable reason is an interesting plot."
"10753","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-12-25,"Grudge should be an entire genre of film. &quot;We won&#39;t call it quits. We&#39;ll call it the start&quot; makes me wonder how this grudge then plays out over generations. Just brilliant, best film of the year."
"10754","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Such a simple premise yet so mysterious. Why won&#39;t he talk to his buddy!?!?!?"
"10755","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-02-02,"Brilliantly written and the acting of all characters is beyond impeccable. Such layered performances. The film is a masterpiece! Deserves every kudos its been getting."
"10756","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"Mcdonagh is a rare kind of artist, I have to say. Every movie is an event, something you can feel has slowly been coming to fruition for years. And like wine ages and gets better, so do his ideas - no hollywoodism there, just pure inspiration."
"10757","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-05-19,"I watched it on a plane, knowing nothing about the story and I loved it so much. Definitely my favourite film of the year so far."
"10758","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"Can‚Äôt wait for this. I loved the chemistry these two had in In Bruges."
"10759","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"It&#39;s just magnificent to see a Martin McDonagh movie coming out. Who knows this movie might win him an Oscar"
"10760","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Definitely feels like a play he wrote and put on a shelf that he turned into a movie. Let&#39;s just hope it works as a movie too. His styles with the two mediums are different and this feels a lot more like Cripple of Inishman than In Bruge."
"10761","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"You had me at Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson directed by Martin McDonagh"
"10762","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-19,"I think the scariest thing about this scene is the jarring contrast between the indifference of Gleeson&#39;s character and Farrell&#39;s desperation and pleading. It&#39;s like his character just cannot compute how this has come to pass, while Gleeson&#39;s character has moved on long ago and doesn&#39;t give two shits about this so called &quot;friendship&quot;. He has abandoned not only the friendship but all feelings for his former companion without any resolve. Having your friend leave you is one thing, but the sheer indifference Brendan shows... that shit&#39;s scarier than a horror movie."
"10763","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Nice to see Gleason and Farrell together on stage again. In Bruges was a class film. There are many, many good Irish films. Man About Dog is great and The Guard is excellent."
"10764","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-09-18,"I could tell this was Martin McDonagh&#39;s writing just from listening to the first few lines of dialogue. I didn&#39;t know his name by heart, except that I <b>loved</b> In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. What a phenomenal writer to be that identifiable. I can&#39;t wait to watch this film. I&#39;m really hoping it brings Colin Farrell his first Oscar nomination; he has been doing superb work for decades."
"10765","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-11,"Was lucky enough to see this last night.  It‚Äôs pretty spectacular!  The trailer does a good job of capturing its immediate charm, but doesn‚Äôt outsell or spoil .  Fantastic movie, fantastic trailer, go watch it in a cinema if you get a chance, or otherwise just watch it, because it‚Äôs pretty great!  Best film I‚Äôve seen in a decent while"
"10766","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-08,"Gleeson and Farrel reunited‚Äîwhat a blessing! In Bruge was outstanding!"
"10767","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"Loved Colin and Brendan in In Bruges. Can&#39;t wait to see them sharing a screen together again."
"10768","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-03-29,"I was in awe the entire time when watching this at the movie theatre. First time since Covid. I absolutely loved it. The acting was excellent. The definition of a pure masterpiece."
"10769","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my little donkey‚Äôs shite, it was my little pony‚Äôs shite, which shows how much you were you listening‚Äù<br><br>Only Martin McDonagh could write a line like that that‚Äôs so sad AND funny at the same time!"
"10770","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"The most Irish conflict ever"
"10771","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-02-26,"Just rewatched this film again and I really think it&#39;s one of my top favorite movies of all time. The acting, the message, the scenery, it&#39;s so freaking unique and well done...I&#39;m sure I will watch it again and again."
"10772","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"This was filmed in Achill Island, I spent many the summer there. However if I got a pair of shears to my fingers for every sunny day I had there. I‚Äôd have 10 fecking fingers left! But seriously looking forward to this."
"10773","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-09,"This movie looks great &amp; stuffed with talent..but also what a treat to see a film trailer that doesn‚Äôt give anything away. <br>I can‚Äôt guess the plot at all, which is so welcome in an era where trailers show enough of the setpieces &amp; plot points to predict events."
"10774","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"The first trailer I&#39;ve seen in years that made me smile and want to see the movie."
"10775","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"This trailer has put a smile on my face after many months."
"10776","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-02-16,"What a monumental, magical and beautiful piece of art. This is what cinema really stands for."
"10777","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"Yep, definitely seeing this. Love McDonagh&#39;s work and I&#39;m glad that he takes his time with his choice of projects. Goes to show that quantity doesn&#39;t always equal quality."
"10778","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-07,"Finally watched In Bruges for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I loved the dynamic between Colin and Brendan. Will definitely be checking this out"

"10781","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"This is real film making, real story telling. Beautifully observed and told by master craftsmen."
"10782","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-04,"I think this was one of the best movies ever made. Def speaks to me in a light hearted yet weird way"
"10783","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"Makes me want to go to Ireland again. Those accents."
"10784","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-09-05,"Can&#39;t wait for this. We need more Irish cinema and shows!"
"10785","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-14,"The film is set near the end of the Irish Civil War. When P√°draig&#39;s sister goes to start a new job on the mainland, she sends a letter back to him saying, &quot;people aren&#39;t as bitter as they are back on the island&quot;. It&#39;s a small detail, but it reveals something interesting. <br>The Irish Civil War left a lot of bitterness on both sides, especially during the war and in its immediate aftermath. Yet even though the civil war never reached the island of Inisherin, P√°draic&#39;s sister thinks that people on the island were more bitter than they were on the mainland. <br>Loneliness and isolation on the island seemingly left many people bitter and spiteful because they felt they had wasted their lives doing almost nothing. <br>Colm and P√°draic&#39;s sister become aware that they are wasting away their lives, so they seek to remedy their situations rather than remaining stuck in a rut, like P√°draic and so many other inhabitants on the island.<br>Colm seeks to establish a legacy for himself as a traditional Irish musician, while P√°draic&#39;s sister aims to establish herself and seek work on the mainland. <br>There is a classical piece of Irish literature called &quot;An tOile√°nach&quot; (meaning &quot;The Islander&quot;/&quot;The Islandman&quot;) that many Irish students study in school. It&#39;s set in a similar environment to the movie, on an island (&quot;An Blascaod M√≥r&quot;/&quot;Great Blasket Island&quot;) off the coast of the west of Ireland. While the book is in Irish (Gaelic), English translations are available. The atmosphere and some of the themes of that book seem to be very similar to this movie."
"10786","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-09-04,"Hell yes, this is what I&#39;ve been waiting for ever since Three Billboards, and to have Colin and Brendan in his movie again makes an already awesome thing even better! Can&#39;t wait!"
"10787","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-23,"just saw this Movie- Funny,Sad   an absolute classic -restored my faith in cinema . Don&#39;t miss it"

Cannot wait!"
"10796","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-10-29,"Saw this film lastnigh. Brilliant from start to finish. I hardly ever go to the cinema. This film made me go to the cinema! The world has another classic!"

"10799","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-05,"I remember working on the mainland near the ferries the day they went out filming this in the Aran islands hoping to see Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleason or Barry Keoghan when they came back out from filming, unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to see them but at least I‚Äôll get to finally see this film that I‚Äôve heard so much about, looks promising and I have total faith in Martin McDonagh that this film will be a good one."
"10800","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-01-03,"Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time. If you‚Äôre intrigued by the synopsis you‚Äôll  love the movie"

"10811","The Banshees of Inisherin",2022-08-04,"The audience reaction to In Bruges was incredible. I always try to see McDonough films with a live audience because he&#39;s got a knack for getting reactions out of people."
"10812","The Banshees of Inisherin",2023-03-11,"the film shows, amongst many other aspects, the mighty power of withdrawal of communication, it&#39;s cause and how it can lead to destruction and suffering. a very modern topic. withdrawal of communication as a power tool which can lead to change of character of the person who is at the receiving end and cause an avalanche of destruction without end."

"10819","The Quiet Girl",2023-02-17,"A very special movie and very moving. Beautifully filmed, scripted and acted. For me the ending was quite emotional, and made me want to go and hug my young children forever. Little children are such beautiful things, so precious and so vulnerable. They need unconditional love and a solid foundation and this movie really captures all of this. Warm thanks from Sydney - Dave (my wife has Irish heritage so it was doubly special)!"

"10832","The Quiet Girl",2022-12-21,"Subdued but deep and haunting drama.<br>I don&#39;t know how the credit should be split between the child actor and the director but there&#39;s plenty to go around. This film oozes with talent and humanity.<br>And those trees...I paused here and there and lost myself in the scenery. Isn&#39;t Ireland special?<br>My only gripe is with the well. I get that they are farmers but a bit of childproofing never killed anyone, quite the opposite, especially after what happened."
"10833","The Quiet Girl",2023-01-05,"I fell in love with this film..the Irish spoken language made it ever more special..I was championing for this little one all the way through, the neglect &amp; the suffering in silence..then moved into somewhere strange and watching all three of them flourish together as a little family. Each knowing this was the best thing for them all. Taking little one back I was pleading ü•∫ all the way in that car journey back that they would ask if they could keep her permanently...then they left and I literally sobbed saying NO this can&#39;t be it surely..then she runs after them like she&#39;s running for her life..she runs into he&#39;s arms &amp; grabs onto him to tightly never wanting to let them go..then dad comes towards them...she whispers it dad...dad. my ending was she went back with them and stayed there at the farm. Being loved and looked after properly the way she deserves. This film was Irish cinema at its beat.. it was my best film in 2022. Brilliant."

"10853","BlackBerry",2023-03-28,"People need to cast Glenn Howerton in more movies, man is a fantastic actor, a golden god even"
"10854","BlackBerry",2023-03-16,"Hope Glenn Howerton continues to get more dramatic and black comedy roles because the reviews say he kills it here! His acting is so underrated on Sunny."
"10855","BlackBerry",2023-03-15,"The first half of the trailer won me over, but the ProZD appearance completely sold me"

I feel like Matt took every type of media I enjoyed and brought the actors together lol. I&#39;m so intrigued by this, and it looks so natural and interesting! I love Matt Johnson, hope this is great!"
"10859","BlackBerry",2023-03-15,"We are all going to love this movie.... because of the implication"
"10860","BlackBerry",2023-05-04,"Glenn Howerton is one hell of an actor and he hasn‚Äôt even peaked."
"10861","BlackBerry",2023-03-18,"I can&#39;t wait to see this. No matter what anyone says we owe the rise of smartphones to Blackberry. Their Achilles heel was to focus too much on the business side that when the iPhone and Android came along they didn&#39;t see them as serious competition until it was too late. This looks like it it&#39;ll be so good."
"10862","BlackBerry",2023-03-16,"All these new movies valorizing product creation like they&#39;re the greatest dramatic storylines of our time."
"10863","BlackBerry",2023-03-15,"So happy for Matt Johnson. This looks great."

"10866","BlackBerry",2023-03-16,"Glad to see BlackBerry get the limelight. iPhone and Android owe so much to them. My BlackBerry was such a better device in terms of productivity and accuracy of typing than my iPhone ever has been."

"11357","T√°r",2022-09-29,"Cate received an 8 minute standing ovation in Venice for this film. She is a legend of her time, most film critics agree to this. As an actress she is completely fearless, and loses herself in each role she plays. I see her on screen and marvel at her talent. She&#39;s mesmerising and so is her voice - rich, deep, resonant. What a combination of skills!"
"11358","T√°r",2022-10-24,"I have seen a trend lately, to going back to ambiguous trailers, giving you a a taste of the movie without spoiling it. Giving the audience a chance to go and see a movie in the theatre, knowing what they saw, was not only compelling but intriguing, without knowing the overall story and I am loving every second of it. Count me in for this one."
"11359","T√°r",2022-10-08,"Cate Blanchett is a true artist. Her filmography is so diverse. She is a master at the more serious roles, but isn‚Äôt afraid to dive into comedy. She is so well rounded and it‚Äôs not often an actor can play different genres so well!"
"11360","T√°r",2022-11-07,"I&#39;ve never seen anything like this movie. The script blew my mind - tying music, identity, and art - and the discourse around ego, cancellation, and value of beauty - brilliant.  Cate Blanchett was compelling, mesmerizing, brilliant, and pioneering. No one else could have pulled this off at this level of excellence.  Bravo, Maestro."
"11361","T√°r",2022-09-28,"If there is any working actor today who deserves more than 3 Oscars, it&#39;s Cate Blanchett. She&#39;s an acting legend and clear lock for best actress oscars 2023."
"11362","T√°r",2023-03-13,"Cate, you deserved that Oscar, i was for Michelle yeoh getting it. But then watched this masterpiece. This was so deep and you were outstanding."
"11363","T√°r",2022-10-16,"I saw it last night, and Cate Blanchett continues to blow my mind with her powerful performances. Victim or villain? Her portrayal of the fictional character Lydia T√°r and the film‚Äôs production values were all next level. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this incredible work of art!"
"11364","T√°r",2022-09-28,"Having seen the film I can assure, you are in a treat for master class acting from Cate Blanchett. She completely operates on different level any actors would dare dream of. This is a nuanced character study that will nothing but astound you. Cate Blanchett is sure shot lock for win Best actress next year. Have not seen any performance that has surpassed her this year, male or female. <br>If you had to compare, she&#39;s mixture of Daniel day lewis in &#39;There will be blood&#39; and Natalie Portman in &#39;Black Swan&#39; but more subtle yet layered performance, that&#39;s impossible to ignore. I get why Todd Field had written this script for Ms Blanchett. There&#39;s no one but only Blanchett can pull this off. I can not imagine someone beating her for the Oscar. In fact her acting goes even beyond getting recognised with a golden trophy. This performance will be remembered in cinema history being one of the best if not the best."

"11367","T√°r",2022-11-27,"Incredible film. And as a former classical pianist, the amount of research in the classical music world was so seamless and astounding to me. When she was explaining a Bach prelude to a student, it was exactly how a pianist studies Bach using voicing and dialogue. I was amazed at the deep references of an obscure composer Kalinnikov, the reference of atonality, and her conducting style very in the style of Bernstein (which there are documentaries of Bernstein conducting Mahler). Such a damn good film"
"11368","T√°r",2023-01-29,"Tar is an absolute classic. one of the best movies of all time.  It&#39;s so good, you can keep binge watching this movie over and over."
"11369","T√°r",2022-10-26,"This movie is a masterpiece on several levels, not least of which are Cate Blanchett&#39;s transformational performance and Todd Field&#39;s long-awaited return to writing and directing. There are a lot of ways to read the movie but on a purely atmospheric note, I think it&#39;s the best horror movie of 2022 by a mile."
"11370","T√°r",2023-06-20,"Blanchett is absolutely mesmerizing in this. I&#39;ve watched it once, and am giving myself at least one day before watching it again because it&#39;s still marinating in my mind. Had such a visceral reaction to it. It&#39;s brilliant on so many levels."

"11375","T√°r",2022-10-05,"I watched the film yesterday, and it was amazing! Cate is more than deserving of a third Oscar. She didn‚Äôt just play Lydia T√°r, she BECAME Lydia T√°r."
"11376","T√°r",2022-09-28,"Cate Blanchett is the most talented working actor today. She completely envelops every character she plays. Its astounding.  The psychological drama / thriller is my favorite genre and I can&#39;t wait to see this!"

Filmgoers, amateur and otherwise, will not be surprised by this. After all, she is a master supreme. Even so, while we were making the picture, the superhuman-skill and verisimilitude of Cate was something truly astounding to behold. She raised all boats. The privilege of collaborating with an artist of this caliber is something impossible to adequately describe. In every possible way this is Cate‚Äôs film.‚Äù</b>"

"11393","T√°r",2022-09-28,"Cate Blanchett is one of the finest actress of her generation, in the same level as other living actresses like Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Frances McDormand. She&#39;s a chameleon in her movies, when she acts, you really don&#39;t see Cate be like &quot;look at me I&#39;m an actress yeay&quot;, no, she literally became the person that she&#39;s playing, she dissapeared to the role. According to the director, this movie only works if Cate accepted the role, the role was meant for Cate and honestly seeing this trailer already, Cate is definitely gonna give another career best performance"
"11394","T√°r",2023-02-06,"Ferocious, core-wrenching, mind-altering musicality --- and that&#39;s just the acting. Essential examination of predatory power politics in the classical music world, and others. I didn&#39;t notice the movie&#39;s length and left knowing I had to re-vist the thorny argument on art vs artist (and am still in limbo). Like others, I&#39;m going to look up all of her movies."

"11398","T√°r",2023-02-25,"I just saw the film in the cinema. I cannot put to words how much I adore Cate Blanchett. She just has to win an Oscar for this, there is no other way. She&#39;s always fabulous, but she&#39;s outdone herself this time I swear"
"11399","T√°r",2023-04-26,"The only actor I can think of who gets to this level of absolutely positively becoming the character, and being extreeeemely selective choosing roles, is Daniel Day-Lewis.  To me, these two are in a league of their own"
"11400","T√°r",2023-04-14,"I saw ads for this and honestly thought it would be a basic film about some rich persons struggle in losing the limelight.<br><br>But watching it was so much more. It was fantastic. So many subtle details, such strong cinematic shots, way more psychological than expected.<br><br>I suffer with severe depression, and as someone who is a creative, this film sparked back my desire to create and learn again.<br><br>On very rare occasion do I have this - where a film, especially one with a grim outlook, will inspire me to creative and engage more in my life.<br><br>This film is phenomenal if you have an appreciation for visual and audio craft, interesting dialogue points and melancholy cinema.<br><br>I strongly recommend watching it with proper surround sound, a big screen - and paying close attention. There‚Äôs a lot of tie backs and connections worth looking out for"
"11401","T√°r",2023-06-11,"CB was already one of my favorite actors. I&#39;ve never seen anyone knock it out of the park like in this movie. It doesn&#39;t pander. The character is tragically flawed and she kills it. CB is one of, if not the most, skilled actors we&#39;ve seen."
"11402","T√°r",2022-11-11,"Easily the best film of the year. I didn‚Äôt want it to end."

"11404","T√°r",2022-09-28,"One of Cate Blanchett&#39;s most powerful acting skills is that she allows herself to be fully seen by the viewer. She has a profound ability to fully reveal herself within each of the diverse roles she plays, no holds barred."

So excited to see a TRULY QUALITY FILM, somewhat of a rarity at the theaters these days."
"11407","T√°r",2022-11-19,"Such a good movie. A once in a lifetime acting spectacle from Cate Blanchett"
"11408","T√°r",2023-07-23,"Michelle Yeoh could never reach this level of acting, still in awe of it"

"11411","T√°r",2023-04-23,"The best actress of our current generation."
"11412","T√°r",2022-10-02,"This movie is gonna be the next step in the saga of movies like Black Swan and Whiplash. I really can‚Äôt wait, these kind of movies are my favorite."
"11413","T√°r",2023-03-15,"I became a huge Cate Blanchett fan after seeing her in Blue Jasmine, so can&#39;t wait to see this."
"11414","T√°r",2022-11-22,"This movie is so relevant at so many levels.  the best movie I&#39;ve seen in the last five years"
"11415","T√°r",2023-03-13,"she was so deserving of the oscar win. How on earth did yeoh win over her?"
"11416","T√°r",2023-02-24,"Ms. Blanchett is outstanding, totally in her own magnificent class. And the story reminds me so very much of Maestro von Karajan, his genious and other much less known stories about him...."
"11417","T√°r",2022-11-07,"This film is so much better than the trailer makes it out to be!"
"11418","T√°r",2023-01-12,"So glad to see movies for adults are still relevant."
"11419","T√°r",2022-09-28,"I love how Focus Features is giving this movie a horror movie marketing"
"11420","T√°r",2023-01-06,"Decision to Leave is the best movie of the year. This is an alright movie with a great performance from Cate Blanchett."
"11421","T√°r",2022-09-28,"Todd Field + Cate Blanchett + lesbian romance + psychological thriller ?<br>I&#39;m in!"
"11422","T√°r",2022-10-24,"Saw this last night - it‚Äôs already becoming one of my favorite performances in film. Comparable to Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood, but with such stylish class"

"11424","T√°r",2023-08-09,"Wow. What a performance !  (by Cate). Outstanding acting."
"11425","T√°r",2022-09-28,"I am a simple man. I see Cate Blanchett, I click."
"11426","T√°r",2023-03-28,"I watched it 4 times. That movie is astonishing. As a big fan of ¬´¬†The King and the Mockingbird¬†¬ª, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice similarities and references to this movie. T√°r always talking about robots, the way her feet are filmed before the live record of Malher‚Äôs Symphony, and even the construction site scene when she gets out of her taxi. The King and the Mockingbird is about losing all power, after years of tyranny and domination. It all makes perfect sense."
"11427","T√°r",2022-11-07,"What an amazing movie! Cate Blanchett&#39;s performance is fantastic!"
"11428","T√°r",2023-01-29,"I am a simple man... I see Cate Blanchett and then Thumbs Up!"

"11430","T√°r",2022-09-28,"I saw this at the Telluride Film Festival. It was my favorite!!!"
"11431","T√°r",2022-11-01,"My mom is member of small chamber orchestra where she lives (playing violin). It&#39;s highly competitive field especially for women (just this year 2 of the members were laid off because of budget cutting). This film looks very interesting I hope it will tell the story about keeping your own identity versus dynamics in work. This line of work can really absorb you and destroy your personal life, I know that sadly from my experience."
"11432","T√°r",2023-01-09,"She is supremely gifted. We are lucky to witness such an expert at their craft."
"11433","T√°r",2023-02-24,"Cate deserves üëè  more and more Oscars she&#39;s great talent üëè"

"11435","T√°r",2022-09-30,"A comeback to cinema by Todd Field and what a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett. Masterclass. Indeed a 3rd Oscar for the legend."
"11436","T√°r",2023-02-01,"It&#39;s been a long time since I have paid to see a film twice in a week, but T√°r is something special.  Actually, I think I might go a third time."
"11437","T√°r",2022-10-10,"I hope I can see it soon! I was in band/orchestra in HS as well as seeing some actual orchestras. I&#39;ve been enjoying Nodame Contabile for over for 15+ years. I enjoy dramas that feature the orchestra not being just another character, accent, or theme, but being more. <br><br>Music drives our emotions in film, but to see it actually actively affect or reflect the character or situation. In a sense, it&#39;s a baring of the soul."
"11438","T√°r",2022-10-08,"For what I&#39;ve read from people who I really trust their taste in cinema, this is apparently a true gem. Amongst all the low quality &#39;films&#39; we are over exposed to."
"11439","T√°r",2023-07-27,"No one can pull off this role.  Best actress without a doubt!!!"
"11440","T√°r",2022-10-30,"Cate Blanchett&#39;s performance in Tar is incendiary. She deserves Best Actor Oscar for the role"
"11441","T√°r",2022-10-09,"One one the ten best of all time. All time"
"11442","T√°r",2022-11-20,"She is this eras Katharine Hepburn!! I watched it because of her. Absolutely brilliant, phenomenal, magnificent, a genius!! I am in awe of her !!"

"11445","T√°r",2023-01-30,"I regret trusting the opinions of mostly everyone here. I&#39;m not sure what Tar I saw, but it wasn&#39;t as incredible as everyone makes it. If you enjoy dialogue movies, this one is for you. If you expect a movie about live concerts and long musical scenes, you won&#39;t find it here. Also, be prepared to sit for three hours. I only stayed for the whole movie because I love every movie Cate plays in. Her facial expressions and movements are so rich, and true, and that alone makes it a good movie if you are a fan of hers."

"11452","The Lost King",2023-02-16,"I&#39;m searching everywhere for this movie. It is not on Amazon prime here in the USA or any other streaming service. I would really love to see this film as I&#39;m totally in love with the trailer. Sally Hawkins is amazing in any movie."

"11458","The Lost King",2023-02-10,"This trailer is very different from the first one - it seemed from that that a big part of the movie is what happens AFTER her discovery, and it&#39;s not as fanciful has this trailer suggests.  Still - can&#39;t wait."

I have yet to see a movie be given this level of dedication since. The costumes, the pacing, the coordination of the people, parades and action. And especially the speeches. I can&#39;t tell you what it was like to see these for the first time in the theater, before most knew what it really was. What it was like when movies lived up to the hype, and blew you away."

After all these years it&#39;s one film that still gives me chills, even though I&#39;ve seen it countless times after on VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray. Following the trilogy over three years, from 2001-2003, felt like a journey in itself, I will never forget the clash of feelings I felt when the credits first began to roll. Thank you Tolkien, and Peter Jackson, for making a timeless masterpiece."

It was phenomenal! I got back home around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5X-hFf6Bwo&amp;t=270"">4:30</a> and still got to go to school but It was worth it. After that It became a family tradition to go that late at night.<br>I will never forget being thrilled watching the helm&#39;s deep battle in theaters with all the fans clapping and laughing together, it was an epic experience, now is really hard to go to cinemas and experience the same thing with everyone. I will never forget the incredible experience of watching LOTR, I&#39;m glad I was mature enough to go to the cinemas and appreciate this movies. I will always be grateful to Tolkien and Peter Jackson.<br>I know the hobbit aren&#39;t as great as the LOTR, but the excitement of the fans in the theaters is whats makes me go each year, and this movies still give me a little taste of LOTR, so I will always welcome that ^^.<br>Now I hope Peter picks The Silmarillion, some of its chapters will become awesome movies!!"

"11652","Strange World",2022-12-02,"This looks more like a Dreamworks movie. I saw the poster of it at the theater, thinking it was for a movie coming out in 2023.  After watching the trailer it looks like something that would come out in early 2010&#39;s."
"11653","Strange World",2022-11-08,"The designs of some of the characters, especially the MC&#39;s, remind me of Hotel Transylvania. It&#39;s the eyes, vertical oval shape and how close together the eyes are."
"11654","Strange World",2022-09-21,"Glad to see Jake and Dennis take on more voice roles. They have the perfect voices for animation and comedy."
"11655","Strange World",2022-11-28,"48K likes, 43k dislikes. This trailer is doing so well."
"11656","Strange World",2022-12-03,"It&#39;s weird to think how hated Disney is now. What a shame."
"11657","Strange World",2022-12-06,"All this movie makes me wanna do is watch Treasure Planet. You know Disney, it&#39;d be nice if you did some cartoon animations once in a while. Dreamworks and Pixar styled movies are great I love them the 3D animations, but Disney I feel like honestly ur way more well known for cartoon styled animation. Seriously I feel like this movie would&#39;ve been so much better had it been cartoon drawn animation because it would&#39;ve looked more appealing overall!"
"11658","Strange World",2023-09-30,"I absolutely loves this film. Especially the world building is fantastic, best world building I have seen in years. I really cannot understand all the negative comments."
"11659","Strange World",2022-11-26,"Went woke and went broke this long weekend. Bombed hard. Who could have guessed."
"11660","Strange World",2022-09-21,"Anyone else notice how many movies are being put out right now? Seems like so many"
"11661","Strange World",2022-09-21,"like seriously there stories and animations are the best"
"11662","Strange World",2023-10-03,"Why people hate this movie so much? Its actually a very good movie"
"11663","Strange World",2022-12-11,"i swear disney forgot they made this movie"
"11664","Strange World",2022-09-21,"This looks like a hardcore father-son story."
"11665","Strange World",2022-09-26,"You know... looking at this trailer, I miss Disney&#39;s traditional animation. Just a little bit..."
"11666","Strange World",2022-09-22,"i feel like this movie has already come out like 10 times before but with different coats of paint"
"11667","Strange World",2022-11-30,"This world we&#39;re living in is a pretty strange world too :))))"
"11668","Strange World",2022-12-26,"A White father. A Black mother. A homosexual son and a three legged dog. Diversity."
"11669","Strange World",2023-03-17,"I finally understood why this trailer felt so weird. All of the dialogue in this trailer are dubbed over the original footage. If you look at the mouths none of the lines match up. Not sure why they barely chose to keep a single shot where the audio actually matched the scene."
"11670","Strange World",2022-12-14,"Kids gonna be growing up thinking this is the norm now, damn I&#39;m so lucky we had Toy Story and the Lion King - fook Disney!"
"11671","Strange World",2022-09-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKh2G73gCCs&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> <br>He is dead, he is straight up dead, there is no convincing me that he didn&#39;t die"
"11672","Strange World",2022-11-28,"It is funny how pixar can show a great trailer of elemental without showing nothing of the plot, meanwhile disney just literally spoils half the movie in their trailer"
"11673","Strange World",2023-07-04,"it&#39;s so underrated, it&#39;s such a good movie has a nice story what the heck is with people bashing this<br><br>anyways i love how this movie shows that 3 gens of the same lineage has its own similarities and differences, it&#39;s wholesome and heartwarming, i wanna say something that i love about the concept but it&#39;s def a spoiler but i love the place that they were travelling in specially when they learned about it"
"11674","Strange World",2022-11-29,"Thanks for revealing 70% of the movie, I don&#39;t need to pay a cinema ticket now :)"
"11675","Strange World",2022-12-04,"Seems like a movie you could watch once and then be okay with never seeing it again"
"11676","Strange World",2022-09-21,"Finally, a movie that isn&#39;t a live action remake"
"11677","Strange World",2022-12-04,"Love the part where Quasimodo changes the light bulb and cries out &quot;yippee yay yay Schweinebacke&quot; in deep bavarian german, while Frank the Tank empties one of the go&#39;ol Rich Piana 5%er piss jugs with a encouraging &quot;I&#39;m your father Thomas the Tank engine!&quot;<br>Seriously one of movies of time. I crieded."
"11678","Strange World",2022-10-25,"Some trailers have really bad ‚Äúdesync‚Äù were they clearly pulled the audio and the visuals from two separate scenes. But this one takes the cake. Almost everything doesn‚Äôt match up and it‚Äôs more than obvious. I don‚Äôt know why studios do it, but it just makes the product look cheaper for no apparent reason."
"11679","Strange World",2022-12-05,"Trailers that tell you literally the entire plot are tight!"
"11680","Strange World",2023-01-16,"People&#39;s complaints with the trailer revealing &quot;all major plot points and twists&quot; are not really valid because if you have watched the film, you see that there are bigger twists and lessons that are revealed. The messages of this film are quite solid, respecting the environment and not being selfish, and learning that you can love your family without everyone being the same are some of them which stood out to me and were not immediately evident from this trailer."
"11681","Strange World",2022-09-21,"Finally! A Jules Verne inspired adventure!"
"11682","Close",2022-09-18,"As someone who worked in child care for 9 plus years I have strong feeling what this movie may be about and I‚Äôm glad to see it. I think this movie will discuss and show us that age where young boys are soft and best of friends. It will then show the transition of when boy develop the idea of being distant and not being able to be emotionally open with one another. I can‚Äôt wait to see it. And even if I guess wrong the movie still looks good."
"11683","Close",2022-09-12,"I don‚Äôt know why, but I was so moved by the scene of them riding their bikes in different directions when they hit a fork in the road"
"11684","Close",2022-09-12,"Exactly my point! Girl friends can be seen holding hands and heads on necks. But society norms deem it ‚Äúgay‚Äù if two boys were to do it. Sometimes they‚Äôre really just that close. Interested to see this movie‚Äôs message."
"11685","Close",2022-09-18,"Before anyone argues that the conversation around this film must inevitably be lgbtq and the interpretation has to conclude queerness between these two characters, can we agree that it&#39;s ok to allow a story between two same-sex characters to be about heterosexual friendship? Homophobia is one topic in this film, but I think toxic masculinity and the inability to be affectionate with male friends without being labeled is the bigger topic."
"11686","Close",2022-12-04,"Watched this one 3 weeks ago in theaters.  It‚Äôs been years that a movie devistated me like this one did. Forgot how hard it was growing up as a kid. The acting, colors, music, ‚Ä¶ An absolute gem. When the end credits rolled, everyone just stayed seated to take a moment of the emotional impact. Still haunts me to this day to be honest."
"11687","Close",2022-09-07,"Oh boy this looks like a heartbreaker."
"11688","Close",2022-11-18,"A few weeks ago the doorbell rang and when I opened it, the young son of our next-door neighbor was  there with a male friend, shyly asking if they could retrieve their ball from our yard. They were holding hands, and I felt like crying to see their youthful innocence and simplicity. For sure they won&#39;t be holding hands much longer..."
"11689","Close",2022-09-16,"This is going to be very emotional. I&#39;m certain and aware of the fact that there&#39;s often stigma around male friendships. A24 guarantees the best quality films. They just never disappoint."
"11690","Close",2022-09-18,"This looks like a lovely and heartbreaking film.  I work around children and most little boys are sweet, open and excited to express themselves but are confronted by bullies, and the demand to be tough so early.  It is very sad and the older I get I recognize it.  Because I didn&#39;t have sons I think I just wasn&#39;t always aware of the challenges they face."
"11691","Close",2022-09-08,"Good to see A24 distributing more foreign-language films! That&#39;s been my main critique - hopefully more to come. There&#39;s a big wide world of great films from all over the world."
"11692","Close",2022-09-17,"the cinematography and the colors they chose look absolutely stunning, what a gorgeous trailer"
"11693","Close",2022-09-12,"Half the comments are ‚Äúthis is going to make me sob‚Äù and the other half are ‚Äúlook at these friends being friendly and only friends, friends only, no other discussion allowed this is definitely not a commentary on the complexity of young relationships and coming of age‚Äù and it‚Äôs an interesting combo"
"11694","Close",2022-10-25,"I won tickets to see this movie pre-release and wow‚Ä¶ I can sincerely recommend everyone to watch it. It is beyond beautiful, a simple story with perfect cinematography. You will feel every emotion the main character is feeling when watching, it‚Äôs a true masterpiece. <br><br>(prepare a VERY large box of tissues)"
"11695","Close",2022-09-07,"These films continue to be a substitute for the meaningful conversations that I can&#39;t have with society in general."
"11696","Close",2023-01-03,"I saw this movie just hours ago, and I‚Äôm still crying. So intense. So real. So hurtful."
"11697","Close",2022-11-11,"Very few movies made me feel and cry as much as Close did, by the talented Lukas Dohnt. Art helping us to remember those we forgot along the way, and treasure those memories. <br>Feel so close from those long gone today. Go watch it! Thank you A24."
"11698","Close",2023-01-22,"Kudos to the two young actors - Eden Dambrine and Gustav De Waele - for their exquisite, gut-wrenching performances! They each conveyed a tremendous amount of thought and emotion, often without saying a word. I watched a blissful, carefree bond get tainted and dissipate while hoping they are eventually reunited. No spoilers here, but see this film."
"11699","Close",2023-01-26,"When someone suddenly leave you or start treating you like suddenly you are zero to them... I know that pain üíî"
"11700","Close",2022-10-26,"The most beautiful film if ever watched."
"11701","Close",2022-09-07,"A24 already has the best year they‚Äôve ever had and it‚Äôs about to get even better between this, The Whale, and much more"
"11702","Close",2022-12-30,"How exactly this movie pictures childhood and how we act when we are kids is truly a masterpiece. I&#39;ve never felt so empty like I did after watching this movie."
"11703","Close",2022-09-21,"I think this looks incredible. I was just talking to my boyfriend about how men and boys should be able to form close friendships based in love without people automatically assuming it‚Äôs romantic or sexual love. NOTHING is wrong with sexual/romantic love between males at all, but it‚Äôs not fair to assume that all close relationships between boys must be inherently sexual because men are socialized not to be affectionate and warm."
"11704","Close",2022-09-23,"Just from the trailer I can see those two boys are incredible actors. It&#39;s in the small details."
"11705","Close",2022-09-12,"It&#39;s  giving  Barry Jenkins&#39; &quot;Moonlight&quot; vibes ...also an A24 production. Love it."
"11706","Close",2022-11-16,"This film is a masterpiece! It&#39;s not a film that you just &quot;watch&quot; but an experience where you feel every emotion. The cinematography is splendid."
"11707","Close",2022-09-20,"A24 films are like films, if you know what I mean. It&#39;s not like some mass produced blockbuster movies. There&#39;s a real message on every film they produce."
"11708","Close",2022-09-07,"Tracking shots with people or animals running in fields never gets old"
"11709","Close",2022-11-08,"watched this movie in my local small cinema; cried my eyes out, At least 4 times. Glad to see a Belgian movie doing so good internationally."
"11710","Close",2022-09-07,"this trailer was an out of body experience. so excited for this film"
"11711","Close",2022-09-17,"You guys aren&#39;t ready. I don&#39;t think I can even count the number of people crying around me when we were in the theatre."
"11712","Close",2022-11-28,"What a movie‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt remember that I feel soo strong emotional after watching this masterpiece‚Ä¶ I almost cry two times, amazing acting and roller coaster of emotions. Thank you"
"11713","Close",2022-11-17,"I&#39;ve watched it twice, and cried 4 times. It&#39;s so gooooddd!!! What I like about this movie is, it captures accurately how when we were kids, we don&#39;t know how to express our feelings, and that sometimes results in friendship going distant for no apparent reason which I&#39;ve personally experienced it myselfüò¢"
"11714","Close",2022-09-16,"I was so happy to see that it&#39;s gonna be a foreign language. I feel like American movies lack a certain...emotional quality because languages such as German/French have phrases that describe feelings that we do not. I&#39;ll never forget seeing my first Austrian film and I thought about it for months. It&#39;s nuts how many people skip movies because they don&#39;t wanna read the subtitles. I have a friend whose dyslexic and I used to read the subtitles to her in Asian movies because she liked them, but wasn&#39;t good at reading quickly. I loved how animated I used to get. I miss those days. You don&#39;t know the film experiences you&#39;re missing out on, just because of the language barrier. üñ§ as per usual, A24 is going to absolutely CRUSH this"
"11715","Close",2022-11-28,"The subject matter of this movie is personal for me, because I see myself and my first best friend in these characters, as Im sure many men will. We were, forgive me, close, from 1st Grade until 9th Grade. That was when sexuality began to pervade life due to the collective puberty we were all experiencing. One day, another kid asked us if we were gay, and everything spiraled downward from there. We gradually became distant and unresponsive with each other, and our beautiful connection, one that rendered us non-blood brothers, died. One of the great banes of society is the complete and utter emotional suppression and castration of boys becoming men."
"11716","Close",2022-09-07,"So excited for this film!!!!! Looks beautiful and almost ethereal"
"11717","Close",2023-01-01,"i just watched this movie and now i‚Äôm in so much pain. my first cry of 2023."
"11718","Close",2022-09-07,"A24 still on fire I see. Seems they understand the true depths of art and how to make us truly feel something"
"11719","Close",2022-10-17,"how on EARTH did they find two child actors to perform such complex and nuanced roles üò≠"
"11720","Close",2022-09-07,"Y‚Äôall rolling out movies left and right! This looks like it‚Äôs going to be a teary film"
"11721","Close",2022-09-16,"This trailer needs more views. It&#39;s so good and I want to watch the film."
"11722","Close",2022-12-17,"You guys didn&#39;t ready for this. <br>This movie is the BEST! You&#39;ll enjoy it every second. A lot of tears will come, so ready your tissues. Like, a lot of tissues."
"11723","Close",2022-09-16,"If it&#39;s anywhere near as good as Dhont&#39;s previous film Girl, then it&#39;s going to be remarkable. I CAN&#39;T WAIT."
"11724","Close",2023-01-19,"I just finished watching this movie... and I&#39;m still crying. ü•∫ This Is extremely beautifully made piece of something. I loved every single shot. Thanks for bringing it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.üòá"
"11725","Close",2022-12-10,"This is film is personal. You can already feel how intimate and authentic it is from this trailer ‚ù§‚Äçüî•Major &quot;it&quot; factor"
"11726","Close",2022-09-07,"Literally have chills from this, I cannot wait!"
"11727","Close",2022-09-20,"The music gives &quot;Moonlight&quot; vibes while the scenes give vibes from &quot;Call me by your name&quot; but for children. Seems a great watch, look forward"
"11728","Close",2022-12-04,"Perfect cinematic captures. Truly emotionally rich"
"11729","Close",2022-12-11,"I think this was the best movie I saw this year."
"11730","Emily",2022-08-12,"I remember this popular guy in my English class in high school saying he hated reading Wuthering Heights because it was just some dumb romance for girls and I&#39;ll never forget the (male) teacher going on this whole spiel about Bronte&#39;s genius and that this kid had completely missed one of the best revenge stories ever written because he was too busy being sexist to bother paying attention. It was the first time I saw a man openly and unapologetically defend a woman&#39;s art. I&#39;m in my forties now and I still remember that. He was one of the coolest teachers I ever had."
"11731","Emily",2022-08-11,"the way emma mackey knows how to portray every character she plays perfectly. she just gets into the atmosphere and tries her best to perform and she manages to do that. one of the reasons she is one of my favourite actresses."
"11732","Emily",2022-08-11,"Emma Mackey must be one of the most talented actress of her generation. I can&#39;t wait to watch her as Emily"
"11733","Emily",2022-08-12,"I can&#39;t wait to see all the Bront√´ sisters on screen, especially Emily. All three sisters were incredible novelists, and it&#39;s such a shame that society at the time condemned women writing stories, instead expecting them to be housewives and mothers. Like many female writers at the time, they had their works published under male names so they wouldn&#39;t have scandal and controversy at their doorstep. It&#39;s very tragic that all three sisters died young; I felt that Emily&#39;s death was the worst of all. I wish they lived long enough to see their works become literary masterpieces."
"11734","Emily",2022-08-11,"i actually and genuinly believe that Emma Mackey is perfect for this role, rare are the times where i feel such strong connexion with the way a character (especially a historical figure!) is portrayed in movies, i&#39;m so excited to watch this"
"11735","Emily",2022-08-11,"I deeply hope this is good and worthy of Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights is one of the most gripping books I have ever read."
"11736","Emily",2022-08-13,"Every loner and introvert when reading about Emily cannot help but say &quot; I understand exactly why she thought/ did that&quot; what a total one off she was.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"11737","Emily",2022-08-12,"Actually very sad to know that all these great creators had such a difficult life, because of their unique thoughts. And only after they have passed away, are appreciated and known as legends"
"11738","Emily",2022-08-13,"The score went absolutely PERFECT with the cinematography in this trailer. Acting looks sublime, the way she can fit perfectly into ANY role she plays is just phenomenal. Stunning video editing and casting direction. The overhead shots look amazing and vivid."
"11739","Emily",2022-08-13,"The scene of them shouting &#39;freedom in thought&#39; really reminds me of that Anne with an E scene with Anne and Cole standing at the edge of a cliff shouting &#39;come to me muse!&#39; Or that one scene from The Book Thief where Liesel and Rudy are standing at a lake in the middle of the woods shouting &#39;I hate Hitler!&#39;<br>These scenes are gold! üòç And this looks so thrilling and amazing! üß°"
"11740","Emily",2022-08-13,"&quot;Everyone&#39;s strange if you look at them long enough!&quot;<br>Couldn&#39;t have been said better. This sentence just hits different."
"11741","Emily",2022-08-12,"&quot;Everyone&#39;s strange if you look at them long enough&quot; must be my fav lines out of the entire trailer."
"11742","Emily",2022-08-11,"My son was on this shoot..Emma was amazing with the kids!"
"11743","Emily",2022-08-13,"The feeling of being a Misfit is definitely  a creative journey , Im glad she never gave up otherwise we wouldn&#39;t of had her amazing stories"
"11744","Emily",2022-08-12,"Hmmm I don‚Äôt know about this film. It doesn‚Äôt seem very true to many of the things I‚Äôve read about Emily Bront√´. I think the relationship between the three sisters (and their father and Branwell) is fascinating enough without making it a romance (and as far as we know, Emily didn‚Äôt HAVE any romances!)"
"11745","Emily",2022-08-13,"I always get nervous when I see biopics about authors, especially female ones. So often these kinds of movies attribute all the authors&#39; fantastic ideas to some guy that did them wrong or some boy who died tragically, etc. rather than just acknowledging that a woman can write for the sake of their love of writing and their own imagination. Hope this one does the Brontes justice!"
"11746","Emily",2022-08-14,"Finally a period piece that seems to have costumes and art direction that feels appropriate and not too modernized for today&#39;s audiences.  And the trailer peaks my curiosity."
"11747","Emily",2022-08-14,"Oh yes. Because a woman cannot be interested in art for art&#39;s sake. A woman cannot be the greatest female novelist in history and totally uninterested in romance and marriage at the same time. Oh no, there always has to be a man or a romantic attachment in the equation. Very little is known of Emily Bront√´&#39;s inner life because most of it happened inside her head and not in public. She did&#39;nt have close friends she corresponded with, like Charlotte. She left some journal entries, her poetry, her Gondal series and one of the best, most powerful novels ever written.  What we know of her, we know through the eyes of Charlotte Bront√´: &quot;Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone.&quot; I hate this fictionalization of real life artists. Genius cannot be pinned down like a butterfly."
"11748","Emily",2022-08-12,"Why do I get the feeling from this that they&#39;re making her out to be a genius and a free spirit by putting down her brilliant sisters? Why do they think there can there only be one &quot;special one&quot;?"
"11749","Emily",2022-08-12,"I hate this already. Emily Bront√´ was a genius partly because she had literally no real life experience to inspire even one word of Wuthering Heights - it was pure intellect and imagination. And if we go down that route of shaping WH as some kind of tragic romance again I‚Äôll cry. It just isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs about nature v nurture, the trauma and cycle of abuse, the tension between the natural state of childhood with its goodness and innocence but also its cruelty and selfishness and the falsity but more civilised conformity to the social norms of adulthood and I could go on and on‚Ä¶ If she had been a man we wouldn‚Äôt keep framing it as a love story. when she was thought to be a man, people didn‚Äôt. They were disturbed by it but also recognised it as a work of massive psychological insight. The more interesting story to me is not of a totally imagined passion to make this woman more understandable and relatable and that will make her spin in her grave, but how did someone so anti-social, so completely disengaged with everything and everyone outside of her home, come up with all of that‚Ä¶?"
"11750","Emily",2022-08-11,"Can&#39;t wait to see her portray this character. Looks enchanting!"
"11751","Emily",2022-10-17,"Just watched this movie. Beautifully acted but be aware it is ‚Äúloosely based on Emily‚Äôs life‚Äù so avoid if you‚Äôre going to say this, that or the other part of her story is incorrect. It‚Äôs a tale of literature, love and revenge, well acted and and very enjoyable."
"11752","Emily",2022-08-11,"i love emma mackey, she&#39;s the perfect choice to play emily"
"11753","Emily",2022-08-11,"So I&#39;m under the impression that Emily Bronte was an introverted homebody that had a lot of social anxiety but loved her family, kinda like Beth in Little Women, even died young too, I really wonder how this movie os gonna portray this literary figure"
"11754","Emily",2022-08-16,"For anyone interested in this, and who hasn‚Äôt seen To Walk Invisible, I recommend that as a good starting point. Great film about the Bront√´, came out a few years ago. Feels super real. Moving. Powerful. It‚Äôs on Prime."
"11755","Emily",2022-08-12,"Look, I love Emma Mackey, but we already have the perfect Bronte Sisters biopic with Sally Wainwright&#39;s &#39;To Walk Invisible&#39;, and Chloe Pirrie&#39;s performance as Emily in that is just incredible."
"11756","Emily",2022-08-11,"Such an amazing cast! Can‚Äôt wait to see Anne Bront√´ on screen üß°"
"11757","Emily",2022-08-11,"<b>Emily imagines the transformative, exhilarating, and uplifting journey to womanhood of a rebel and a misfit, one of the world&#39;s most famous, enigmatic, and provocative writers who died too soon at the age of 30!!</b>"
"11758","Emily",2022-08-12,"It looks good, the acting is good but I hate it and Emily would have hated it even more. She hated people sticking her nose into her life and she would hate it even more than instead of showing her closest connection: WITH ANNE, they are focusing on totally made-up romance and kisses that never happened. It is like you cannot make a movie about a strong and talented writer who is female and had no romantic life and apparently zero interest in it."
"11759","Emily",2022-08-30,"As an English Literature student, I had goosebumps. A BBC Classics vibe. Emma Mackey is the actress of the next-gen. Keep it up!"
"11760","Emily",2022-08-13,"Looks great! I really enjoyed the BBC series &quot;TO WALK INVISIBLE&quot; a few years ago. It chronicles the entire Bronte family and shows the struggles of motivations of each without conjecturing too far into the realm of fiction. Still, this one looks great! It would be nice to see a different film (with the same cast) for each of the three Bronte sisters."
"11761","Emily",2022-11-18,"I love this film, I watched it twice. Cried both times, there is something so relatable to me about how Emily is portrayed in this film. Yes I understand it‚Äôs not based on facts, it‚Äôs embellished a little, but that‚Äôs ok with me. It‚Äôs interesting to think of these what if‚Äôs sometimes. I relate to how she‚Äôs the black sheep in the family, the artist in her, the great love that changed in a blink. It‚Äôs just perfection to me."
"11762","Emily",2022-08-11,"Beautiful üòç Emma Mackey is so talented, and nailed the role of Jacky, in Death of the Nile. Can‚Äôt wait to see this."
"11763","Emily",2022-08-15,"I‚Äôm glad Emma is getting more roles. This looks great."
"11764","Emily",2022-08-12,"Looks like there is now a real life Heathcliff and a real life Linton...do we just not trust Emily to be able to create these characters from her IMAGINATION without needing real-life counterparts??"
"11765","Emily",2022-08-12,"Emily &amp; Anne Bronte‚Äôs works are astonishing - you wonder how much imagination they had, to create what they did (Anne was a bit more isolated than her sisters, who went to school &amp; spent time as governesses- so in some ways, that adds to the mystery...)"
"11766","Emily",2022-08-15,"misfit, unconventional, can‚Äôt describe how emma seems perfect for this role. it‚Äôs all in her face, in the way she moves her eyes. can‚Äôt wait to watch this !!"
"11767","Emily",2022-08-13,"There were 2 older sisters, Elizabeth,  and Maria,  both died in childhood,  Elizabeth  would  read the daily paper  to her father at the age of  4 , the whole family,  were touched with genus  , thank god , even if they had to publish  under  a male name ,they did ,and in my view  Emily gave the world a,MASTERPIECE  THANK  YOU EMILY üòä üôè üíô"
"11768","Emily",2022-08-12,"This looks like the filmmakers have forced Emily Bront√´ into the Becoming Jane movie mould. I‚Äôve never heard of Emily having any romantic relationships. That‚Äôs not to say it never happened, but if this is saying she only could have written such a brilliant love story based off her own relationships, ugggh."
"11769","Emily",2022-08-11,"My favourite author portrayed by one of my favourite actors! Absolutely brilliant!"
"11770","Emily",2022-08-11,"WOW, cannot wait to see it! Wuthering Heights is a genious novel!"
"11771","Emily",2022-08-14,"Unpopular opinion I know but I don‚Äôt like the look of this! Having read actual biographies about Emily Bronte and the Bronte family as well as studying the novels this for me is not Emily Bronte. Why do people think that she must have had some form of love life to be able to write Wuthering Heights not that she was a literary genius who had a beautiful way with words. She was a strong women with ideas ahead of her time with a powerful and beautiful imagination. She loved her family and Haworth. Yes she did know William but it‚Äôs Anne that we think liked him, especially if you read Agnes Grey! Sorry but this is not Bronte 4 me. Also why is her hair in that style?"
"11772","Emily",2022-08-11,"Emma Mackey is everywhere, and I&#39;m loving it!!!"
"11773","Emily",2022-12-04,"I&#39;m so happy for Emma that she got this role. Just watched it and it was excactly what I hoped it would be. I didn&#39;t cry but got close. Emma and Oliver are amazing."
"11774","Emily",2022-08-13,"I&#39;m interested in watching this movie because the trailer already shows how people have always misunderstood Wuthering Heights in various ways.  People expect something from the book, but either freak out or are delighted when it pulls the rug out from under them.  Emily, you&#39;re still amazing after all these years, and I&#39;m so glad you allowed this book to be published!"
"11775","Emily",2022-08-12,"As a literary student, this types of movies does pinch a vein, hope it will be good. And love Emma Mackey."
"11776","Emily",2022-08-12,"Meanwhile, I&#39;m sitting here waiting for my girl Anne Bronte to get some recognition and respect"
"11777","Emily",2022-09-12,"If only Emily Bronte had lived longer, what she could have written. Wuthering Heights is a true masterpiece."
"11778","Emily",2022-08-12,"I&#39;m really excited to see this. I think the casting of Emma as Emily is brilliant"
"11779","Emily",2022-08-11,"so excited to see fionn whitehead on screen again ü§©"
"11780","Emily",2022-11-04,"This movie is a worthy homage for one of the world&#39;s greatest novels. Highly recommended. 10/10"
"11781","Emily",2022-08-18,"It feels really bizarre to portray someone who has two incredible authors as her sisters as this misunderstood literary rebel. Like, all three sisters wrote classic novels. It is not like Emily was completely alone."
"11782","Emily",2022-08-15,"I&#39;m so glad that they finally made a movie about my favourite writer Emily Bronte."
"11783","Emily",2022-11-17,"Just watched this and oh man this movie was something. Emma Mackey is absolutely perfect in this film and her acting is superb. I didn&#39;t see any trailers for this and just went in completely blind and I&#39;m glad I did. This was such a nice surprise and more people need to see this movie."
"11784","Emily",2022-08-12,"Moody trailer. Hope they do justice to portraying the close relationship between the sisters, and treat with empathy the storyline involving Branwell. Really hope that the romantic subplot doesn&#39;t derail the film but is tastefully imagined...<br><br>The Brontes, and their life stories, are each so fascinating. Their works, treasures. Please let this be a good film..."
"11785","Emily",2022-08-13,"Finally another film of this era with the correct hairstyles, dresses and finally bonnets, watch and learn little women and your lack of historical accuracies"
"11786","Emily",2022-11-27,"Give her an Oscar already. She is everywhere."
"11787","Emily",2022-08-16,"Magical. Emily, like Jane Austen never wed, dying of tuberculosis too soon. Both her sisters wrote of course but Wuthering Heights firmly planted her family flag in English Literature."
"11788","Emily",2022-12-07,"I read a book many years ago, I cannot remember the title, but I do remember the page number. It was 26. it was a sequel to Withering heights. it explained that when Heathcliffe found her in a grave, he tried to dig her out because her hand raised up from the soil."
"11789","Emily",2022-11-16,"I just finished this movie.. and OH MY GOD! One of the most beautiful movie I&#39;ve ever seen."
"11790","Emily",2022-08-15,"Emma Mackey has range. I hope her career will take off like she deserves. I also would like to see this movie."
"11791","Emily",2022-08-11,"Literally cannot wait for this! It looks amazing and really excited to see Amelia Gething in her first big screen role!"
"11792","Emily",2022-08-11,"I love Emily Bront√´ and Wuthering Heights since I was 12!!! In a world fawning over Austen and light-hearted romance books, it&#39;s so hard to get some spotlight for us sad, passionate girls üò≠üñ§ So thank you so much for giving us Bront√´ fans this gift, Warner Bros.!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"11793","Emily",2022-08-14,"I pray they don&#39;t sanitise Emily Bront√´ through a fictional romance. Emily Bront√´ was a loner, shy and eccentric. <br>The trailer does seem to stay true to her persona."
"11794","Emily",2022-10-12,"Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest books ever written.   Hope the film does justice to Emily Bronte and her sisters!!"
"11795","Emily",2022-08-11,"I thought this was about Emily Dickinson but this was a pleasant surprise as well."
"11796","Emily",2022-08-13,"Not sure about this, seems like from this short trailer that they are making Emily into someone she wasn&#39;t..and putting down her sisters when all 3 were incredibly talented."
"11797","Emily",2022-08-11,"I enjoy that everyone is wearing a bonnet."
"11798","Emily",2022-08-16,"The sisters all wrote together and all supported one another&#39;s stories. Why are they trying to portray Emily as the black sheep of the family? I hate that they&#39;ve fictionalised such an incredible woman just to tell another fictional story of another ahead-of-her-time rebel in a love triangle."
"11799","Emily",2022-08-11,"i wish they&#39;d have made the film more about all 3 bronte sisters ( their friendship, rivalry etc)"
"11800","Emily",2022-08-12,"I don‚Äôt like the look of this.. it looks like they‚Äôre dragging down 2 women to push a third up on a pedestal and I am SO sick of Hollywood doing this to create a ‚Äústrong female character.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to drag other women down to shine. And quite frankly, all 3 Bront√´ sisters were exceptional  writers and women, as shown in the (considerably more historically accurate, judging from this trailer) TV movie To Walk Invisible. <br>If we HAVE to have a film about a single Bront√´ sister, I‚Äôd rather have one about Anne, since she‚Äôs often the forgotten sister. But I don‚Äôt see why, since all 3 sisters would be in any film anyway, there‚Äôs a need for a film about a single sister.. let all 3 Bront√´s shine!"
"11801","Emily",2022-10-07,"Who knew the Bronte sisters were all such stunning beauties. Thanks for opening my eyes Hollywood."
"11802","Emily",2022-08-11,"I love such movies. They are such a breath of fresh air from the comic book nonsense Hollywood has been filled with."
"11803","Emily",2022-08-21,"I&#39;m so glad Emma Mackey is doing well!! Can&#39;t wait to see it"
"11804","Emily",2022-08-12,"Are we supposed to forget that Emily had two equally as talented/tortured sisters? Like Emily was the only one?"
"11805","Emily",2022-08-14,"Whoa.<br>The visuals. They really take you back there.<br>Most impressive."
"11806","Emily",2022-08-12,"&quot;Everyone is strange, if you look at them for long enough&quot; What a line."
"11807","Emily",2022-08-11,"I&#39;m pretty sure they all knew they could write. Since they had been doing it since they were children. The Brontes&#39; juvenilia is well known."
"11808","Emily",2022-08-17,"Amazing!! Thank God it wasn&#39;t produced by Netflix."
"11809","Emily",2022-08-11,"So the director makes up a story that Emily has an affair? Why? Why not tell the truth about Emily,  her strengths, her weaknesses not some BS about falling for a curate. I guess WB leant on the writers to make the movie commercial and they needed a love story to agree to finance it. What a shame this is how Hollywood works."
"11810","Emily",2022-09-02,"Ms Bronte was an imaginative and disciplined literary genius despite her austere surroundings."
"11811","Emily",2022-08-12,"My favourite person ever ‚ù§Ô∏è nobody was or is as clever as Emily . Wuthering heights is one of the best books ever written in terms of technique and emotion."
"11812","Emily",2022-08-18,"I knew this was about Emily Bront√´ before I knew this was about Emily Bront√´. I&#39;m looking forward to this :)"
"11813","Emily",2022-08-11,"NGL I thought this was gonna be another Emily Dickinson adaptation so when I saw it was instead Emma Mackey playing Emily Bronte I was over the moon!!! Fionn Whitehead is also the best... loved him since Dunkirk!"
"11814","Emily",2022-08-20,"I love Wuthering Heights so much and if anyone deserves a biopic it&#39;s Emily Bront√´. I don&#39;t know much about Emily but I hope it&#39;s going to be as accurate as possible. I did read a lot of it is based in rumors too like the affair, which I&#39;m not sure if I like...but I think Emma will do a great job portraying her based on just what I&#39;ve heard about Emily and her personality. The trailer looks so good!<br>I hope they play Kate Bush&#39;s song Wuthering Heights at the end, it&#39;s my favorite of all time and it would be such a missed opportunity not to play it."
"11815","Emily",2022-09-23,"This is something new.. first time i see a movie that will focus on the life of the bronte sisters. I&#39;ll totally watch it"
"11816","Emily",2022-08-11,"I love Emma Mackey sooo much, I will watch this movie for sure"
"11817","Emily",2022-08-12,"I love the Bront√´ sisters. So excited for this! ‚ù§"
"11818","Emily",2022-08-13,"The series &quot;Dickinson&quot;, story of the great poet Emily Dickinson was a masterpiece portrayed by Hailee Steinfeld and now this the story of Emily Bront√´     üòçüòçüòçüòç‚ù§‚ù§üíñüíñüåπüåπ Super Excited, Lots of Love."
"11819","Emily",2022-08-12,"This looks incredible! Also keen to see how Charlotte Bront√´ is portrayed."
"11820","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-26,"Wow!! They actually got a Japanese actor to play a Japanese character in a Hollywood movie??!! That hasn&#39;t happen before!! Hopefully there will be more true to characters representations in Hollywood movies in the Future!! This looks so dope I can&#39;t wait to see it.. The Japanese actor is slaying it, I think I saw him in Rorounin Kenshin live action.."
"11821","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-26,"As a long time Saint Seiya fan, I just hope they don&#39;t change the plot.  The story itself is a masterpiece already, no need to make up anything new"
"11822","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"Just hope they make it like Rurouni Kenshin was made... that was a masterpiece. Be faithful to the lore and it&#39;s golden."
"11823","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-28,"So so happy Mackenyu is gaining recognition! He deserves it allüíï"
"11824","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-24,"This actually looks better than expected"
"11825","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-28,"Mackenyu is such a great actor! So happy to see him lead this project! This is gonna be a good one!"
"11826","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS MOVIE BEING MADE?????? I was a huge fan of the anime as a kid. I‚Äôm so hyped for this!"
"11827","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-04-17,"saw &quot;among us&quot; in the theater and busted out laughing with my friends"
"11828","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-31,"As somebody who barely remembers the Original anime yet still holds a special place for me, I&#39;m actually excited to see it. I really do hope they can pull this off."
"11829","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-30,"From what I&#39;ve read about the plot of the movie, Seiya is supposed to be searching for his missing sister which is pretty accurate with the original story. In the classic anime, Mitsumasa Kido tells him to go to Greece and come back with the Pegasus cloth in order for him to find his sister. Looks like this movie might lead up to the battle at Sanctuary. If they do a good enough job, the second movie could be the Poseidon saga and the third movie could be the Hades saga. But that&#39;s being extremely hopeful that they get this first movie right.<br><br>Edit: According to the most recent article I came across about this movie, it&#39;s supposed to be the 1st of 6 movies. But they&#39;ll be based on the Netflix adaptation of Saint Seiya. Soooo we&#39;ll have to wait until the movie comes out to see what direction they plan on going in. Also, Kurumada says he enjoyed the movie and thinks the fans worldwide will also enjoy it."
"11830","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-27,"I&#39;m not completely sold on the armor (which is a missed opportunity because the potential to translate the look into live action was *huge*) but honestly this looks really great otherwise! I&#39;m super excited to see it. Can&#39;t wait!"
"11831","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-24,"Nice Seiya looks very cool, Athena seems pretty and Sean Bean makes it even more dramatic! Great action as well! Knights of the Zodiac!"
"11832","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-28,"Oooh, Arata Mackenyu as Pegasus Seiya!! The trailor seems great and the cast is just blowing. Cant&#39;t wait!"
"11833","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-26,"This was one of my favorite animes growing up!  LOVED Saint Seiya and I&#39;ve gotta go see this AND take my daughter with me!"
"11834","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-29,"Love Mackenyu and love Sean Bean. Never would have expected to see them acting together, but now I absolutely have to see this. ü§©"
"11835","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"I really hope the full film is as good as the trailer. I was a fan of the original anime Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac as soon as I was able to see it here in the US (yes, I know it was a Japanese manga first). I can&#39;t expect it to be exactly like the series, but I hope they pay decent homage to it."
"11836","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-29,"Omg, Mckenyu, congratulations, finally a movie with you as the lead role. I am so happy for you, I will definitely watch it to support you ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"

"11841","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-04-03,"I&#39;ll admit, this actually looks REALLY good, and due to the fact that Athena&#39;s guardians are from all over the globe, Saint Seiya is a good choice for this type of treatment."
"11842","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-26,"I just hope the story is as good as the fight scenes. Because if that happenes, then hope for having great anime adaptations could be restored."
"11843","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"When i was a senior high school pupil, i watched Saint Seiya Anime Series on TV...üëèüëèüòçüòçnow, there&#39;s the live action version, can&#39;t wait to watch it...üëçüëçüòçüòç Saori is beautiful... and all the Knights of the Zodiacs are charming... üëèüëèüíñüíñ‚ú®‚ú®"

"11845","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"If you compare this to the first trailer they released you can tell they made a few improvements and I&#39;m glad they did. This looks fantastic already!"
"11846","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"Although I am not too familiar with Saint Seiya..I have seen how the action scenes and previs work for this movie at comic con and lets just say..Andy Cheng is an incredible action director (part of the jackie chan stunt team) and they definitely have the visual aesthetics down for how anime fight scenes work..Also the director himself started out as animator that made shortfilms who worked on The Witcher games cgi scenes as well as executively producing The Witcher series...definitely has a knack for adapations..hopefully it translates well for his first feature length movie....So Im hoping this movie has everything fans and newcomers can enjoy..and hey, if it gets people interested in watching more Saint Seiya...thats a win for me"
"11847","Knights of the Zodiac",2023-03-25,"37 years and i&#39;v been waiting for this moment ..only hoping this leads to more versions of  saint seiya live actions movies"

If a sequel comes with all five of them, I&#39;m hopping for the Perseus and Libra Cloth, with the Benetnasch Eta Robe, Mermaid and Scylla Scale. Those were all my favorites."

"11896","Showing Up",2022-12-15,"One of my favs at the last Cannes Film Festival. Saw it just after the award ceremony and it was such a nice, calm and relaxing piece of film. Yout being projected into the life of a woman in it&#39;s thirty, who live as an artist. And then Reichardt follows a thread of ironic, touching, meditating sequences about life going on on screen. By little touches, she show us all kinds of feelings, thoughts and situations. And you just happen to carry on with it... Truly magic on film"

"11899","Showing Up",2022-12-15,"Michelle Williams is one of the best actress of her generation. She&#39;s a chameleon in many of her movies. She can really dissapeared into a role, as much as she&#39;s extremely invested in her character.

"11981","Inside",2022-11-22,"Willem Dafoe certainly knows how to portray every single one of his onscreen characters with gripping and escalating tension. Seems like there&#39;s no end to his acting. He just nails it without much difficulty on his part."

"11987","Inside",2022-12-20,"I pray this man wins an Oscar before he&#39;s too old. Hollywood needs to give him his roses while he&#39;s still here. He was robbed for an Oscar with At Eternity&#39;s Gate."

"11989","Inside",2022-11-23,"I really hope he has the best support from the people around him during these roles. I can just imagine the mental scaring from the process of acting this way especially coming from The Lighthouse. We love you Dafoe."

"12005","Inside",2022-11-19,"I love how this trailer is put together so I thought I&#39;d try to take a crack at what this might possibly about:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=8"">0:08</a> Here we get the setting which is this particular building in the center of the screen.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> The radio audio is to either be the outside police trying to get into the locked building to capture the intruder OR it&#39;s the earpiece audio the intruder (the main character) is receiving for instructions for this art theft heist probably additionally symbolizing communication between the outside world.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=42"">0:42</a> All the resources start to cease working which may also symbolize the feeling of desperation, panic, and crisis someone/something would feel when they&#39;re in isolation and/or danger.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=67"">1:07</a> Him destroying the priceless art pieces depict the drastic change in priority, needs over wants, when in a life or death situation<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=73"">1:13</a> Him throwing an object at the window only for it to turn into a bird foreshadows the extreme measures one would go through just to escape a trapped in situation only to constantly keep proving the possibility of failure is unavoidable.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=81"">1:21</a> The fish sorta represents as himself in a way because fish are living in their same tank their whole lives just like how he&#39;s locked in for who knows how long but unlike him the fish gets &quot;saved&quot; and &quot;put out of misery&quot; because he kills it from it&#39;s &quot;suffering&quot; as he also benefits by having raw food which temporarily &quot;saves&quot; him until he gets worse and quite possibly dies.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=86"">1:26</a> Here he talks to the pigeon saying &quot;nobody here but us pigeons&quot; which is another way of saying &quot;nobody&#39;s here but us&quot; because to him he relates to the pigeons because he believes they and him are the same for both being &quot;unimportant&quot; to everybody else.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=92"">1:32</a> He &quot;sets free&quot; the taped guy in the picture as if it was himself.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> He draws a pigeon opening it&#39;s third eye as if him and the pigeons have a spiritual bond by mind.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> He then spits water specifically at the third eye to show how they&#39;re both crying on the inside.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> This is definitely a nod to Willem Dafoe&#39;s iconic Green Goblin character as they coincidentally both have a thing for going insane :)<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=125"">2:05</a> and finally this last line where he says &quot;..art is for keeps&quot; is what really interests me as this could possibly be foreshadowing that the owner who owns all those art pieces is purposely keeping the guy trapped for longer than needed so he can get the guy crazy enough to start making &quot;art&quot; because insane or mentally ill people tend to create the most unique abstract art. (Like that pigeon drawing he made on the wall)<br>That&#39;s just my thoughts tho even though I&#39;ve never been to film making classes I for some reason still have an symbolic sense of understanding"
