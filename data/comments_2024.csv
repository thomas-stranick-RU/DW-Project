Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,I like the detail that envy is small because it makes you feel small and embarrassment is big because you feel like you&#39;re super noticable
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I love how Riley&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t have those extra emotions, meaning she grew out of them and she&#39;s comfortable showing her basic emotions without overthinking stuff."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,I hope that Brazilian helicopter pilot from Riley‚Äôs mom‚Äôs flashback makes an in person cameo in this one.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"‚ÄúRiley‚Äôs life requires more sophisticated emotions than all of you,‚Äù says Anxiety speaking to Joy. That was a crazy bar if I ever heard one. I feel growing up made it harder to just be joyous/happy with nothing else."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,I love how Anxiety‚Äôs bags can be interpreted literally as ‚ÄúEmotional Baggage‚Äù.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I love how the older emotions are just, not, used to being &quot;older.&quot; The newer ones react more throughout their choices. &quot;Riley&#39;s life needs more sophisticated emotions then all of you,&quot; is just perfect"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"This is the perfect representation of a teen going through puberty. the fact that their emotions are all over the place (literally) as well as their emotions being bottled up, causing them to feel more anxiety, and depression, rather than their usual self. puberty sucks, and it&#39;s fun seeing it turned into a physical representation.<br><br>Edit: for people who are saying &quot;thanks for stating the obvious&quot; i KNOW i am stating the obvious, i am just pointing out my respect for it. calm down."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Anxiety suppressing the other emotions is genius. This looks incredible.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Anxiety saying that her job is to &quot;plan for the future&quot; is PERFECT. Constantly imagining future situations at the expense of present reality. Chef&#39;s kiss.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I love that they used the ‚Äúbottle up‚Äù scene literally and metaphorically. That‚Äôs pretty brilliant considering that whenever we feel anxious, envy, or embarrassment we do bottle up our other emotions sometimes.<br><br>We grew up with Inside Out as kids, now we‚Äôre growing up with Inside Out 2 when we‚Äôre older."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just bottle us up!‚Äù<br>Well I know what happened to my main 5 emotions in high school
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,Anxiety taking control of everything is the most accurate thing ever
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"You can see that Anxiety is the villain not because she is bad, but because she somehow wanted the best for Riley and did what she did with her main emotions. Perhaps just as Joy realized that she needed to give space to all the emotions in the first film, Anxiety learns something similar in this one, that there are no more sophisticated emotions and that without the main ones, she and the other 3 are completely useless."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Glad that the other emotions: Fear, Anger, Disgust get to join in adventuring around Riley&#39;s mind now"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"I think one of the coolest part about this film being released almost 10 years after the first film, is that the children that grew up seeing this movie are likely going through what Riley is in this film.<br>Puberty.<br>Several therapists have attested to how Inside Out helped young children understand and process their emotions, and now those children are growing up and developing feelings they have even less understanding of. My parents kind of glossed over having any of these discussions and didn&#39;t address them until they became problematic, so I hope adults and even therapists see this movie to help their young pre-teens/teens navigate the misery of puberty."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,&quot;That is the preview of the next 10 years.&quot;<br>That is the best line in this whole movie.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"‚ÄúYou cant just bottle us up!‚Äù<br>That is such a great pun, and the fact that it will probably be a MAJOR plot point makes it even funnier"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,&quot; You cant just bottle us up!&quot;<br>Well good to know Joy still has her development from the first movie XD.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=45"">0:45</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> I feel like Envy and Disgust will have a Big Sister/ Little Sister relationship because they both look similar and seeing Disgust hold Envy is just too adorable."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,Seeing Envy being personified as a teeny tiny cutesy adorable emotion makes me think that her thing is that she transforms into BIG BAD GREEN-EYED MONSTER WITH SCARY TEETH AND FANGS AND AN ATTITUDE when she hits her breaking point.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment&#39;s designs are really interesting. Envy is a child, Ennui as an emo, and Embarrassment is a big guy that shy."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I love how you can tell Riley through her design that she still has her happy core, but that she&#39;s clearly growing up, too"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,i love how the bottling up emotions metaphor is as literal as it could possibly get
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,"&quot;Welp, that&#39;s a preview of the next 10 years!&quot;<br>Riley&#39;s Mom&#39;s emotions are a literal mood"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,"I think it&#39;s really heartwarming that Joy has fully accepted Sadness for who she is, and how important she is for Riley. And I like already how Fear and Anxiety are fearful/worried about two completely different things: Fear is worried for more concrete concerns in the present, anxiety is worried about more abstract concerns that could or could not be in the future. Fear is worried about the possibility that Riley could get hit in the mouth with a hockey puck (which is rational and easily fixed), Anxiety is worried that if Riley does not make a good first impression on the cool kids that in the future she will not be popular/have friends (which is irrational but feels oh so important now that she has to or else she will be thinking about it for the next year)."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Ok, the way Sadness connected immediately with Embarrassment is honestly so cute<br><br>Edit: 4.9 thousand likes?? Damn!"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,I like how they tie in the emotions with ordinary teenage tropes like wanting to fit in and abandoning old friends for new ones
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> i love how they used the expression &quot;bottling up emotions&quot; literally."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,The fact that Anxiety is the villain and tries to take control and get rid of other emotions is so accurate. That‚Äôs my anxiety right thereüòÇ.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=88"">1:28</a> this is genuinely the first time I&#39;ve ever seen a teenage character with acne but where its just a normal part of their design and not a visual gag or being made fun of and it honestly made me so happy to see it"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Okay, I wasn&#39;t expecting Anxiety to <i>literally</i> bottle up Riley&#39;s emotions, but that&#39;s a really cool twist! Really hyped for this movie!"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"Bro 10 years ago I watched this movie with my family members in the cinema as a 10 year old boy, now I‚Äôm a 20 years old man and some of the family members I watched this with have either passed away or started families of their own. This nostalgia is really putting my life into perspective and I just want to tell people reading this comment to enjoy every moment of your life, because you don‚Äôt know what would happen next."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I was not expecting the new emotions to take over Riley‚Äôs mind, now this is gonna be one epic of a movie."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,&quot;WE ARE SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS.&quot;<br>My entire childhood summed up in one sentence. üòÇ
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"The best part about this is that we can freely give our comments here, showing the actual audience it&#39;s trying to achieve here and I appreciate that. Inside Out was one of my favourite films as a kid and I remember replaying it every time during car trips, it was that good. Here I&#39;m hoping the sequel proceeds to be as good as its predecessor."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> The way Sadness called Embarrassment &quot;Big Fella&quot; is so adorable."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT JUST BOTTLE US UP!‚Äù HELP THAT HAD ME DYING THIS IS SO GOOD
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"When the first one ended, I immediately wanted a sequel to show Riley&#39;s emotions as she hit puberty.  I&#39;m so excited for this!  I&#39;m still traumatized by Bing Bong, so I hope there&#39;s no more trauma in this one."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"No one is talking about how the adults have the original 5 emotions, showing how strong these new ones are during your development years and also explaining why we didn&#39;t see these new ones in the first movie. Very nice to details!"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,"I really like the new emotion&#39;s designs, especially Envy having such giant eyes like she&#39;s admiring everyone around her. I also love how Embarrassment is a giant creature who always wants to feel tiny, kinda like how you feel like when you get emabrrassed."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Inside Out is one of those Disney movies where a sequel actually makes sense and could work very well
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Love Pixar for establishing fear and anxiety as two very different emotions. They&#39;re too commonly grouped together as synonyms rather than acknowledged as distinctive feelings.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=114"">1:54</a> ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a preview of the next 10 years‚Äù<br>Yeah that&#39;s accurate lol"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Embarrassment is just a big softie and I love him...
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,That bit with the sar-chasm is absolutely brilliant
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,That ‚Äòsarcasm‚Äô bit was genius.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"The way Anxiety said that her job is to &quot;plan for the future&quot; is soo accurate realistically, always trying to predict future situations at the expense of wasting time in present reality."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,I love Riley‚Äôs mum being like ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS a preview of the next 10 years‚Äù üòÇ
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Sadness being drawn to Embarrassment is adorable ü´∂
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Suppressed emotions?<br>Oh yes Depression is certainly gonna make a grand entrance. Pixar bout to feed us peak cinema
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,The plot looks a lot better than I thought it would.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=101"">1:41</a> &quot;we are suppressed EMOTIONS&quot; best line ever prove me wrong"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Envy: green with envy and makes you feel small like no one sees you<br>Embarrassment: makes you blush you feel big like everyone can see you<br>Ennui: lacking bright colors and feeling droopy like there&#39;s no energy in your body<br><br>Love how the way they personified the new emotions
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I wasn&#39;t quite sure if a second Inside Out was necessary, but there&#39;s clearly a lot to explore in regards to puberty and emotional development as a teenager. I could see this being Pixar&#39;s first genuine financial hit in 5 years a la &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, but only time will tell."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"as a teenageer, calling Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear &quot;surpressed emotions&quot; is actually so realistic and this is the first disney movie im excited for in ages."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=124"">2:04</a> This is even worse emotional damage than that from the first movie<br>Riley&#39;s mind is LITERALLY falling apart from the whirlwind of new emotions<br>Genius little detail that really isn&#39;t so little"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Emotional baggage<br>Bottled emotions<br>The SarCasm!<br>The amount of literal emotional jokes in the trailer alone is insane!<br>This gonna be epic, props to the writers!"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=41"">0:41</a> &quot;oh yeah, not happening&quot; she&#39;s such a mood"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"So Anxiety is the antagonist with Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui.<br>They literally bottled the important emotions!!"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"I love the idea of literal personification of anxiety throwing out other emotions in favour of itself, very good analogy of real life for many.<br>Also can&#39;t wait for <i>exsistential dread</i> as an emotion, <b>my favourite!</b>"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,I love how they purposefully waited for all of us to grow up before realeasing the sequel.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,That ‚Äòsarcasm‚Äô bit was genius
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Like I said before, this is a Pixar sequel that seems necessary, especially that the new emotions are very relatable for a lot of people."
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,The fact that this video is not marked for YouTube Kids already gives me a good impression
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,The fact that they waited 9 years to release the second one now that most of us who grew up with this movie are teenagers now adores me. Like when I was a kid I could relate so much to Inside Out but now I&#39;m a teenager and only this trailer is so relatable.
Inside Out 2,2024-03-22,"&quot;Well, that was a preview of the next ten years.&quot; Was so real"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"Envy and disgust are holding eachother, THATS SO ADORABLE <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=53"">0:53</a>"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,Embarrassment is so cute and the way sadness calls him ‚Äòbig fella‚Äô my heart just sank
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"&quot;We are suppressed EMOTIONS!&quot;<br>Well, that&#39;s a clever way to portray it lol! I can&#39;t wait to see this movie üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è<br>Edit: I just watched it for the 5th time I think?... I&#39;m not crying YOU&#39;RE CRYEINFG"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=125"">2:05</a> Sar-CHASM üò≠üò≠ OMG I LOVE THAT!! I&#39;M DYING, The way joy sounded so intensely sarcastic üò≠üíÄ"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-16,Anxiety suppressing the other emotions is genius. This looks incredible!!
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEjhY15eCx0&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> DISGUST HOLDING ENVY IS SO CUTE AWW"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-09,"I have a theory. So envy starts out all small and cute with sparkles in her eyes and a little voice. Well what if the more she wants, and the more they feed into her, she gets bigger and meaner and like won‚Äôt stop at any costs. I think that could possibly play a role in her character. Idk how that would work out though. It would just be cool to see that"
Inside Out 2,2024-03-07,Its smart to make anxiety a villain. the MC is growing up and most people do tend to get anxiety and more stress. good work!
Inside Out 2,2024-03-08,"Seeing Riley more grown up, going through puberty and experiencing that teenage experience is so emotional to me. I love the new emotions, because as a teenager it‚Äôs so accurate. I can‚Äôt wait to watch Inside Out 2 it looks so fun &amp; exciting."
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-22,"&#39;Do you wanna build a snowman?&#39;<br><br>&#39;YES, but i cant&#39;t&#39; LOL"
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-23,"It&#39;s taken 24 years, 10 movies, a reversed retirement and a studio change, but Wolverine finally looks like Wolverine. LFG"

Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-23,Can we all agree that Hugh Jackman looks great for his age? He is 55 years old and the man is still killing it as wolverine!
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-05-09,"How poetic it is that both Deadpool movies start with him talking about Wolverine in some capacity, and he finally gets to hang out with him here, and with his mouth intact this time."
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-05-04,1st Movie: Love<br>2nd Movie: Family <br>3rd Movie: Friendship
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-07-15,Ketchup and Mustard is the best duo

Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-22,This feels so wholesome just two friends saving multiple universes and franchises.
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-05-02,Crazy to think that FOX was reluctant to even make a Deadpool movie. Now he‚Äôs the reason anything they had going is still going
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73_1biulkYk&amp;t=95"">1:35</a> Watching Wolverines claws come out through those little opening on his gloves is always so satisfying to watch."
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-22,"Was that a Doctor Strange portal at the end they went through? Alright, alright. I&#39;m sold Marvel. Take my money."
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-22,Wolverine smiling when Deadpool puts the gun to his head is everything to me ü•π

The attention to detail in the easter eggs of this franchise is insane.
Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-04-22,"Wolverine surviving the test of time on the big screen after all these years, is a testament to Hugh Jackman&#39;s amazing portrayal of the character!!"

Wicked,2024-05-15,"I‚Äôd normally complain about a trailer showing pretty much every moment of the plot, but since I‚Äôm already so familiar with the show it just makes me glad to know they‚Äôre covering everything"
Wicked,2024-05-15,Ari‚Äôs first response to getting the role being ‚ÄúI love her so much. I‚Äôm going to take such good care of her.‚Äù Makes me so happy!
Wicked,2024-05-15,ariana and cynthia‚Äôs vocals are insane! the casting here is top tier!
Wicked,2024-05-16,&quot;Of course she does. She just pretends not to.&quot;<br>Respect! I know a lot of people have to act strong because otherwise they will be bullied.
Wicked,2024-05-15,Dude like I was crying when Cynthia said the line &quot;It&#39;s the wizard who should be afraid of me.&quot; They&#39;re gonna nail it. I swear!
Wicked,2024-05-15,"Anyone else LOVE how Ariana is keeping the influences of OG Glinda (Kristin Chenoweth) with her accent and mannerisms? She was right, she knew how to take care of Glinda üò≠"
Wicked,2024-05-16,‚Äúi‚Äôm not afraid. it‚Äôs the wizard who should be afraid of me.‚Äù even more chilling and i didn‚Äôt think that was possible
Wicked,2024-05-15,ari is fully channeling kristin chenoweth and i love it
Wicked,2024-07-07,I can‚Äôt wait to hear Cynthia sing Defying Gravity. Her voice is so amazing

Wicked,2024-05-15,Ariana‚Äôs natural comedic talent is just going to shine through these movies. She‚Äôs magnificent. <br>Cynthia‚Äôs poise and embodiment of Elphaba are nothing short of perfection.<br>I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to watch this trailer and the movies on repeat for years to come.
Wicked,2024-05-15,"ariana&#39;s voice sounds SOO different here, and it really goes to show how much she cares for Glinda and her determination to do the character justice."
Wicked,2024-05-20,"&quot; The best way to bring folks together is to give&#39;em a real good enemy. &quot; Well, that&#39;s damn true!"
Wicked,2024-05-16,Ariana and Cynthia‚Äôs vocals are absolutely flawless. Can&#39;t wait!
Wicked,2024-05-31,When Cynthia said &quot;I&#39;m not afraid. Its the wizard who should be afraid of me&quot; I got chills and her voice! CHILLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! And when she sang Defying Gravity I was bawling my eyes out!!!! I AM OBSESSED!!!!!<br><br>And Ari is amazing. She literally channels Kristin Chenoweth. And when she sings Popular I&#39;m like &quot;GET IT GIRL&quot;

Wicked,2024-05-15,WICKED gave us the song &quot;Popular&quot; in 2003 which Mika sampled for his &quot;Popular Song&quot; with Ariana Grande in 2013 and now Ariana is singing the musical version for the Wicked movie in 2024. I love full circle moments.
Wicked,2024-05-15,That looked VERY faithful to the stage show. And Jeff Goldblum. He just makes everything better. . . .
Wicked,2024-05-15,Cynthia Erivo will join the honorary list of &quot;EGOT&quot; performers after winning an Oscar for wicked!
Wicked,2024-07-15,I love that Ms. Grande sings ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù a bit like Ms. Chenoweth. I like that kind of homage.
Wicked,2024-07-16,This was my first Broadway play that I saw <i>on</i> Broadway and not just in my city. I was 14. I&#39;ve waited almost 10 years for this.
Wicked,2024-05-16,"Haven&#39;t had a fire musical since The Greatest Showman. <br>Man, please let this movie be a hit. We don&#39;t ask for much but a soundtrack."
Wicked,2024-05-15,"&quot;I COULDN&#39;T POSSIBLY THIS IS YOUR MOMENT, I&#39;M COMING&quot; LMAO SHE&#39;S SO ME"

Wicked,2024-05-15,WE‚ÄôRE MAKING IT TO OZ WITH THIS ONE
Wicked,2024-05-16,"Wicked is my favorite musical, I‚Äôm not even gonna pretend to have a critical thinking about this movie, I just wanted it to exist so much. But I‚Äôm sure Ariana and Cynthia did an amazing job. Not an Ari stan, but I‚Äôm sure she waited her whole life for this."
Wicked,2024-05-27,"From what we‚Äôve heard in the trailer, I‚Äôve never heard such an effortless, clear-as-a-bell tone as Cynthia‚Äôs Defying Gravity."
Wicked,2024-05-19,Can we talk about the fact that Oz is played by Jeff Goldblum?!?! OMG ü§Øü§Øü§Øüòçüòçüòç
Wicked,2024-05-16,"Y&#39;all understood the goddamn assignment with this trailer, man. The orchestrated music in the back half is so damn good."
Wicked,2024-05-22,"Never seen the musical, but I was OBSESSED with The Wizard of Oz growing up. I would rewind The Wicked Witch‚Äôs exit scene in the flames over and over because I thought it was the most magical thing I‚Äôd ever witnessed. I‚Äôm so excited for this movie. It looks spectacular."
Wicked,2024-05-16,"&quot;So if you care to find me, look to the western sky. As someone told me lately, everyone deserves a chance to *fly*.&quot;<br>Just one of the best lines.<br>Of course, there are so many great songs in this show, and I hope they use more than just the two."
Wicked,2024-05-16,"‚ÄúFor the first time, I feel‚Ä¶‚Ä¶wicked.‚Äù <br><br>Can‚Äôt wait to hear this line!!!"

Wicked,2024-05-15,"Can we please give a shout out to the art director, cinematographer, costume, and make up teams on this film? Wow, just WOW. The look and feel of this film is other worldly."
Wicked,2024-05-15,"I loved the every performance of the Wizard and the fact that Goldblum gets to be him brings me such joy. Godspeed, John Glenn."
Wicked,2024-05-16,"My mom is a descendant of Frank Morgan (the original Wizard from the movie Wizard of Oz)  I‚Äôm so excited to see the torch being passed to someone else, keeping the movie and the world of Oz alive."
Wicked,2024-05-15,"If ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù was any indication, Jon M. Chu knows what he‚Äôs doing when it comes to musicals; and this trailer definitely showcases how ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù is in good hands with him."
Wicked,2024-05-15,Ariana and Cynthia are going to shine in this movie!! üíöü©∑
Wicked,2024-05-15,"ARIANA WAS BORN to play this role, I can&#39;t see anyone else playing it. All the people that were being skeptical are gonna change their minds so fast lmao"

Wicked,2024-07-26,"Back in 2011, Ariana tweeted about her love for the Broadway show and dreamed that someday she could play Glinda. Now she&#39;s fulfilling her dream playing Glinda in this movie with support from Kristin Chenoweth herself, i&#39;m so proud of her"
Wicked,2024-05-18,"I&#39;m sobbing. As someone who has loved this musical for the better part of a decade and has seen it live in the most magical way, I can&#39;t wait to see this in the theater now. I hope many more people are touched by this story."
Wicked,2024-05-16,"Thank you for releasing the first musically oriented trailer in years showing that a musical is a musical. We as the target audience need to know they are musicals, we are in our own rights, artists, musicians, creatively minded humans, and this draws us in:)"
Wicked,2024-08-14,"<b>I saw this amazing production on Broadway. I saw it with my identical twin sister</b><br><b>who was dying of brain cancer at the time. Two months later she died and they</b><br><b>played...&quot;For Good&quot; during her life celebration. I am wondering if I can handle this</b><br><b>musical. I sobbed during the trailer.</b> <br><br>&quot;Who can say if I&#39;ve been changed for the better?<br>I do believe I have been changed for the better<br>And because I knew you<br>Because I knew you, because I knew you<br>I have been changed<br>For good&quot;<br>   <b>RIP Jude...I will see you one day...over the Rainbow to Heaven</b>"
Wicked,2024-05-15,Ariana is literally MADE for this role. She fits it so perfect i could die
Wicked,2024-05-19,Ariana really did her due diligence with glinda&#39;s voice for this film... now I have a better understanding of why she was saying that she truly and 100% immersed herself into this character.  and even to the detriment of other things in her life. now I get it.
Wicked,2024-05-24,"When she whipped her cloak and it billowed from the open window and  Cynthia&#39;s (Elphalba) voice roared with such raw emotion as she flung herself forward...That scene left me absolutely breathless and shook, it was so beautifully executed."
Wicked,2024-05-15,‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt possibly this is your moment!! I‚Äôm coming‚Äùüò≠üò≠üò≠ Ari is so perfect for this role
Wicked,2024-05-15,"Ariana looks like she&#39;s doing absolutely amazing at playing Glinda, and I absolutely love how the trailer is not afraid of advertising this movie as a musical this time, because everyone knows &quot;Wicked,&quot; so that would be terrible if it wasn&#39;t advertised as a musical."
Wicked,2024-05-23,&quot; something has changed withing me.. &quot; GUYS IM SOBBING
Wicked,2024-05-15,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COmYeLsz4c&amp;t=127"">2:07</a>! OMG ARI‚ÄôS VOICE IS PERFECT"

Wicked,2024-05-15,I love seeing Cynthia get the recognition she deserves ‚ù§
Wicked,2024-06-04,I&#39;ve watched this trailer thirty thousand times and it doesn&#39;t get old. That last riff with Elphaba going skyward makes me emotional every time.

Wicked,2024-05-16,&quot;Why is she Green?!&quot;<br>&quot;Well Tamar have you ever watched the show?&quot;
Wicked,2024-05-17,"The casting is spectacular in this movie. I wouldn&#39;t have thought Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard would work, but now it&#39;s all I can think of."
Wicked,2024-05-15,Ariana ate this UPPP. And so did Cynthia. <br>Michelle is icing on the cake. <br>I‚Äôm excited

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,1988 Michel Keaton: Wanna see me play batman and Beetlejuice? <br>2023 Michael Keaton: wanna see me do it again?
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"The fact that back in 88/89- Michael did Beetlejuice and Batman back to back, and now to come back as both over 35 years later is just too awesome!"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,It took 35 years for his head to grow back to make this sequel.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-08-12,"Wish my mom was still alive to see this with me, we both loved beetlejuice :("
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,I love how the sand worms still have that claymation aesthetic instead of being full cgi.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,36 years later and Michael Keaton hasn‚Äôt lost all that charm that makes him Beetlejuice and in one sentence makes me nostalgic and extremely happy to see him.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"If I wasn&#39;t somehow already sold on how flawlessly Michael Keaton slipped back into character or how they managed to get the original cast back, having Willem Dafoe on the castlist is the perfect bow on the gift to this generation."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,The ‚ÄúEEEK‚Äù just gets me every time it‚Äôs like a trained response for that first Beetlejuice to send him back
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"No matter how well the movie does critically and financially, seeing Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice again brings a huge smile on my face."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,It&#39;s amazing that Michael Keaton still manages to effortlessly switch from Beetlejuice Voice to Normal Voice even 36 years later in certain scenes.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-09-01,"NOBODY i mean NOBODY else could be beetlejuice. Michael keaton is absolutely incredible. I just watched the original again a couple hours ago and omg im so fxcking excited!

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,keeping the practical effects was the best decision they could‚Äôve made
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-07-21,I love how they kept the effects and budget down to make it more 80‚Äôs like
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-25,Needs to be said. Catherine O Hara still looks amazing 35 years later
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-08-29,Choosing Jenna Ortega as Winona Ryder‚Äôs daughter is PERFECT! üñ§
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-07-16,We all know that there now <b>has</b> to be a third and final movie that will be titled ‚ÄòBeetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice‚Äô.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Winona looks fantastic as Lydia after all these years..  <br>And Keaton is so iconic..   Whole cast looks great..   Can&#39;t wait..
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-28,"The fact they named it Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the freakiest part of the trailer<br><br>It implies if a third movie was made, a real one of him would come out like that Ring girl"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-08-30,I was 18 years old in 1988 when Beetlejuice was released.  Watched it in the big screen then and I loved it.   I&#39;m 54 years old and can&#39;t wait to see the squeal in the big screen!
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"&quot;I&#39;ve seen the exorcist 167 times and it keeps getting funnier, every single time I see it&quot;"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"The cast, the score, the plot, the director. A very messed up ray of sunshine to brighten everyone up."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-25,Keaton is really lucky to get to play 2 of his most popular characters in such a short period of time
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-09-04,I really like the fact they still have Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"‚ÄúLook, you‚Äôve been to Saturn! Hey, I‚Äôve been to Saturn. Whoa, sandworms, you hate ‚Äôem, right?‚Äù"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"Seeing Winona in the red dress again is very nostalgic, one of my favorite costumes from the original movie"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-06-07,Tim Burton + Danny Elfman + Michael Keaton = Gold
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-09-05,"I was very surprised to find out the ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a preview, be warned it‚Äôs intense‚Äù line wasn‚Äôt just made for this trailer‚Äôs intro and was actually in the movie instead."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-06-07,I like how Beetlejuice works at a scammer call center.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-06-04,I find it kind of funny how Michael Keaton is now the age i assumed he was 36 years ago when he first portrayed the character üòÇ
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-27,Michael Keaton is the G.O.A.T enough Said I grew up on the original batman and Beetlejuice and have the privilege to see them again is mindblowing. Hats off to truly a talented actor
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-25,I love how Winona Ryder was the og girl and now she is in Beetlejuice again
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-25,"michael keaton is literally one of the best actors hands down . It‚Äôs so crazy after so many years he‚Äôs able to perfect that role again , the cinematography looks absolutely beautiful, all the movie shots they show in the trailer looks so good ."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Can we just recognize the dedication of Lydia keeping the same hairstyle for so many years?
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-28,&quot;&quot;Grandpa is Dead&quot; was a quick and convenient way for the studio to address a HUGE problem lol
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Keaton is a legend. Who would have thought we&#39;d ever see the original screen Batman or Beetlejuice again more than 3 decades later?
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"&quot;Here&#39;s a preview&quot;<br><br>That was the best preview for a trailer without spoiling the trailer, thank you"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Winona is an icon and having her back in this legendary film couldn&#39;t be more perfect. BEAUTIFUL as always.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,I don&#39;t even care what the plot is. Just seeing Michael keaton back in this character is good enough for me.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"I like how the effects look like they&#39;re from the late 80s, early 90s. I gives a nostalgic touch to the movie"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"I love how everything looks like 80s. The special effects, the presentation"

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,You had me at undead Monica Bellucci.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"The cherry on top is the fact that instead of just calling the movie &quot;Beetlejuice 2&quot; they named it &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; and that&#39;s incredible!<br><br>It also makes me hope for a third movie to finally finish the joke.<br><br>Edit: <br><br>Although very obvious a third movie titled &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; is planned to be made next, nothing is guaranteed unfortunately. <br><br>Michael Keaton, and many of the other returning original actors are getting old and might not be available by the time the third movie starts production, the movie most likely won&#39;t be made if the actors aren&#39;t available. Even if all of the actors are still here, the movie itself will need to be green lit and have the funding to even begin said production. Even succeeding in those, there is still the possibility of the movie being shelved or abandoned abruptly.<br><br>A lot of things could happen that can stop the third movie from being made. Which is why I <b>hope</b> for a third movie to be made."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-07-18,Gosh I wish my grandmom was here to see this. Literally made me cry watching this. She introduced me to the original. She had it taped over one of my moms dance recitals üò≠üò≠üò≠
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"This actually looks really good, and the fact that Burton went back to practical effects here is even better ‚ú®Ô∏è"

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,My childhood has been resurrected. Hopefully there&#39;s time in the afterlife for Keaton to make Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Something is telling me the 3rd movie will be called &quot;bettlejuice bettlejuice bettlejuice&quot; check back 36 years from now.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-08-19,It took Tim and Michael 35 years to finally make a sequel.

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-27,"I love the stop motion throwbacks. Am I the only one who hates how incredibly clear and clean modern movies look? There was a certain misty look the 80s and 90s films had that gave it an atmosphere, does anyone else notice it?"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Beetlejuice: &quot;I&#39;m gonna make you so happy.&quot;<br><br>Now THIS.... Puts a smile on my face!

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,My Mom was big on Tim Burton&#39;s classic movies and showed them to me as a kid. I was obsessed and we bonded over them. Now as an adult I get to take her to see this one. :)
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-29,I just appreciate that it&#39;s not a remake! Or a prequel! An actual sequel?!
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,<b>&quot;I am going to make you so happy.&quot;</b> You just did.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,"Looks like Winona Ryder carries the movie, which is awesome.  There&#39;s no point passing the buck when you can still carry your own."
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-08-21,Waited 30+ years for this.  Unquantifiably stoked.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,Michael Keaton is that friend you barely see but when you do it‚Äôs like you never missed a step can‚Äôt wait for this awesome movie !!! wtf all of you in <b>AWMKPX</b> ??
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,Catherine O‚ÄôHara nailing her only word in the trailer ‚Äú ugh ‚Äú lol
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-24,When I seen Willem Defoe I turned the trailer off....not because I didn&#39;t like him. It&#39;s because I don&#39;t need to see anything else to convince me to see this movie. I&#39;m sold
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-23,"Lydia &#39;88 - &quot;No, mom. Is not a stage&quot;.<br>Lydia &#39;24 - &quot;See?&quot;"
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,2024-05-25,"I‚Äôm usually over all of the reboots and remakes, but a ‚ÄúBeetleJuice‚Äù sequel/reboot, I‚Äôm here for. I‚Äôm optimistic that they never rushed a sequel or franchise because they wanted to wait until they got it right. I will definitely be seated in theaters to see this."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"Gary Oldman cast as the sand worm, that dude is so versatile fr"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"They pulled lines directly from the book, specifically Stilgar saying to Paul, &quot;keep it simple, nothing fancy. We know you are brave.&quot; Im so pumped, Denis is a true fan of this world/lore."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-10,"Denis Villeneuve is literally the saviour of the sci fi genre in cinema. Arrival, Blade Runner, Dune. As a sci fi lover i&#39;m so glad an amazing director like him has such a passion for this genre."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-13,"My dad cried at the end of Dune part 1 because he never thought he see something close to any kind of realisation of these dense books, was a real moment. Can&#39;t wait to take him to see this he says the next half is even better. Shout out Denis Villeneuve, single handedly bringing back block buster scifi that isn&#39;t Marvel or DC and also making gritty or inspiring masterpieces like Sicario or Arrival. Truly a master"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"Something that I don&#39;t think people recognize is truly terrifying about the final shot of every Fremen saluting Paul: Fremen culture dictates that once a crysknife is unsheathed, it <b>cannot</b> be sheathed again before drawing blood. Every person in that horde has vowed to spill Harkonnen blood just by unsheathing their knives."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"What Denis Villeneuve is doing right now is nothing short of saving movies. From story to shots to sound and at this scope and scale, no one is doing what Denis is doing right now. Please protect this man."
Dune: Part Two,2024-02-29,My favorite part was when Paul shouts ‚Äúsilence‚Äù at the Reverend Mother and she flinches and staggers backwards üëåüèΩ
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-08,The detached delivery of ‚Äúmay thy knife chip and shatter‚Äù is PHENOMENAL. Absolute perfection. Muad‚ÄôDib time.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I think my favorite part of these movies is it feels like a real world. The set design, costumes, furniture, and the items the characters use all feel like real items in a real world. Also, the level of care for the source material is awesome to see."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,Hans Zimmer knows how to make the audiences feel connected to the movie.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,I want to thank the CGI team for making this a stunning masterpiece. I can tell this took a painful amount of time to make this look so breathtakingly amazing. You guys must be proud of your work. Thank you very much!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"Dune is honestly the reason why I write my own stories. It was a life changing experience to have read it at the age of fifteen. I am now forty-nine years old and even if I NEVER get my works published, I can still create my own &quot;realities&quot;. Thank you Frank Herbert for the gift that you have bestowed on my life and thank you Denis for masterfully bringing my childhood imagination to life."
Dune: Part Two,2023-06-02,‚ÄúI wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: &#39;May be dangerous to your health.&#39;&quot; - Frank Herbert
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"My father was the biggest fan of &quot;Dune&quot; (books and old movies). He was so excited when the 1st trailer came out. Unfortunately, because of the heart, he passed away. When part 2 comes out, I will watch it and he will be there with me in spirit. I hope you like it, Dadüò¢"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-02,YES! I CAN&#39;T WAIT! The second half of the book is even better than the first half and Denis Villeneuve is the best director working rn so I expect this to be even more incredible!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Got chills at the end. ‚ÄúMay thy knife chip and shatter.‚Äù Remembering the scene from the book just gets me sooooo hype
Dune: Part Two,2023-06-01,"I love the part where Paul tells Chani, &quot;I don‚Äôt like water. It‚Äôs wet, and cold, and irritating... and it gets everywhere. Not like here.&quot; Truly a line for the ages."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-05,Goosebumps at Chalamet‚Äôs ‚ÄúMay thy knife chip‚Ä¶and shatter.‚Äù
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"Okay just about everything in this trailer is amazing but can we take a second to appreciate Javier Bardem as Stilgar. His cadence, delivery, facial expressions, everything just feels straight out of the book. There&#39;s gonna be some stellar performances in Part 2 but him talking to Paul using dialogue directly from the book gave me chills and made me tear up, he is so perfect as Stilgar. SO much love for the source material is on display here, I genuinely cannot wait for this film."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"2 years in the making, hopefully this movie delivers and become of the best sequels in a film franchise. The VFX is mesmerizing. The texture, lighting, sand and shadows. Can we just appreciate the time and effort and applaud the VFX artists? They deserve the praise for their work."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"I got goosebumps, literal goosebumps. Thank you Denis for your passion for this story and bringing it to the world. For those of us that have loved these books our entire lives, we see how much love and attention to detail you give this."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Timoth√©e&#39;s well expressed anger in &quot;That&#39;s not hope&quot; gave me chills.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-05,"A book series, with a universe of lore to rival that of Lord of the Rings, made into a duo of films that is faithful to the source material and, on top of that, actually entertaining. What a time to be alive."
Dune: Part Two,2023-09-05,"&quot;A longstanding dream of mine is to adapt Dune, but it‚Äôs a long process to get the rights, and I don‚Äôt think I will succeed&quot;<br>-Denis Villeneuve, September 2016 during the &quot;Arrival&quot; promotion<br><br>And now he&#39;s fulfilling his dream in getting a chance to adapt his beloved sci fi story, i&#39;m so proud of him üëç"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-06,"As a fanboy of the original Dune novels, you have NO IDEA how much joy this trailer brought me."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"Part 1 was not just any movie. It was a new experience that i never felt with other movies. Immersive, deep, joyful, and while it was slow pace, it was right for the space and story. Hope they bring part 1 back to theaters before part 2 release, and I&#39;ll definitely watch it one more time."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,All the book references are killing me. This is recreation done right.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"Denis is one of the best living directors today. He is giving the books fair due and providing new audiences with a taste of Herberts masterpiece. The production design, sound and visuals along with the acting are top notch. A must see on the largest screen possible. Long live the filmmakers."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Finally. A movie that&#39;s not Marvel or DC. That everyone is hyped for. I&#39;m so for this.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"The face Stilgar does in the moment of revelation (when Usul rides Shai hulud) its priceless, its peak cinema, is adaptation at its best. Javier Bardem as Stilger is probably my favorite casting choice in this whole project."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"This honestly sent shivers down my spine. After reading the book when I was young I have been craving an adaptation that does it justice. The first film was incredible, but this just looks unreal. Villeneuve is the best in the game right now. It&#39;s like he&#39;s managed to reach into my mind and take my visualisations from reading the book and transferred them straight to screen... but even better."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"I&#39;ve no words to describe how much I love Villeneuve and his works. The atmosphere of his movies is unparalleled. I&#39;m very excited, and I&#39;ve watched this trailer twice."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,The cinematic world that Denis Villeneuve has given us is just incredible. The way he captured the book and the everything Frank Herbert created is just amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see this second part!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I live in a world where Dune is now a more respectable franchise than Star Wars. What a time to be alive. Cant wait, Part 1 blew me away"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,Part where he explains oceans to people living in a world of desert and her inability to imagine it Gives me goosebumps!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I can‚Äôt believe Dune is finally getting it‚Äôs due now. I grew up in the novels, original, and SyFy movies. Now Dune is getting all its proper due. Thank you for this, and thank you Frank Herbert for this incredible series."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"The second half of the novel is such an incredible ride of emotions and it‚Äôs absolutely incredible that they captured that in just a few minutes. I‚Äôm literally shaking at how unbelievable and beautiful this looks. Denis, thank you for giving us a faithful and amazing adaptation. Here‚Äôs to Part Two!"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"The first Dune movie was one of the best sci-fi films I&#39;ve seen in a long time, and this trailer is making me even more excited for Part Two. The visuals are stunning, the cast is incredible, and the story looks even more epic than before. I can&#39;t wait to see this movie!"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,The first movie was mesmerizing! The visuals and sound design were outstanding. Everytime Zimmer blasts his bombastic score alongside the majestic sceneries that shroud the screen was amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see this one!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I have legit tears, someine has done frank proud and given his story the love it deserves. I wish my father could have been here to see this masterpiece come to the big screen. I am beyond ready for this."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Way9Dexny3w&amp;t=127"">2:07</a> God timoth√©e‚Äôs acting is on absolute point, you can feel the rage"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"The way Paul says &quot;May thy knife chip and shatter&quot; gave me shivers, it sounds exactly like Jamis said it. Eerie, and I love it!"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I read Dune several times as a kid and teen. These recent movies are both close to my mental images of the characters and world, but times ten. I love it."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,I haven&#39;t been this hyped for a movie in years. This looks completely epic and so true to Herbert&#39;s vision. I can&#39;t wait to see this on the biggest possible screen.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"It&#39;s very rare that a movie trailer gives me goosebumps, this one did. I&#39;m so psyched for this one!"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"‚ÄúIt is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.‚Äù<br>‚Äï Frank Herbert, Dune"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-02,Long live the fighters!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,I‚Äôve never read Dune but I‚Äôm so happy I live in an era were a movie adaptation looks this stunning
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-07,What I felt when I watched this trailer is that the film continues with the same footprint as the first and that&#39;s incredible. I wish the cast and this second part much success.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"2 years the making, hopefully this movie delivers and become of the best sequels in a film franchise. The VFX is mesmerizing. The texture, lighting, sand and shadows. Can we just appreciate the time and effort and applaud the VFX artists They deserve the praise for their work."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-07,"Star Wars is dead, Dune is king."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"I LOVE how it looks like Princess Irulan is taking a voice memo. That&#39;s a really clever way of giving her a natural, logical way of giving us her thoughts like the quotes from her between chapters in the first book (I only mention the first because it&#39;s only one I&#39;ve read so far but I plan on reading the rest)."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-06,The random woman cheering for Paul riding the sandworm. Goosebumps! That‚Äôs what I loved about the first film. Random characters rehearsing parts of a prophecy as we watch the second it‚Äôs fulfilling itself. Like Kynes asking Paul where he learnt to strap his boots like that and starts whispering &quot;He shall know your ways<br>as though born to them.&quot; Those definitely where my most favorite moments in the first film..<br>Denis Villeneuve is such mastermind for creating feelings like this!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Part 1 was the most faithfully-crafted adaption I&#39;ve seen since LOTR. I&#39;m really looking forward to this. So many franchises could learn how to do it right from Dune.
Dune: Part Two,2023-06-11,this movie needs to cross $900 million on the worldwide box office. It deserves to be.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,I‚Äôve literally watched this trailer 5 times and goosebumps every time! This is more then a movie it‚Äôs pure passion from Denis Veleneuve and you can feel it watching the trailer!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-02,The book is a masterpiece and the first film did a stunning job capturing the scale of Dune. Part 2 is sure to be a cinematic triumph!
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"It has been decades since I read Dune, but Hebert&#39;s description of how the Fremen would pry back the scales on the worm to stop it from diving back under the sands stayed with me.  It was as inventive as the highway system in Caves of Steel where Asimov imagined a system of conveyor belts where each belt moved slightly faster or slower than its neighbor so a rider could enter, accelerate, decelerate, and exit by walking across the belts."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"Part 1 was done so well, I can&#39;t wait to see the sequel. Congratulations to everyone involved in this project, you have done a great thing bringing the Dune universe to life for a modern generation of viewers"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"After reading over 4000 pages of Dune, I can confirm it is a life changing experience that I will never forget. I am very happy with the work they&#39;ve done in the first movie and can&#39;t wait to see it in this one... and maybe more"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-07,"That ending shoot just gave me a<br>Some real goosebumps, as a novel reader it&#39;s just felt amazing to finally see how your imagination became real"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Got chills at the end. &quot;May thy knife chip and shatter&quot; Remembering the scene from the book just gets me sooooo hype
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"I hope when Dune part 2 comes to the theaters, part One comes back so we can see it in the theaters again. What a wonderful movie."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,Dennis Villeneuve is amazing. I loved Blade Runner 2049 and I love his adaptation of Dune
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Way9Dexny3w&amp;t=105"">1:45</a> the moment stilgar realizes that he is the student, not the teacher. Also that lion roar use of Paul&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; is sick. I can&#39;t wait to hear it in full force when he comes out of the cave."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-06,This is such a great tribute to the original. The adaptation was done flawlessly.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Can‚Äôt put it into words how excited i am for this. The fact that it comes out only 2 years after the first movie is also very praiseworthy. The trailer looks amazing without giving away too much either.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,"This how a trailer should be, no spoilers, no flashing montage, just pure hype.<br><br>Edit: I have not read the book. People saying that there are spoilers but I didn&#39;t get it. So, technically it spoils nothing."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-05,"The worm riding shots here gave me goosebumps. The trailer has a largely &quot;more of the same&quot; feel to it, yet I&#39;m hyped. Excited to see what else Villeneuve has in store for us (I really hope they show the Guild Navigators)."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"Denis has a flawless resume so far. Arrival, Prisoners, Enemy, BR 2049...he&#39;s a master at the craft and his thoughtful attention to detail and storytelling ability sets him apart from most directors working today outside of maybe Nolan. Dune couldn&#39;t have fallen into better hands, I can imagine how awful it could have been had anyone else taken the reigns."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,Words cannot describe how hyped I was from the moment I left the cinema after watching Dune part 1 for the second one. I wasn&#39;t really familiar with the book nor the previous movies and didn&#39;t now what to expect. Now I know that the impact that Frank Herbert had on modern Sci - Fi and how well Denis Villeneuve captured it. Hope that Dune not only will match the significance of Star Wars in movies and Pop Culture but also exceed it.
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"The first movie is a complete masterpiece . The cinematography , the performances , and the scope is so freaking good . This second part looks awesome ( Denis Villeneuve you nailed with the first movie ) . I really hype for Dune part 2 ."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"After seeing the first Dune movie, I picked up the book and devoured it. So excited to see such a faithful adaptation of the book&#39;s greatest moments."
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-03,"Denis Villeneuve is absolutely amazing. To me, it&#39;s not just a film he is making but kinda paying a tribute to Frank Herbert. No director can show the love and respect for the book it deserves. Going to hit this!! MAY THY KNIFE CHIP AND SHATTERüôåüèºüôèüèº"
Dune: Part Two,2023-06-27,"Move over Star Wars, The King has returned and it looks incredible"
Dune: Part Two,2023-05-04,The best thing about Villeneuve is the sheer comfort of knowing his movies will never disappoint.
Twisters,2024-02-12,The original movie was an inspiration for me to become a meteorologist. This past year I got to be on my first research campaign chasing tornados. And then this comes out. I feel like I‚Äôve come full circle.
Twisters,2024-02-12,the cow flying across the road in the first movie is still iconic
Twisters,2024-02-12,"What made Twister (1996), so iconic<br>1. Bill Paxton<br>2. Philip Seymour Hoffman<br>3. Helen Hunt<br>3. Van Halen Soundtrack<br>4. 1995 Dodge Ram<br>5. Cows<br>6. F-5 Tornados<br>7. Aunt Meg‚Äôs Breakfast<br>8. ‚ÄúThe Suck-Zone.‚Äù <br><br>I just don‚Äôt think you can capture the magic of the first."
Twisters,2024-02-12,I remember seeing the original with my dad in theatres.<br>RIP Old man. I‚Äôll be seeing this one and thinking of you.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"R.I.P. Bill Paxton, I may have been born in the early 2000s, but twister was my most favorite storm movie."
Twisters,2024-02-12,"God, I can&#39;t believe it. They literally parked the movie vehicles in the grocery store lot behind my house during the filming of the original when I was a kid. I touched Barn Burner. The crew stayed at the hotel right next to the same grocery store. We drove out to the sets when they weren&#39;t actively filming. I&#39;ve crossed the &quot;cow&quot; bridge. I have such a strong emotional connection to the original. I just can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m so stoked... and also sad that my mother isn&#39;t here to witness this. She would&#39;ve loved it."
Twisters,2024-02-12,"If the MPA rating description isn&#39;t &quot;intense depiction of very bad weather,&quot; we riot."
Twisters,2024-02-12,"I will admit, this is one of those VHSs I watched over and over again as a kid. Never thought it‚Äôd get a sequel"
Twisters,2024-02-12,Please don&#39;t mess this up. I&#39;ve been waiting nearly 3 decades for this.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"Twister was what started my childhood fascination with tornadoes, and now, that fascination is getting reignited."
Twisters,2024-02-13,R.i.P. Billy Paxton. Always a treat to watch you on screen sir... gone but not forgotten.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"The film‚Äôs font face is so iconic, you can literally tell what it is just by the first letter."
Twisters,2024-07-18,"I‚Äôm 36 soon to be 37, born in the late 80s and raised up through the nineties and early 2000s.  Twister is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I‚Äôm so darn nostalgic these days that when I saw this coming out I actually got teary eyed.  I absolutely cant wait to go watch this.  I‚Äôm a Floridian and a central Florida area local so I‚Äôve been blessed to enjoy the attraction at Universal Studios Orlando many times.  Storm chasing tornados would be my literal dream job but like I said, I‚Äôm here in Florida and I don‚Äôt foresee me changing careers now and heading out to the Midwest.  I can only dream and watch these Twister movies."
Twisters,2024-02-17,It&#39;s crazy the original is 28 years old and still holds up quite well.
Twisters,2024-02-13,I am from India. I was in 6th grade when my Father took me and Mom to Twister. I will return the favor this time. <br>RIP Bill Paxton\Philip Seymour.
Twisters,2024-02-12,Seeing this makes me realise how good the first movie still looks.
Twisters,2024-02-29,Twister will always hold a special place in my heart. Excited for the sequel to honor the original cast and storyline!
Twisters,2024-02-13,"I swear my mom had Twister, Aliens &amp; Jurassic Park on repeat when I was a kid üòÇ"
Twisters,2024-02-12,I wish Bill was here to see how many people still love his work in the original. I hope this film lives up to the incredible expectations.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"Good to see so many Twister fans here, lol. I ran that VHS ragged when I was a kid."
Twisters,2024-02-12,Twister is what introduced me tornadoes and storm chasing as a toddler and the fact we are getting this now in my 30th birthday year is absolutely insane. I can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie!!!
Twisters,2024-02-12,Please live up to ‚ÄúTwister.‚Äù Please. That‚Äôs one of my favorite childhood movies ever.
Twisters,2024-02-17,Seeing that red truck was so surreal. It means more to me than you know! R.I.P Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Twisters,2024-02-12,Glenn Powell really is racking up the movie roles these days.
Twisters,2024-02-13,This is what got me to apply to film school at 18 and have an over 20-year career in the industry. I got to work with Bill twice and it was simply magical every day. I am so thankful this storyline is back.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"The director of Minari is directing it, so I have faith that he can have memorable characters with great dramatic depth to them, which made the first film so special to this day."
Twisters,2024-02-12,I love to see Twister come back on TV every year.  Reminds me that the hell of winter is over and spring is coming. Love me some thunderstorms with an occasional hint of tornado.
Twisters,2024-02-28,I‚Äôm 31 now and twister was one of the first movies I remember watching with my mom as a kid.  It‚Äôs so nostalgic to see a sequel!
Twisters,2024-02-12,I went to school with Glen Powell. He‚Äôs a good dude and I‚Äôm very happy for his success.
Twisters,2024-04-22,"I&#39;m just going to say this.  The first movie,  is iconic.  It is the reason I have such a love for storms,  and stormchasing. PLEASE DON&#39;T RUIN THIS MOVIE!"
Twisters,2024-02-13,Twister brings back a ton of 90s nostalgia for me. Its the reason why I fell in love with weather and storm chasing. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt were the best. Not to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty! RIP so many great actors. I hope this is a good sequel and honors the first movie!
Twisters,2024-02-12,Twister was my grandmas favorite movie ever and today is 13 years since she passed so seeing this today made me tear up. So very excited! Hope it‚Äôs a good one
Twisters,2024-06-23,"If Twister is getting a sequel, I want a sequel to The Day After Tomorrow!!!!"
Twisters,2024-03-20,The original is one of the greatest movies of all time!!  I owned it on VHS and it was the first DVD I purchased after I purchased my first DVD player.  I hope this honors the original as well as Top Gun Maverick did Top Gun.
Twisters,2024-02-12,"Bill paxton and  helen hunt&#39;s  chemistry and acting of the great ensemble cast ,the flying cow , 1996, the release of the vhs of twister was so epic and iconic back then ."
Twisters,2024-07-13,"I remember after Bill passed away, all the storm chasiers came together to spell BP. RIP Bill we miss you!"
Twisters,2024-02-12,"I watched the original in the theater 5 times. That ERA of 90&#39;s Summer Blockbuster&#39;s was awesome. Twister, The Rock, Con-Air, Independence Day, The Matrix and many more. They certainly don&#39;t make them like they used to. Bring back Original fun popcorn movies Hollywood."
Twisters,2024-05-28,I love the way  big heavy vehicle flies away but the people are still running! üòÇüòÇ
Twisters,2024-02-12,R.I.P Bill Paxton Twister is my 1 of top 2 movies ever I hope it lives up to the original! üí™üèæ
Twisters,2024-05-02,Twister was in 1996 and the graphics/effects were ahead of it&#39;s time. One of the best action movies of the 90&#39;s and I remember getting the VHS and being super excited. Watched it so many times.
Twisters,2024-05-10,I know this is for the generations that didn&#39;t grow up with the original...but seriously...nothing can be better than the original
Twisters,2024-02-12,Brings back memories of the original Twister movie. Especially the sensors!
Twisters,2024-02-14,I was obsessed with Twister (1996) while growing up. It&#39;s so cool to see a whole new generation get to enjoy their own version of what i used to love.
Twisters,2024-02-12,Twister was the very first movie my mom took me to see in theaters as a child. She was looking forward to the sequel but sadly passed away last year. It&#39;s going to be hard seeing this without her.
Twisters,2024-02-12,I just saw the Super Bowl ad for this and a minute later here I am
Twisters,2024-02-12,I always find it funny when a tornado picks up vehicles but the people are fine.
Twisters,2024-04-22,"As a trained storm chaser for the National Weather Service in Texas, I&#39;m excited to see this come back after 27 years. I have been around since the original in 1996 &amp; have that VHS behind glass in a display case to this day. Rest in peace Bill Paxton &amp; Philip Seymour Hoffman &quot;Dusty.&quot; Bill Paxton would be very proud to have seen his ideas come to life. They are gone, but not forgotten. I will be seeing the sequel for myself.<br>Edit: make it 28 years old as of May 10th."
Twisters,2024-02-26,"Ironically, The 1996 movie was never developed to be the masterpiece gem it is today. The producers thought that it would be just a fun B list movie for the 1996 summer. They weren&#39;t looking to set or break any records with it yet it became the 2nd highest grossing film of the that year."
Twisters,2024-02-12,The 12 yr old in me back in 1996 is so excited for this. I always wished they would do another.
Twisters,2024-02-13,I can‚Äôt think of a movie that needed a sequel less than Twister
Twisters,2024-07-16,Dude I literally burst into tears seeing that this was coming out.<br>I remember when my mom brought it home. It was when I fell in love with meteorology and storm chasing. <br> <br>Mom I wish you were still here to see this with me.<br><br>If your favorite channel was The Weather Channel raise your hand! ‚úãüèΩ
Twisters,2024-02-12,The kid in me that was obsessed with tornadoes after seeing Twister in the early 2000&#39;s jumped out when I saw this trailer. The way I knew what was coming right from that first letter in that font we all know and love. This one definitely captures the soul of the original and I&#39;m so excited to see what they&#39;re bringing with this one. We&#39;re in for a REAL storm this summer and I can&#39;t wait.
Twisters,2024-02-12,Man Twister was my favorite movie as a kid 28 years ago. I hope this doesnt disappoint.
Twisters,2024-02-12,RIP Bill Paxton and Phillip Seymour Hoffman! They made the first one iconic. I hope this one lives up to the legacy they left.
Twisters,2024-02-12,What made the first Twister great was memorable characters and the great chemistry between them. I hope this movie can bring some of that too.
Twisters,2024-02-12,I don&#39;t think I even know how many times I have watched Twister as a kid. <br>I am looking forward to this one
Twisters,2024-02-14,"I have Twister on VHS, dvd and Blu-ray and Prime for a reason.. This was the most epic flick and must have seen it a 1000x times. Twister and the original Jurassic park. Golden age."
Twisters,2024-02-20,"Nothing will ever out do, the original Twister movie. It&#39;s been one of my favorite movies since I was eight years old. Fell in love with tornados then. I feel its one of those movies that should never be attempted to be re-done ever."
Twisters,2024-02-12,I have been a fan of Twister since I was a kid and it&#39;s the sole reason I began studying meteorology and have for almost 30 years now. A big and special thank you to Helen Hunt and especially to Bill &quot;The Extreme&quot; Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman. None of that would have been possible without you.
Twisters,2024-03-13,"Twister is probably still one of the best disaster movies I&#39;ve ever seen, can&#39;t wait to see this remake."
Twisters,2024-02-12,"R.I.P Bill Paxton twister one was a classic.I remember seeing it as a little kid back in the day, hopefully this film is just as good as the first."
Twisters,2024-02-12,There is only 1 Twister film and this one will not replace it!
Twisters,2024-02-12,I hope the movie lives up to the expectation cause twister was a masterpiece. One of the finest tornado movies to ever made in world cinemas
Twisters,2024-02-17,Ill never forget the Drive In scene of the original. It was terrifying but epic and exciting at the same time
Twisters,2024-02-12,In my teenage years I lived for these kind of movies. I am so glad they bring back Twister. Please be good!!!
Twisters,2024-02-12,Finally another tornado film for us tornado geeks to enjoy! IT&#39;S THE WONDER OF NATURE BABY!
Twisters,2024-02-12,Didn&#39;t know I needed a sequel to Twister until I saw this trailer. RIP Bill Paxton and Phillip Seymore Hoffman
Twisters,2024-02-12,RIP Bill Paxton
Twisters,2024-02-21,"SpongeBob: ‚ÄúBarnacles, what can be worse than a giant twister?‚Äù<br><br>Patrick: ‚ÄúOh I know, two giant twisters.‚Äù <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdok0rZdmx4&amp;t=93"">1:33</a>"
Twisters,2024-02-12,This one is going to hit SO DIFFERENT now that I&#39;ve LIVED in tornado alley for 15 years! I can&#39;t WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!
Twisters,2024-07-17,Seen every Twister movie out there ONCE! but there‚Äôs only one I‚Äôve seen a MILLION times. The 1996 original! And it stays in regular rotation bc a classic never dies.
Twisters,2024-06-07,"I remember seeing the original in theaters, still watch it every few months. Nothing can top the original!"
Twisters,2024-02-12,The visual in the original was what set it apart. This feels very safe.
Twisters,2024-04-26,"Hey Hollywood, come up with new ideas....  This one has been done and done perfectly the first time.   RIP Bill Paxton"
Twisters,2024-02-14,"Many people have expressed surprise that the original is still so beloved by people who were kids in the &#39;90s. I think a big part of that is that on top of some really great character acting by several beloved actors, the original &quot;Twister&quot; was one of the first films ever to be released on DVD. It was often used in home theater retail spaces to sell people on big screen TVs and surround sound at home, which were also things, that had not been available before. It&#39;s testament to great sound design and VFX (for it&#39;s time). The original had a heavy hand in changing how we see movies in the modern era. I&#39;m rooting for this film. I hope they wow us again."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Godzilla seems to be super saiyan Rose this time
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,Never in a million years would I have  thought we would get King Kong and Godzilla running togetherüòÇ
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-06,I like how Godzilla went from barely walking in 2014 to full-on sprinting 10 years later.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-02-15,2014 - Let them fight<br>2019 - we join the fight<br>2021 - make em fight<br>2024- make a tag team and let them fight.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-01-16,"This is the one series where I don&#39;t even care if it&#39;s a bad movie, I just want to see big monsters."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,Godzilla and Kong running side by side like the two main characters in a buddy cop movie is the goofiest thing i&#39;ve seen and I love it.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Godzilla running while also moving his arms is the most normal thing I&#39;ve seen today
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"Crazy how the Monsterverse started with a &quot;serious&quot; tone and then started to put more &quot;absurd&quot; stuff. Just like the classic Godzilla era, and I love It."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-01-10,The scene of them running like superheroes is goofy af but also immensely satisfying and entertaining. Go get him boys!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-01-01,Godzilla: For thousands of years I lay dormant. Who has disturbed my-<br>Kong : Hey best buddy<br>Godzilla: Oh it‚Äôs you
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-05,"The fact that we just got Godzilla Minus One and now this, truly is something special. Cause Godzilla can be anything. A hero, a villain, a force of nature, etc. Just like Toho&#39;s films."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"We have to appreciate the courage of the director, cameraman and actors for working with such huge monsters."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"2021: We need kong, the world needs him<br>2023: We need Godzilla, kong needs him<br><br>Crazy how time changesüòÆ"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,king kong now has a thanos glove
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Godzilla is the perfect example of &quot;Doing the same concept a thousand times and still making it fresh and exciting&quot;
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-07,It&#39;s crazy how Godzilla has evolved. Went from barely walking in 2014 to running so fast.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,It went from a battle that seemed like it would never end to a united friendship that will never end
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-06,They should be part of the Family for the next Fast and Furious show too. Imagine both of them driving fast
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1OOlGwExM&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> &quot;ITS GONNA BLOWWW&quot;üòÇ"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,Can&#39;t believe Kong has the gauntlet and the Infinity Stones. üò≥ü§£
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,its kind of incredible that Japan offers dark thought provoking movies like the original 1954 Gojira while legendary offers us goofy showa era wrestling matches back and forth year after year. it&#39;s a damn good time to be a Godzilla fan!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Godzilla has better running form than DCEU Flash üòÇ
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"Whether its the Monsterverse or Toho, if it&#39;s good or bad, let&#39;s all be glad we&#39;re still getting Godzilla movies"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,This movie is gonna be a guaranteed masterpiece if Godzilla does his dropkick.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"I‚Äôm really hoping in this movie, after Scar King is defeated, Kong will lead the new Kongs and finally be crowned his iconic name: King Kong."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,I love the part where Kong screamed ‚Äú Monsters! Assemble.‚Äù
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-06,2014-Godzilla<br>2017-Kong Skull Island<br>2019-Godzilla King of the Monsters<br>2021-Godzilla vs Kong<br>2023-Skull Island Tv Series<br>2023-Monarch Legacy of Monsters<br>2024-Godzilla x Kong the new Empire<br>I cant believe how far we have come!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,I love how the monsterverse is slowly becoming just as batshit insane as the later Showa movies
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"So a lot of people who aren‚Äôt familiar with the older Godzilla eras are gonna complain about these movies becoming more super hero in nature. It was said that this movie is gonna have some elements from the Showa Era of Godzilla, where the monsters have more human personalities. Honestly, I‚Äôm here for it."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-05,Looking forward to the new movie!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1OOlGwExM&amp;t=60"">1:00</a>-I like how Kong actually gets into a fighting position and readies himself for combat. In GvK he either charged in blindly or let the enemy come to him."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,A great way to Celebrate Godzilla and King Kong‚Äôs 70th and 90th Anniversaries respectively.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,I need Godzilla to do a drop kick sliding on his tail like the ancient Godzilla movies üòÇ
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,I can‚Äôt believe that we are living in a time like this where we get to see more Godzilla and Kong teaming up again. Who would‚Äôve thought of this when Godzilla (2014) was released?
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Hearing Godzillas roar always brings a tear to my eyes
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"Godzilla‚Äôs continuous roar always gives me goosebumps. The longer it is and the louder it gets, the more you realize he‚Äôs something else entirely. I hope to see it in this film."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"I really like how heavy Godzilla felt in 2014. They move so quick now<br><br>Edit: I‚Äôm still going to watch the movie. Also to the dude who referenced the old Godzilla movies with jumping drop kicks and flying with atomic breath not being realistic, I SPECIFICALLY SAID 2014. Also 1.5k in an hour is crazy."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"Seeing Godzilla running like an Olympic athlete seems all wrong but then I&#39;ve also seen him doing the no hands tailed kick thing, so anything goes I suppose"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"To think we went through a 10 year Godzilla drought between Final Wars and 2014. Now we have Godzilla releases in tandem, Toho dropping Minus One with the serious tones and Monsterverse dropping those classic Showa tones.<br><br>What a great time to be a G-fan."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-07,Godzilla and King Kong running together is an iconic scene. I will watch this movie in theaters only for this scene alone.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"That shot of the two of them running is the dumbest thing I have seen in my entire life, I will be there"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1OOlGwExM&amp;t=134"">2:14</a> &#39;&#39;Ahw yeah, smile to the camera Godzilla baby!&#39;&#39; &gt;:)"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,It&#39;s really cool that Godzilla and King Kong are fighting together.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,That last shot of Godzilla and Kong sprinting side by side gives me cheesy showa era Godzilla vibes and I love it.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"I love how the Monsterverse has evolved from grounded in reality, natural disaster and a humanitarian crisis in a world of giant monsters, to literal Showa-era Godzilla fun and goofiness and I love it !"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,The fact that Godzilla and King Kong are running together and that this is perfectly normal in a Godzilla movie goes to show how ridiculous the franchise gets. That‚Äôs what I love about Godzilla you have a base idea of him but anything can happen.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-23,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1OOlGwExM&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> that charge up sound for his atomic breath never gets old."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Is anyone gonna ignore the fact that Kong has a freaking infinity gauntlet!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-02-12,Godzilla just went from Super Saiyan Blue to Super Saiyan Rose ü§£
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"Seriously for a Godzilla fan,you couldn&#39;t have asked for a better next year than this...there are like 3 movies/series about it already."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"I love the versatility of these movies. A godzilla film can simultaneously be a thought-provoking and chilling masterpiece, while another godzilla film can be a fun action film with bonkers monster fighting. either way, it works amazingly"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-16,"&quot;Blue,  yellow pink whatever man, just keep bringing me that&quot;<br>-Tuco Salamanca"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2024-03-22,&quot;KONG HAS THE GAUNTLET!&quot;<br><br>-The Avengers
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,I&#39;m really hoping that Godzilla only runs like that during the big final fight because he&#39;s like supercharged and eager to fight due to his pink glow. Hopefully during most of the film he&#39;ll move like how he normally does.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"Can we just all agree that this is a great time to be a Godzilla fan? Whether you enjoy the more action-packed monsterverse or if you enjoy story driven Godzilla like Minus 1( phenomenalmovie!), we have so much to enjoy!"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-06,Can you imagine how the cameraman felt when Godzilla and Kong was charging and he still had to get the shot. What a brave soul.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,With Minus One along with Monarch series &amp; this coming out next year‚Ä¶it is a great time to be Godzilla fan.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,I am just happy to see the monster-verse is continuing and Kong and Godzilla are back and  ready to team up 2024 is not far away!!
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"One of the best choices they made in Gvk was making the story revolve around the monsters instead of the humans, really hoping this is the case as well"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,I love the part where Kong said<br>‚ÄúI am inevitable.‚Äù
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1OOlGwExM&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> I thought that was Kratos as a kong for a sec"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"You know, the Monsterverse is one of the few movie franchises that the creators still seem to care about as much as the fans. I&#39;m SO excited for this. I always have a great time in the theater when one of these comes out. WHY CAN&#39;T IT BE 2024 YET!!"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"On one hand, this trailer had perfect timing, given Minus One&#39;s American release. On the other, the dichotomy between the two films is hilarious. One is a dramatic masterpiece, and this looks like a mindless popcorn flick (which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing)."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,"I&#39;ll be honest, I did not expect Legendary to be the ones doing the goofy-fun Godzilla movies while Toho does the really serious, grounded ones, but I am totally here for both.<br>I just wish they made it clear that was the direction they wanted to go since the first Monsterverse Godzilla was pretty good."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,I guess both of them have a common enemy is now a <b>certified friendship moment.</b>
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-05,Hot damn son. Kong has the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla has gone superman and absorbed all the radiation. This movie is already üî• then you got a nice contrast between Kong and Godzilla. Kong is calm and peaceful but can be a savage. Godzilla is either sleeping or slaying. Dude has no chill lol
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-05,"I kind of love the Godzilla evolution.  It‚Äôs like every main weakness he had against mechagodzilla has been fixed.  He now seemingly has much more agility and speed, longer and stronger arms for better brawling combat, and a much more potent base atomic breath.  I still don‚Äôt know how anything can ever top his nuclear aura from King of the Monsters, but we‚Äôll see."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"Has anyone noticed that Godzilla‚Äôs body shape changed into something that looks like Mechagodzilla? Slightly longer arms, slimmer build? He also seems faster and more agile too.<br><br>It makes me wonder if he evolved this way as a result of his battle with the Mecha in Godzilla vs Kong, so now he‚Äôs more prepared to fight something like him."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"I hope they can still make them look big. I feel as we are progressing monsterverse, there size is visually normalising, there size is comprehansble/matching compared to environment.  Like when they run that&#39;s cool, but imagine if they can choreograph the scene in a way that they actually look massive in size (by eg ,maybe giving human size reference point ) while running with there massive bodies at incredible speed"
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-03,"This is sick cause there‚Äôs a Godzilla movie for everybody. If you like good writing, drama you got minus one and if you like stupid big dumb awesome monster fights you got the American Godzilla. Hope this movie makes my brain do a happy."
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,2023-12-04,Seeing Godzilla running like a person is all kinds of weird‚Ä¶
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-26,&quot;You need a job&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a US Marine sir.‚Äù &quot;You need to deploy&quot; üòÇüòÇ

Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-26,This is one franchise I will never get tired of. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are one of my favorite duos lol.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-30,how does this manage to have the aesthetic of a true 2000‚Äôs movie. the days when visiting the movie theatre was nostalgic

Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-26,Love seeing Martin be energetic again. He&#39;s one of our GOATS for this reason!
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-27,The use of drone footage is straight out of Michael Bay&#39;s playbook. Love how much they pay homage to the films before with the callbacks and camera angles. Even the skittles haha
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-27,Oh man that hotdog scene is straight comedy LOL that angle of Martin checking out the dogs is gold.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-26,"We ride together, we die together, BAD BOYS FOR LIFE"

Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-03-26,Bad Boys 4 &amp; Beverly Hills Cop 4 in the same summer‚Ä¶..I‚Äôll take it. This one actually looks as good as the first one.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024-05-22,Martin Lawrence is slowly turning into Big Mamma for real.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,I love how Jim Carrey said he‚Äôs retired unless ‚Äúa script of gold comes to him‚Äù. This must be a script of gold

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Shadow doing the Akira slide is actually iconic
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,The fact that this franchise started out as an oncoming trainwreck and has now turned out to be the most peak set of video game movies in modern time is actually insane. This film looks so peak already and i can tell it&#39;s gonna be the most emotional one.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Remember when we all despised the first design and thought the movie would fail. Now we have an anticipated threequel
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Shadow using his motorcycle as a little &quot;jump&quot; to clash with Sonic in the end is straight up raw

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a colorful bunch‚Äù is the one line you can actually imagine Shadow saying when it comes to Team Sonic and I LOVE IT!!!!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Shadow: Riding his motorcycle <br><br>Sonic: &quot;That was an illegal left by the way&quot;
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,If Shadow says ‚ÄúGive me a gun.‚Äù In this film my day would be complete.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,It&#39;s crazy how this movie franchise went from the trailer with the first design being a meme to everyone being hyped about this trailer and finally after months it ACTUALLY came out
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,&quot;You&#39;re a colorful bunch&quot; <br><br>His first line is also literally the most Shadow line ever!!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,&quot;What did you do?!&quot;<br>&quot;What I had to&quot;.<br><br>Woo! Chills. Absolute chills.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Shadow doing the Akira slide SOLD ME SO HARD!!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Love that they‚Äôre keeping Shadow‚Äôs backstory intact.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Jeff Fowler was a CGI movie designer for the opening of the Shadow the Hedgehog game. Now he recreates his same shots 20 years later.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"&quot;Yes! Keanu! You are a national treasure.&quot;<br>-Sonic the Hedgehog, 2020"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Jim Carrey casually playing as 2 Characters :<br>This is getting out of hand, Now there are two of them."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Let‚Äôs take a moment of silence to acknowledge and appreciate how Paramount Pictures listened to their Fan Base and decided to rework the 1st film. Without the 1st film we would‚Äôve not gotten these beautiful sequels! üôè
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,&quot;So you&#39;re going to be playing a hedgehog-&quot;<br><br>Keanu: &quot;Ok.&quot;<br><br>&quot;that likes motorcycles.&quot;<br><br>Keanu: &quot;I&#39;m in.&quot;
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,&#39;You&#39;re a colorful bunch&#39;<br>Keanu understood the assignment :)
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,‚ÄúIt all starts with this. A trailer containing the ultimate hype‚Äù - Shadow
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"What I love about Keanu‚Äôs Shadow is that he isn‚Äôt doing his regular voice for him, he actually softens it up and delivers his lines very calmly, which fits Shadow so much!!"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-10-12,The fact that Eggman looks more and more like Eggman as this franchise goes on is actually a nice touch.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"This is peak cinema right here. The colour grading, shots, Shadow&#39;s design and backstory remaining intact, Keanu as Shadow, Carrey back both as Robotnik AND Gerald, the action, the music, everything about this trailer slaps so hard.<br><br>This is the best time to be a Sonic fan right now fr."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Shadow the Hedgehog live action + THE KEANU REAVES as his VA. What a blessing. Shadow doing the Akira slide might have caused me to shed a tear.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,The first movie walked so the second movie could run.<br><br>The second move ran so the third movie could CHAOS CONTROL.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Seeing Shadow on the big screen is going to be absolutely insane!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,They actually put Gerald in üò≠ this movie is about to be PEAK
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,The way Shadow leaps off of his airborne motorcycle before falling into a headfirst dive before punching Sonic is just full of the exaggerated swagger of a black hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-11-23,Keanu Reeves actually was so interested in Shadow. He did some &quot;independent&quot; research to understand the character.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"&quot;If I can&#39;t rule the world, I might as well save it!&quot; <br><br>I&#39;m hooked"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Great Shadow character design - Check,<br>Lore accurate backstory - Check,<br>Voiced by Keanu Reeves - CHECK! <br>Yeah, we are watching this movie!"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Man Jim Carry is an absolute film legend, I&#39;ve never seen someone so talented who does it just for the love of the game. You can tell he loves being in these movies"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,Shadow‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a colorful bunch‚Äù. everything the ultimate life form says is always top tier dialogue!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,"Ironic that in the first movie Sonic calls Keanu Reeves a national treasure, and then years later, Keanu stars as the voice of one of his most challenging adversaries; I love it! ü§©"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,Shadow is literally a Sonic-ized John Wick here.  No wonder they got Keanu for this.  Best decision ever
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,&quot;You&#39;re a colorful bunch&quot; Okay KEANU NAILED HIS VOICE! AND HIS PERSONALITY
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"When Shadow said, &quot;People keep asking if I&#39;m back and I haven&#39;t really had an answer. But now, yeah, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; I&#39;m back,&quot; I felt that."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Everything about shadow is on point.<br><br>His presentation, his design, his voice, his movements, the use of the hoverboots, the rollerblade run, chaos control, everything, even the dark edgy vibe is present . They couldn&#39;t have done it better!!"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-11-21,I can&#39;t even begin to describe how much i love Jim Carrey. His delivery of &quot;papa&quot; genuinely caught me off guardüòÇ
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-10-23,Keanu going &quot;You&#39;re  a colorful bunch&quot; gets me every time üòÇ he&#39;s really channeling his Johnny Silverhand with that comment.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,This doesn‚Äôt feel like a typical video game or even sonic movie. They nailed just how serious the shadow threat is!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,That ‚Äúlive and learn‚Äù motif at the very end is just nostalgic <b>chefs kiss</b> <br><br>They are really doing Sonic and Shadow justice.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"&quot;He is much more impressive than the Hedgehog I fought previously.&quot;<br>&quot;Dude, I&#39;m standing right here!&quot;"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-10-01,Every Shadow voice actor up until now deepened their voice a bit to sound cool.<br>Keanu is just using his normal voice. xD
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,Jim Carrey ALSO playing Gerald Robotnik is an idea I&#39;ve had in the back of my head since the movie got announced. So glad they are actually doing it!
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSu6i2iFMO0&amp;t=68"">1:08</a> &quot;You&#39;re a colorful bunch&quot; Keanu please üò≠üò≠"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"It&#39;s amazing to see how far the live action Sonic films have come. From its first infamous trailer to a trilogy.<br><br>Holy cow! 1,000 likes!"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,Keanu makes Shadow less of a teen trying to be edgy to a man with cold fury.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,I absolutely love Jim Carrey! That &quot;found some&quot; scene is perfect timing and delivery.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,How this movie went from a meme to a TRILOGY is unbelievable
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Imagine going from the original design to Paramount, listening and fixing the problem to now getting Shadow on the big screen. Take notes, Hollywood, if you give the people what they want, they&#39;ll show up day one."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,FINALLY! A movie trilogy where the next movie keeps getting better! They‚Äôre extremely rare.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Shadow has every right to be a villain, but in the end, he will save the world."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Sonic and Eggman teaming up, Gerald Robotnik is back, Shadow looks epic, I&#39;m so hyped"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"I love that the second Knuckles decides to fight Shadow first, Shadow already had managed to be one step ahead to use about 1% of his true power."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,&quot;What did you do?&quot;<br>&quot;What I had to.&quot;<br>The convo after Sonic saw Shadow peeing in a hot topic.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,"&quot;Shadow only found pain and loss&quot;, like literally every Keanu Reeves characters he have been played...and his actual life üòû"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Jim Carrey playing both Dr. Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik is something I&#39;ve never thought I would see
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,"So glad Keanu voices Shadow, it suits him so fricking well and I love it. Keanu is truly a national treasure"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-10-28,Paramount should have a Guiness World Record For their comeback. They went from having the worst Sonic Design and not even having a movie to having the most peak set of videogame movies and now we are getting a 3rd one.  W Paramount
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-28,I love how Gerold‚Äôs reveal at the end gives off that every Eggman pretty much has the exact same personality when it comes to being a genius.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Ok, but for real, this movie looks WAY better than the last two movies. The lighting and everything just makes come together so perfectly."
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,KEANU IS LITERALLY THE PERFECT SHADOW
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"Paramount said, &quot;Forget cooking, we&#39;re putting that on the GRILL&quot;"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSu6i2iFMO0&amp;t=152"">2:32</a> that Akira bike slide tho <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b>"

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,The Sonic Adventure 2 nostalgia is <b>HEAVY</b> in this trailer. Brings a tear to my eye.<br><br>Gotta love the Akira Easter egg too.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,2024-08-27,Dr. Robotnik: I thought you were dead.<br>Gerald Robotnik: My death was‚Ä¶ greatly exaggerated.
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,"The best words of this book is when Atlas says- &quot;In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position of fall in love again, fall in love with me. You&#39;re still my favourite person Lily&quot;.  Best words ever"
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,"this looks way better than I was expecting. the flower shop is exactly what I envisioned. still not sold on the guy playing Atlas, but that&#39;s okay!"
It Ends with Us,2024-05-18,&quot;Fifteen seconds. That‚Äôs all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we‚Äôll never get back.&quot; This line always hits hardü•∫ü•∫

It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,"15 seconds that all it takes, still remembering reading this n it just blew my brains off i cried like a baby."
It Ends with Us,2024-07-29,"This is the exact reason I left my daughter&#39;s father at 8 months pregnant.  I refused to have her grow up thinking it was ok or acceptable for a man to treat a woman in any way less than I want her to be treated. I will always love him, but my daughter and her best interest will always be my #1 priority."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,i screamed when my tears ricochet started to play
It Ends with Us,2024-05-19,I feel like I&#39;ve already seen the entire movie from this trailer

It Ends with Us,2024-06-06,"the rooftop, the flowershop, and the old house r exactly how i pictured it"

It Ends with Us,2024-05-17,Imagine Blake saying ‚ÄúI know a girl who<br>has the perfect song for this‚Äù
It Ends with Us,2024-08-08,"I haven&#39;t thought about it in years but my first grown up adult relationship when i was 21 years old was with a man who would blow up on me and physically threaten me, and i would leave.  He would beg and plead for forgiveness and swear to never do it again.  I&#39;d come back 2 weeks later and within a month he would do it again.  Back and forth for a year.  The day he pulled his gun out and held me down i swore that if i got out of that house alive I&#39;d never see him again.  And i kept that promise.  I didn&#39;t go back to gather my things.  I got away with a small bag of stuff and my life.  I moved to another city for 6 months and then another state.  He found me on social media a couple years ago and acted like nothing ever happened."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,Blake Lively looks so beautiful in It Ends With Us!
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,Okay but Jenny Slate as Allysa is actually perfect casting tho????? Her quirkiness and that voice just matched the Allysa i had in mind while reading the book
It Ends with Us,2024-05-20,I can imagine Blake suggesting my tears ricochet to this movie
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,the flower shop is SO pretty and i love blake as lily but i think the trailer spoiled a lot!! i was sooo shocked reading the book and i feel like a lot of things got revealed already

It Ends with Us,2024-07-30,"very interesting since justin baldon NOT ONLY directed it, but apparently put himself in as the villain - in real life he is SUCH a gentleman, worships his wife."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-21,The fact that Justin Baldoni directed this and is Playing Ryle is the most Justin Baldoni thing he did
It Ends with Us,2024-05-19,"Dear Ellen,<br>  We&#39;re going to be a movie. And deep inside I hope Ryle is not the villian...<br> &quot;For Better , For Worse...‚ú®&quot;"
It Ends with Us,2024-05-18,"This Novel has a very special place in my heart. It is my first novel. A girl who i love recommend this book to me. She gave me her novel to me for me to read. I really love her. And i am so grateful that she recommended this book. I felt in love with it. She promised me that she will lend me the second part of the novel but sadly it never happen. I like her a lot and she likes me too. But i made some stupid choices and ended this beautiful bond between us. I was so scared to take the leap of faith. I ended us before we even got the chance to start, to grow together. And i deeply regret it.....I wish i could turn back time and change it.<br>I miss YOU HIPPO...<br>And I am sorry.<br><br>I hope you are doing well. And I hope all the great things in life happen for YOU. You deserve it.<br><br>I don&#39;t even know why i am sharing this here... its not like she gonna see this."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-19,The person who act as atlas both young and adult have something in their aura that so peaceful grace. And voice of atlas is amazing.
It Ends with Us,2024-05-17,This book was so good explaining how complicated being in love with an abusive husband can be.. moving from love to accepting it is not really love at all. Movie Looks so good!
It Ends with Us,2024-05-19,"I just love when Justin acts, he&#39;s always brilliant.."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,The fact that it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy tears ricochet ‚Äú in the background and Blake is starring in it makes it so exciting
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,I&#39;ve never particularly rated Blake as an actress but it looks like she&#39;s doing a stellar job here. That &quot;what would you say to her?&quot; gave me chills.
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,IM LITERALLY CRYING. THIS LOOKS SO GOOD AND SO TRUE TO THE BOOKS. HOW COULD ANYONE HAVE DOUBTED BLAKE AS LILY OR JUSTIN AS RYLE? They are so perfect for their respective role. I‚Äôm already in tears. FREAKING CANT WAIT.
It Ends with Us,2024-05-18,when taylor swift&#39;s song just fit seamlessly with the movie trailer had me so emotional!!! the trailer looks great
It Ends with Us,2024-06-26,Blake is literally the most beautiful woman in the world !
It Ends with Us,2024-05-17,It is one of my favourite novel...<br>I cried when Lily and Ryle talked about her daughter in the end...<br>Lily said to her daughter &quot;It&#39;s end with us&quot;.

It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,I AM BLOWN AWAY..BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG..I LOVE THE BOOK.. CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIEü•πüò≠
It Ends with Us,2024-05-17,"I have tears in my eyes. My ex best friend had read this book and gave it to me to read it, back in 2018. Now I see this trailer it gives me so much flashbacks of our good times together. Wish I could see this movie with her but too bad the friendship was toxic so we cut off contact. Still, I miss the good moments."
It Ends with Us,2024-07-26,"Just like Lily, I fell in love with Ryle as I was reading the book despite knowing his bad temper. Maybe that‚Äôs what love is, and there I understood why battered women are seen foolish in the society for staying in a toxic relationship. I cried a lot when Lily came to her senses and divorced Ryle. But then, I realized that breaking the cycle of abuse is the best move for a woman. Love alone is not enough in a marriage."
It Ends with Us,2024-06-03,"Everyone saying Atlas is not that pretty as in the book but in my opinion he was a gentleman,sweet, understanding,caring,soft and loving  in the book and he seems exactly the same here."
It Ends with Us,2024-05-24,omg it gets so much more real when you actually see the scene play out. when im reading the book im thinking how could she ever forgive him but just seeing the way he touches her and looks at her it hits so differently im so grateful i will be able to see this
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,"Finally an honest film about brutal abusive relationships. This needs far more awareness!! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª<br>I‚Äôm wishing this opens new films, education, media to raise awareness. And the myth of ‚Äúthe weak female figure‚Äù and the ‚Äúpassionate but aggressive male‚Äù<br>Very proud of the message: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre breaking the pattern because it won‚Äôt break us. No way!üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <br>Keep on doing more empowering<br>Movies with strong female characters. We‚Äôre in 2024!!!!!"
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,I froze when he pushed her downstairs while I was reading the book. This story represents really well what it‚Äôs like being in a toxic/abusive relationship. Can‚Äôt wait for the movie!
It Ends with Us,2024-05-16,It‚Äôs beyond me how anyone thought those two weren‚Äôt suited to play Lily and Ryle. So much of this film looks like what I had pictured in my head after reading the book and I see that other people feel that way too. Must be a sign of great writing from Colleen and even better directing from Justin üòä
It Ends with Us,2024-05-18,i&#39;ve re-rewatched this trailer for an unhealthy amount of times now... i can&#39;t wait for august 9th üò´

The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"Now this is a good trailer. No dialogue that explains the plot, no corny jokes. Just good visual spectacle."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,This movie feels like one of those shorts that finally got a chance to become a movie everyone needs.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,What drew me in this trailer was the lack of dialogue. That is so refreshing you have no idea. Really hope this does well
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,"It warms my heart to see an honest-to-goodness quiet, meditative-looking children&#39;s film coming out in this day and age."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,Not the trailer making me cry already. I haven‚Äôt been this excited for a movie in a LONG TIME. THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED!!!!! ORIGINALITY!
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"My sister bought this book and it&#39;s sequel for my daughter when she was around 5. I read it to her every night, and she loved it so much she didn&#39;t want to attend a sleepover she was invited to because she&#39;d miss a night of hearing about Roz. It was one of the few books I legitimately enjoyed reading to her, and it was so difficult not reading ahead after she&#39;d inevitable fall asleep. I can&#39;t wait to see this with her. I&#39;m so happy to see it&#39;s being done by DreamWorks."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,So that‚Äôs where the Megamind 2 budget went.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,"Considering that this is the last film DreamWorks made entirely in-house, it does show how much passion and heart they put into this film. This following its unique animation style is the reason why I&#39;m supporting this film."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"The robot&#39;s bravery, courage, empathy, compassion and kindness are too beautiful for this world."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,This almost made me tear up. The line ‚ÄúWe must become more than what we were programmed to be‚Äù at the end gave me chills and pretty much sums up my life right about now. This is absolutely beautiful. A pure work of art.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,"WHY DO I FEEL LIKE CRYING ALREADY?!?!  I hate when movies touches my heart with nature and animals. :&#39;)<br>It&#39;s been really long since we had any movie like this, that showed so much emotion and beauty through scenes with no dialogue. I feel like this is gonna be a extremely precious gem that needs to be protected at all costs.<br>DreamWorks, you better make this really good!!"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,"i dig literally everything about this. the art direction, the animation, the main character, the world, and putting that remix of &quot;what a wonderful world&quot; hit me like a truck. since its already a song that brings me nostalgia for nothing, this makes it hurt more."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,Robot looks like she was actually going to cry near the end of the trailer despite not being able to  have tears. That&#39;s good animation
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,The overclocking and glowing from the approximation of joy when the goose nuzzled the robot is so cute.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"as a 3d artist im pretty sure all of the design team had a blast working on this one , the visuals and the artstyle looks so amazing."
The Wild Robot,2024-04-20,"According to a Deadline reporter, a studio executive told him he cried all the way through the last hour of the movie. This is a good sign."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,&quot;Nature and machines don&#39;t have to be against each other&quot; is a nice message these days
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,Went from not even knowing this book existed or that this movie was even in production to legitimately getting chills watching this. This is now one of my most anticipated movies of the year.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,Wow....a trailer for an animated movie with essentially no dialogue...got me teary-eyed. Here&#39;s hoping for all the success in the world for this film!
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,Never In my life did I ever thought to be so emotional over a trailer. This movie looks incredible and reminds me kind of the iron giant.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,"For those who didn‚Äôt know, this was based on a book story which had more than 2 parts in the series. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Wild Robot‚Äù where a Robot adopts a little duckling. I‚Äôm happy this is getting its own movie. The book was perfect.<br><br>At first I thought this was a different type of story. But I realized this was based on a book that I read."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"When i heard people saying on Twitter that &quot;this trailer is phenomenal&quot; i didnt believed them at first... Now i just watched it, and i can say its one of the most beautiful trailers ive ever seen."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE I THOUGHT A TRAILER WOULD MAKE ME CRY WITHOUT ANY DIALOGUE üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"No cheap corny tropes, no low quality animation mistakes.  This is a promising movie dreamwork don‚Äôt mess it up<br><br>Update : they didn‚Äôt disappoint üéâüéâüéâ"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"I think it would be interesting if this movie had absolutely zero dialogue, and it‚Äôs just a scenic masterpiece"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"This is the best trailer I have seen in a long time! No distracting dialog, and no spoilers. Film makers have lost the art of making a true trailer, and they seem to give away too much of the plot in the viewing of this teaser of a short that is designed to catch your interest and wanting more! I am happy the art of trailer making has not completely died off! Well done, this looks like a movie I would love to see in the theater! For a trailer to evoke emotion speaks volumes!"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"I&#39;ve changed my mind I actually shed tears<br>I&#39;ve never seen a movie trailer be executed so flawlessly. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but man am I glad they do"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"This trailer made me cry, isn&#39;t it odd how it&#39;s making so many of us cry with so few words and just music and visuals? It&#39;s tugging at something we&#39;ve forgotten and long for."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"We just saw this trailer at a kid‚Äôs movie today. After the trailer before it, which also had something similar to a robot (totally different themes and animation), my son said that it made him think of The Wild Robot, a kid‚Äôs novel we both adored, because wouldn‚Äôt it be great if they made a movie of The Wild Robot. You can then imagine how excited we were when the next trailer began with the robotic eye blinking open and the sea otters. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs The Wild Robot!‚Äù He said, ‚Äúno‚Ä¶is it?‚Äù I said, yes that‚Äôs Rozz‚Ä¶ and sure enough! The animation looks beautiful, and the trailer looks faithful to the book, which is absolutely wonderful. We are autistic, and the book really resonated with us and our other non-neurotypical friends. I teared up a little in the theater tbh. SO SO THRILLED for this movie!"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,"This is my favorite genre of anything. Quirky robot exploration that ruins your emotions.<br><br>The Iron Giant, Wall-E, Overwatch&#39;s &quot;The Last Bastion&quot; short... can&#39;t get enough of it."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,POV: Wall-E finally finished cleaning up and unlocked the level 100 skin
The Wild Robot,2024-03-13,"I have not audibly said &quot;Wow&quot; to a trailer for anything in quite some time, the way I did with this one. Essentially no dialogue, and I am already fully enthralled and enraptured in the story of this Robot."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-11,"I teared up watching this trailer because reading these books to my son at night was such a joy. This story is so touching and even though it&#39;s about a robot, it&#39;s so deeply human and emotional. This is my kiddos favorite story, and the time we spent together reading it seems to have become one of those &quot;core-memory&quot; moments for him, so even watching the trailer - just tears."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-05,I am absolutely freaking out! IT LOOKS SO GOOD!! So glad they finally made it a movie!
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,This Trailer had 95% no dialogue yet it still showed way more emotion than the entire Lion King Remake(2019).<br><br>Edit: After watching the second trailer I still love this one better.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"It‚Äôs rare that a film- no, a TRAILER for a film almost made me cry, but this is special<br>I grew up loving animals and, as a neurodivergent kid, often related more to them than to my peers. Now, I‚Äôm about to graduate and looking for a degree in ecology and/or art, which honestly isn‚Äôt a combo that I see often. But this? I can already tell this is going to be gorgeous. So dreamworks, from the bottom of my amateur field worker heart, thank you."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-05,"Listen, I‚Äôve gotten 3 hours of sleep in the past day, I‚Äôm in art school struggling to stay passionate about my work in my final semester of college (I love art, I love it so much it kills me). I‚Äôm genuinely a little in tears watching this. To clarify: this is so beautiful and screams that the people working on this loved it so much I‚Äôm crying<br>Edit: you guys are all really sweet!!!<br><br>Edit 2 (Nov 2024): I really appreciate all of your support!! Happy to say I graduated (with honors!) with my bachelors of fine arts and while I‚Äôm not exactly in the industry, I‚Äôve gotten to do some character design work and am hopefully in talks with an author looking for an illustrator for children‚Äôs books! In the meantime, I‚Äôm still drawing, still creating, and still dreaming! And yes, I did watch Wild Robot opening weekend and cried my heart out (I started crying 5 minutes into the film because it was so pretty to look at üòÇ)"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,God the trailer alone looks like one of those amazing animations that randomly pop into a youtube feed for enjoyment and tears
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,WALL¬∑E and iron giant are some of my favorite movies. the way this trailer alone brought me to LITERAL TEARS!! I‚Äôm actually so excited for this I love when movies make technology and robots mix with beautiful nature!
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,now THIS is the future of animation. Why am I emotional over a film I haven&#39;t watched yet?!
The Wild Robot,2024-04-21,"As a school librarian I read this book to my students when it first came out, and they fell in love with the story. It looks like the movie is going to do it justice. Can‚Äôt wait to see it!"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"The segment between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vbA5ZJdKQ&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vbA5ZJdKQ&amp;t=132"">2:12</a> deeply resonated with me, especially after losing my cherished parrot. It was heart-wrenching and brought me to tears. This movie appears to be beautifully crafted, emotionally touching, and truly remarkable. Hope it&#39;s a big hit."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,Its a blessing to see an animated film that has better animation than Disney&#39;s half-assed movies
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,The Wild Robot was my favorite book when I was younger. Just the fact this movie exists means so much to me.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,This feels like a literal students animation project got funded majorly and is now being converted into a movie.<br><br>I could not be more happy
The Wild Robot,2024-03-15,"I‚Äôll never forget the first time I read the book version of The Wild Robot in 5th grade.  What was a random book checkout at my school library turned out to be one of the most emotional and heartfelt books I have ever read. This was one of the only books made me cry ugly tears, rooting for Roz and her friends. Now here I am, 5 years later, watching this masterpiece finally being put onto the big screen. Looking at the trailer, I have already teared up knowing that the story that defined my childhood is being passed down to a new generation."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-13,The moving orchestra of &quot;What a wonderful world&quot; combine with the majestic and wholesome imagery made me cry. I love this.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-05,"Knowing the original children&#39;s book as a recent elementary school teacher, I know this is going to hit harder than people realize."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,Never has a movie trailer made me shed tears. This is truly breathtaking.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"How is it possible that I cried over a trailer?! This was very moving, from the selection of music, animation &amp; design, to the mini-story that was revealed to us. Wow. I&#39;m so looking forward to this one. So beautiful to see the engineering marvel that is a robot combined with the beauty of nature."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,...Did a TRAILER just make me CRY?!<br>      This looks amazing. A true work of art. Dreamworks has officially overthrown Pixar.
The Wild Robot,2024-09-13,"&quot;Sometimes, to survive, we must become more than we were programmed to be.&quot;  That&#39;s profound.  It hit me in the heart.  This is going to be relatable."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,"No voice, no speaking, just the sound of nature and a robot, brilliant"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,Peacock: releases Megamind vs The Doom Syndicate<br>Dreamworks: uses this movie as an &quot;apology&quot;
The Wild Robot,2024-03-20,"&quot;Sometimes to survive, we must become more than we were programmed to be.&quot;<br><br>This is the moral message to this upcoming movie. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-08,"Trailer alone looks better than anything Disney has pumped out in the last six years, and i&#39;m so here for it.<br><b>Looks like a tear jerker.</b>"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve felt this much emotion watching an animated movie trailer in a long time! I‚Äôm so excited to see this!
The Wild Robot,2024-03-06,Ok but can we just talk about this cover of the What A Wonderful World? It‚Äôs beautiful
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,"I love everything about this trailer. The large, yet humble scale of it. Accompanied with a harmonious and robotic rendition of ‚ÄúWhat A Wonderful World‚Äù that brings together nature and technology in its purest form. It just brings me to tears. This movie will hopefully bring that magic."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,"Dude, I‚Äôm literally crying.<br>This book was my childhood."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,"It‚Äôs crazy when you think about how far cinema has come with animation and special effects. 30 years ago toy story was the first computer animated full length motion picture, and now you have films like this and the juxtaposition between the two and the amazing things that you see people doing now in cinema is just breathtaking. I really can‚Äôt wait to see this. It looks like it‚Äôs going to be incredible."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,"For those who dont know, this is based off a book series with two parts, called The Wild Robot. And I&#39;ve been waiting for about 4 years for this.<br><br>Edit: Thank you all for telling me about the third book, when I finished book 2, book 3 hadn&#39;t been released yet."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,This looks amazing! A trailer with no corny dialogue. And that robot has more emotion than 90% of characters in movies released last year.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-10,I think we might be looking at the best animated feature of 2024
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"If this doesn&#39;t get nominated for best picture at the Oscars next year, I&#39;ll go into a wild rage. This movie looks so beautiful, and just by watching the trailer, I&#39;m choking up."
The Wild Robot,2024-03-11,This is probably the best trailer I have seen. I‚Äôve never come back to watch a trailer multiple times but this is just so great
The Wild Robot,2024-04-23,Am I the only one who choked up at this commercial? I was in theaters with my 5 year old getting ready to watch KFP4 and this commercial came on.. and I was mesmerized and blown away.. also just very touched. <br><br>I&#39;m very excited for this movie. I&#39;m getting my tear bucket ready üò™üíó
The Wild Robot,2024-03-09,The part at the end where Roz catches Brightbill&#39;s feather is so moving! I never thought I would cry watching a movie trailer.
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"i love the fact that there was no spoken words were in the trailer. i do hope the speech added in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vbA5ZJdKQ&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> was just added flavor to the trailer and that no words will ever be spoken at all, a restriction using the artwork of movies"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-07,"Man I read this book in 5th grade. It was one of the only books in my life that I maintained the attention span to read and enjoy, and probably the only book that I ever truly loved to read. I haven‚Äôt read very many, but to see it all visualized like this after so many years, absolutely magnificent"
The Wild Robot,2024-06-06,"Every time I watch this trailer, I just go silent. I don&#39;t talk, move, and occasionally don&#39;t blink. This movie moves you."
The Wild Robot,2024-06-07,"WHY ARE WE CRYING, THIS IS THE TRAILER?!!! üò≠"
The Wild Robot,2024-03-05,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vbA5ZJdKQ&amp;t=80"">1:20</a> reminds SO MUCH of the Iron Giant. I&#39;m crying"

Venom: The Last Dance,2024-06-03,I never knew that Venom turning into a symbiotic horse was something awesomely I needed.
Venom: The Last Dance,2024-06-03,"Fun fact: Tom Hardy took the role of Eddie Brock/Venom specifically because his son is a big fan. Even more interesting, since Hardy wasn&#39;t that familiar with the character beforehand, his son actually guided him on how to portray Venom!"

Venom: The Last Dance,2024-06-03,"Tom Hardy as Venom is one of those things that&#39;s just an absolute delight and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s got a proper trilogy. Whether or not he ever gets a Deadpool-&amp;-Wolverine-like chance to cross the Spider-Verse and play around in the MCU (which I still DEEPLY hope he does), he&#39;s made these films ridiculously enjoyable and far more memorable than they&#39;d&#39;ve had any right to be otherwise."

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-10,"Smart move to go back to day one, see how it all began. Have so much to work with. I‚Äôm all in. Can‚Äôt wait"
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,I think the novelty alone of seeing these creatures invade on a mass scale is enough for me to go see this
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-08,"Big respect to Lupita. From Juliet on stage to Patsy in 12 Years a Slave, from Us to Black Panther to now this...beautiful woman, great actress."
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-08,Has a bigger budget Cloverfield vibe to it. Has potential!

Which is terrifying.<br><br>Keep in mind the other two movies we always had 1 Death Angels hunting down our characters at a time, with the occasional 2. But this time its potentially Hundreds if not Thousands of them, and that, is horrifying."
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,One of my thoughts watching the first two has always been‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù I want to see what it was like when they first came ‚Äú. Glad we are finally getting that.

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,"Lupita Nyong&#39;o is easily one of the best actress when it comes to the horror genre.

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,"So clearly, it wasn&#39;t just a few here and there, but a whole army. Im also glad that it&#39;s from a different perspective and not the same family from the first two."
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,Look even better than I expected
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME<br>i for realzies feel the urge to actually sit down and pay to watch this in the cinema.<br>today is a happy day

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-08,Best experience I had in the theater was seeing the first movie and it was a packed theater and you could hear someone eating nachos bc it was so quiet in the theater. <br>Looking forward to this movie.
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-12,I WAS soooooooooooooooooooooo hoping for more from this universe! Can&#39;t wait! they could do &quot;Day 1&quot; films for SO MANY places experiencing day 1.

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-11,"The first two were bangers and I absolutely plan on seeing this one, too! The Quiet Place and Don&#39;t Breathe franchises are two of my favorite suspense/thriller franchises to have come out in modern times!"
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,This is like an everlasting movie franchise. It could work with several different other actors/actresses too.
A Quiet Place: Day One,2024-02-07,Lupita and Djimon onscreen together is killer

Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,Mufasa: We were brothers once!<br>Scar: Once‚Ä¶.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,How freaking old is Rafiki? I swear that monkeys been alive for like that whole families bloodline.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,The fact that scar loved mufasa once is heartbreaking
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"I can&#39;t focus on the trailer,I&#39;m just focusing on the fact that Scar sounds like a Victorian British boy that delivers newspapers"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"something about the accents, African lions that studied at Oxford üòÇüòÖ"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,TAKA: BUT I SAVED HIM <br>SCAR: LONG LIVE THE KING

Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-11,&quot; I always wanted a brother&quot; Just makes  mufassa&#39;s fate even sadder and more painful
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"Disney: Let&#39;s make a movie about Mufasa<br>Disney: Let&#39;s make Mufasa an adopted lion, found in a river, with an Oxford accent, and a nut allergy"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-17,Mufasa and Scar&#39;s first scene together: Scar saves Mufasa<br>Mufasa and Scar&#39;s last scene together: Scar kills Mufasa
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,I&#39;m so glad they keep his original name as Taka.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,Taka and Mufasa are basically SG Optimus Prime and Megatron as lions.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-12,Taka: I always wanted a brother. <br>Scar: Be prepared.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-20,Mufasa: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a stray‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>Scar: ‚ÄúBottla Wor‚Äôah!!‚Äù

Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"&quot;Just to be clear, I did not sign up for this!&quot;<br>Zazu speaking for us all."
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,The early dynamic between Taka and Mufasa is giving a hint of Prince of Egypt Rameses and Moses.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"Mufasa: We could‚Äôve still been brothers, no matter what happened<br>Scar: I don‚Äôt think so"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"Taka/Scar: But I saved him!<br>Me: Yeah, and you took it back"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,How funny would it be if they named the white lion Kimba and made him the villain.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,It&#39;s almost begging to be... an animated movie.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-17,"It is impressive how far we have come with technology, cgi, etc-  But 2d animation has more CHARACTER. This would be an even bigger hit as a 2d animated film imo"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,Viewers: What&#39;s live action about the Lion King movie?<br>Disney: The ground.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,&quot;I always wanted a brother&quot; omg üò≠

Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-14,MUFASA: I‚Äôm not a stray. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶.lost
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,i liked the part where the lion said &quot;there will be one Lion King&quot; and then looked directly into the camera. this subtly hints at the fact that this is a lion king movie
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-12,"You know, I feel like this really diminishes the betrayal of Scar to make a movie and be like &quot;oh yeah, they weren&#39;t blood brothers&quot;"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-12,"If you remove the water at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o17MF9vnabg&amp;t=138"">2:18</a>,  it looks like the location Mufasa died. The tree instantly transported me to that scene. Disney out to break my heart all over again."
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,the fact that they released the trailer on world lion&#39;s day...
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-12,Scar: ‚ÄúWe were brothers once!‚Äù <br>Mufasa: ‚ÄúOnce.‚Äù
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,Imagine if lions knew humans were making movies like this about them üòÇ
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-11-17,RIP Sir James Earl Jones. There will only be one Mufasa. One hell of a father.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"The facial expressions make me connect with scar, mufasa and kiara, something the 2019 movie failed to achieve"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,The emotion in the face of the animals was better in this than in the first 2019
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-12,Mufasa: &quot;We were brothers once.&quot;<br>Anakin: &quot;üò†.&quot;
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-13,Taka: I&#39;ve always wanted a brother<br><br>Scar in every other movie: I was supposed to be king
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-11,Zazu never signs up for anything üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-12-05,"If this was in the original animation and not live action cgi, the world would have healed"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-18,"The concept of this story is giving RAMESES AND MOSES. You would think Taka deserved to be a king because he is the real son, but sometimes great leadership doesn‚Äôt come naturally because you‚Äôre born Royal. Taka was meant to be a King but Mufasa deserved to be a King. Taka grew with envy and entitlement and didnt handle rejection and defeat professionally. This movie isnt made to make Mufasa as the bad guy instead we just need to understand The story why Scar had hatred towards Mufasa."
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-11-04,Torn between whether the african lions are Australian or from some suburban rural village of England. What a time to be alive.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-15,"&quot;Mufasa the Usurper.&quot;<br><br>Never thought we&#39;d get that movie, but here we are."

Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-09-09,Rest in peace James Earl Jones. The real Mufasa.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,That &quot;Long live the King&quot; hit from Scar to Simba was really personal. I now see that.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-09-09,"I‚Äôm another who‚Äôs here after the passing of James Earl Jones. R.I.P. to the King of Pride Rock, Mufasa. His voice was the best in Hollywood. A legend who‚Äôll never be forgotten.<br><br>I‚Äôm sure the end credits in some way will dedicate it to being in the Loving Memory of James Earl Jones."
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"Taka looks so kind, courageous and compassionate in this. Hard to believe how he descended into a murderous lion who killed the same lion whom he regarded as a brother since young"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,"Apparently we have to forget this line ever happened: &quot;As far as brains go I got the lions share, but when it comes to brute strength, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m on the shallow end of the gene pool.&quot; Scar and Mufasa are actual blood brothers"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,Does anyone else find it heartbreaking that Scar had once genuinely loved Mufasa as a brother only for certain events of The Lion King to happen?
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies<br><br>Edit- that&#39;s  why it is one of the unforgivable curse in reality
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,I&#39;m getting &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; vibes from the trailer. Adopted brothers who become enemies.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-09-09,"RIP James Earl Jones. Without him, there‚Äôs no Mufasa üíî"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-14,Mufasa: Do not turn your back on me Scar<br><br>Scar: Oh no Mufasa. Perhaps YOU shouldn&#39;t turn your back on me.<br><br>I&#39;ve literally been waiting for over a decade to find the history behind those words.
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stray I‚Äôm just lost‚Äù AH FOR HEAVEN SAKES THAT‚ÄôL DO IT! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-13,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o17MF9vnabg&amp;t=120"">2:00</a> notice how mufasa said ‚Äúim here to protect you my brother‚Äù so he knew scar was gonna be the king and was gonna protect him with his life, this story line will be very interesting"
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-24,Young Scar: I always want to be a king....I mean brother (in a British accent)<br>Old Scar: Long live the king
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-08-10,The relationship between Mufasa and Taka as cubs is so cute ü•∫
Mufasa: The Lion King,2024-09-01,The best part was when Mufasa said &quot;You&#39;re a colourful bunch&quot;.

I was born October 1984 and I&#39;ll be hitting the big 4-0 this year, and I&#39;ll be doing it alongside my most favorite movie!<br><br>Ghostbusters hits something special inside me, its a connection to something special that I hold tender in my heart. As the years go on, and as I age the same way my movie heros do, I&#39;ll still value this connection, and celebrate it in as many ways as I possibly can. Life requires us to be an adult sometimes, but I think it&#39;s obvious what the preference is right? Being a kid at heart can really make the hardships of adult life a lot easier."

Redemption song was written near the end of his life as he convaleced and reflected on his impending death. He understood that his physical death was just that, but such a lover of live, love and freedom still has a hard time letting go. We all do. I have 6 autoimmune disorders and multiple comorbidities. How I am still here and functional is beyond my understanding, but a definite thrill. I have two kids to look after (12 &amp; 17) and would like to remain as long as possible, but, I am also not trying to fight destiny. I‚Äôve been blessed to even be here this long to begin with. Redemption song is one of those songs that gets me through some of those very hard times.üíöüíõ‚ù§üåé one love‚Ä¶"

Red One,2024-09-23,Dwayne Johnson being Dwayne Johnson....<br>The man needs a little Bay back in his life
Red One,2024-06-25,"Two things:<br><br>1) interesting concept and it looks like it‚Äôs trying to start a Live-Action Rise of the Guardians-type of universe like what Violent Night looked to do. <br><br>2) Dwayne Johnson is still basically playing himself but Chris Evans has genuinely been looking like he‚Äôs actually out there now playing characters on a script rather than seeming like he‚Äôs still Captain America. But that‚Äôs only because the man is an actor who has range. From Romantic Comedies such as ‚ÄúNot Another Teen Movie‚Äù, to Drama/Thrillers like ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù and ‚ÄúPush‚Äù, to his more fun roles like ‚ÄúThe Gray Man‚Äù."

Red One,2024-06-26,The movie has no stakes because The Rock can only be punched 3 times and can&quot;t lose.

The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"Boys wake up, new personality just dropped"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,The Oscars need a best Stunt category. They deserve all the love.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,Respect and love to all the stunt people who risk their lives during stunts.
The Fall Guy,2024-05-01,The irony that on this movie Ryan Gosling had  a stunt to do the stunt scenes where he is supposed to be the stunt of the main actor.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-05,"Honestly, a stuntman makes perfect sense as an action hero. It&#39;s almost literally their job."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-06,I love that he kept his word and actually bought the dog a drink. That‚Äôs what I call integrity.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,Only this man can make a film like this genuinely work exactly how he helped make the nice guys work
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"No matter the calibre of film this guy is in, he always steals the show."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,Gosling in a comedic role ALWAYS kills. This guy is a master of humor with a cheat code of infinite charisma!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"This movie is a FINE example that the Oscars really need a Stunt Category segment. <br>David Leitch, Sam Hargrave and Chad Stahelski has truly outdone themselves with The Fall Guy, Extraction 2 and John Wick Chapter 4! <br>All of them started as stuntmen themselves and are now directing one of the best actions moments of modern cinema."
The Fall Guy,2024-03-14,"I used to watch The Fall Guy tv series with Lee Majors as a kid with religious devotion! This looks very, VERY good! I am excited!"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,I love it when Ryan Gosling does physical comedy. No one does it like him. That is why I am excited that he is in a David Leitch movie.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,honestly i saw the title and had like 6 heart attacks thinking this was a fall guys movie
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,Ryan is really good at comedy. We need a sequel to Nice guys!
The Fall Guy,2024-03-07,&quot;Unknown Stuntman&quot; by Lee Majors should play over the end credits or something like that. It is based on the 1981 show after all.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"You can tell David Leitch made this film to really put the spotlight on stunt doubles. Big  energy in this and I love it! Can‚Äôt wait!<br>(Now I‚Äôm being told this is a reboot movie of an 80s show by the same title. Still excited for the movie, though.)"
The Fall Guy,2024-02-08,"I just love the &quot;No, too dangerous, gotta be the stairs&quot; moment. Because of course he would know exactly what kind of fall he can risk taking, he&#39;s a stunt guy, he would know."
The Fall Guy,2024-01-12,this is ryan gosling era
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,I‚Äôm waiting for a stunt double category for the Oscars. They deserve it
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"These type of movies were really missing from Hollywood, glad its making a comeback."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,Ryan Gosling never disappoints.<br><br>Edit: I didn&#39;t say this movie would be a masterpiece or that every movie Ryan was in was a masterpiece..I know he&#39;s done mediocre movies too but here I&#39;m talking about Ryan&#39;s acting and charm so y&#39;all need to chill üíÄ
The Fall Guy,2024-03-08,"One of the best Trailer Edits Of Decades <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw""></a>"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"This is like the one 80s show that is easily transferable and can be done right. The premise works in any decade, stuntman solves mysteries hilarity ensues."
The Fall Guy,2023-12-06,I love that David Leitch just became the guy that makes fun action comedies in hollywood. Really appreciate the guy and his work
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"A live action Fall Guys movie was something we didn‚Äôt ask for, but absolutely need."
The Fall Guy,2024-03-19,This is Ryan Gosling&#39;s time and I&#39;m here for it. üòÅ
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,As someone who works in a hotel.... the key swiping scene is 100000000% accurate
The Fall Guy,2024-01-08,I loved when he said &quot;We arent losers... we are Fall Guys!&quot;
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"Let&#39;s be honest, this man does in a movie everything that all men want to do in our lives."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,It seems like Ryan Gosling is racking up those Ws recently. Going from some of the memorable indie films to commercial blockbusters. <br>And I&#39;m here for it! üòÑ
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,The fact that this was not made by Netflix made me wanna watch this 100%
The Fall Guy,2024-02-12,No one wants to talk about Beach Ken and Kitty Oppenheimer working together?
The Fall Guy,2024-04-14,"If they dont release the music from the trailer, I will riot. That is such a good cover."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,Ryan Gosling Back in His &quot;The Nice Guys&quot; Era.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"He might fall from a tall building, he might roll a brand-new car,<br>&#39;Cause he&#39;s the unknown stuntman that made Diesel such a star."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,A love letter to all of those that risk their lives to bring us action of the highest spectacle<br><br>I cannot wait!
The Fall Guy,2024-03-23,"As long as the ol‚Äô Fall guy GMC truck makes an appearance or two, i‚Äôm on board!!!! Oh, and please release the entire TV series FFS!!!!!!"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"So happy Ryan is now playing more varied and bigger roles getting the recognition he deserves. He&#39;s such a humble and talented actor.<br><br>Edit: obviously talking about big action blockbuster roles, to anyone coming to insult me for no reason."
The Fall Guy,2024-02-11,Heather Thomas was on my wall as a kid. I met them at the car show in 1984. They were right next to the cast of The Dukes of Hazzard.  Two of the best shows ever.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"Drive 2 is looking great. His character got so much better at conversing with people, I&#39;m proud of the glow up."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,&quot;They wanted to kill me and not in the fun way&quot;<br><br>That killed me!!!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,I&#39;m so glad Fall Guys is finally getting a movie. So deserved
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"The cool thing about this concept is that for every action sequence in the trailer, we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just Ryan Gosling&#39;s character filming a movie scene, or if it&#39;s actual action on his quest to solve the mystery. Great stuff for a trailer."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,I LOVED The Fall Guy as an 80&#39;s kid. I never imagined a movie of it with way more action and comedy. Ha. I&#39;m down.
The Fall Guy,2023-12-30,"Ryan Gosling is a terrific actor, he&#39;s been doing some real cool stuff lately"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"Honestly, I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s taken them this long to adapt this to the big screen. Stuntmen are sort of real life action figures as it is since they often have to do all the fight coordination &amp; take a lot of bumps so the idea of one as a diehard hero type seems obvious"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-06,No one beats Lee Majors as the Fall Guy. Fantastic 80&#39;s show.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-25,I&#39;m so grateful to be chosen to star in this cinematic masterpiece!‚ù§
The Fall Guy,2024-04-30,"Lee Majors,  85 y/o, and Heather Thomas, both make a cameo appearance in this film as cops. Can&#39;t wait to see this movie, looks like a lot of fun. Always loved the Fall Guy."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"Glad to know Lee Majors will appear in the film, regardless of how small a role, knowing Lee&#39;s in it made the difference for me as to see this film or not."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-22,I love how this trailer gives us just enough to get excited without giving away the whole plot. Well done üòçüòçüòç
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,I&#39;ve never physically smiled with my whole body and soul at a trailer in a long time!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"I&#39;m all in, great homage to all the stunt people out there and also Lee Majors who was the OG Fall Guy back in the day."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,This is why Ryan Gosling is a badass
The Fall Guy,2023-11-05,Finally stunt man will get some recognition and they totally deserve it because they take lot of risks in their life ‚ù§Ô∏è
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,Hannah Waddingham on her way to steal the show yet again üëèüèªüëèüèª And Emily and Ryan&#39;s chemistry is SO much fun!!!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,Okay. this actually looks good.<br><br>a great movie that puts the stunt men on full force... now WE need a stun category for these amazing gutsy people
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,My 10 year old self just screamed with joy.    Nice!   Glad it‚Äôs a movie and not a series.    I absolutely loved the adventures of Colt Seavers and wished there were more series but this will do nicely.
The Fall Guy,2024-05-02,"Finally a movie I want to see. How can you go wrong with comedy, action for the guys and a little romance for the girls."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,I used to love the Fall Guy as a kid. I sure hope a modern rendition of his truck makes it into the movie!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-30,They better have The Fall Guy Theme at some point in the movie and Lee Majors better have a cameo!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,Never thought i would see them two in a movie together.  Im excited just for that reason alone.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"Perfectly cast with Ryan and Emily. I would love to see a 5 minute cameo with Lee Majors from the original Fall Guy series somewhere in the movie, where the title idea came from. The writers used a few ideas of the series, the big truck jumping, the name Jodi in the movie, the cowboy hat, and sheer humor of being a fall guy with lots of action, having fist fights a lot. Yeah, I know there is a lot different from a show decades ago too. Ryan and Emily, 2 very bankable stars these days!"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,Emily:  You look terrible<br>Ryan:  You look amazing<br>Sometimes great writing does not need to be fancy.  Really looking forward to this one
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,"&quot;I&#39;m the unknown stuntman, that makes Eastwood look so fine&quot;. Loved this show as a kid. Ryan is great for it too. Definitely will check it out."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-04,I‚Äôm so happy to see an actual movie not made by Netflix or Amazon üòÇthis looks so good!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-08,The production value on this trailer is phenomenal
The Fall Guy,2023-11-06,Salute to all the stunt people dead or alive; the ones who truly bring our favorite characters to life
The Fall Guy,2024-01-24,love it when he said &quot;it&#39;s fallin&#39; time&quot;
The Fall Guy,2023-11-07,"As a fan of Lee Majors in the TV show, I honestly didn&#39;t think Ryan Gosling could pull it off.  I have restored hope in his efforts."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"&quot;I might jump from a tall building, I might roll a brand new car&quot;"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"Good to see stunt doubles getting the recognition they deserve, the movie looks fun so far.<br>That being said‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs literally me"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,"Between Drive and The Fall Guy, Ryan Gosling really loves playing stuntmen."
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,"Having seen this filmed here in Sydney, I‚Äôm excited to see how all the different shots around our city come together as part of the finished movie! Can‚Äôt wait for the film to hit theaters next year!"
The Fall Guy,2024-03-14,Ryan Gosling rocks. A full talented man
The Fall Guy,2023-12-10,Hats off the the stuntman of Ryan Gosling actually!
The Fall Guy,2023-12-31,Make Ryan Gosling our mcu Ghost Rider üíÄüî•
The Fall Guy,2023-12-29,Imagine Hollywood coming up with an original iconic franchise for a change. Just imagine.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-08,"I like when he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fall guys time‚Äù and proceeded fall all over the guys"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-07,"The best line of the year, says gorgeous stuntman to his dog: &quot;Engage your core.&quot;"
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,Finally a big budget action movie to be released in theaters and not on a streaming service. Can‚Äôt wait to see The Fall Guy.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,This looks like a fun and entertaining movie. Gosling and Blunt always deliver in their performances.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-03,I cant wait! I loved the Fall Guy TV series! RG is going to kill it in this role!
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,This looks like a movie Ryan Reynolds would do.
The Fall Guy,2023-11-02,They&#39;re making a Fall Guy movie at last? Alright. I hope Lee Majors is still alive. The man needs to have a cameo in this piece.
Wonka,2023-07-11,Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Wonka,2023-07-11,"i&#39;m a simple man, i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming, i put this on the must watch list."
Wonka,2023-07-13,"When I was a child the original Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite movie. I would watch it every day multiple times a day and make my whole family watch with me. Most of my family got tired of me asking them to rewatch it for the 100th time but my grandma never did. She always watched it with me, sung the songs, and rehearsed the lines with me. she never got tired of it. Earlier this year she passed away and I wish I could see this with her but when it comes out I will go see it in honor of her with a empty seat next to me just for her.<br><br>Edit: I didn‚Äôt mean the one with Johnny Depp I meant the original movie with Gene Wilder just forgot it was named Willy wonka and the chocolate factory instead of Charlie and the chocolate factory."
Wonka,2024-02-21,"&quot;Every good thing in this world started with a dream, so you hold on to yours.&quot; This really touched me."
Wonka,2023-07-11,To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Wonka,2023-07-14,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get to see an third installment of Wonka in my lifetime. I‚Äôm 72 years old and I will be watching this film at the theaters!
Wonka,2023-07-11,"&quot;From the Director of Paddington&quot; I&#39;m sold, those movies are cinematic masterpieces"
Wonka,2024-04-11,I didn&#39;t know Paul Atreides made chocolate
Wonka,2023-07-14,"Every character I&#39;ve seen Timoth√©e Chalamet play is usually soft-spoken and reserved ... so it&#39;s kind of odd to see him in an energetic role like this. At the end of the day, though? It looks like a cute, lighthearted, family-friendly flick that people&#39;ll take their kids to during the holidays. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it ended up doing really well..."
Wonka,2023-07-12,"The simple fact that this is directed by the guy who did the two Paddington movies is enough to get me to watch this. Those films were absolute masterpieces of performances, storytelling and direction."
Wonka,2024-03-01,My favorite scene in this movie is when Willy fights &quot;The Unknown&quot; and sucks him into a vacuum.
Wonka,2023-07-14,Honestly it&#39;s nice to see a heartwarming movie coming to theaters for a change. I feel like the cast and crew had a lot of fun with Wonka
Wonka,2023-07-24,I love how this is 100% a Christmas movie without being about actual Christmas. The outfits and whole aesthetic. Christmas was definitely the vibe they where going for!
Wonka,2024-03-31,Was expecting a Johnny Depp take on Willy Wonka but Chalamet nailed it. I know people thinking he&#39;s overrated but what an actor!
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Okay, good to know this is a film that knows it is goofy and silly, but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun. Not to mention the cast looks incredible, and the director has never actually made a bad film, so I got a good feeling about this one."
Wonka,2023-07-12,A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea.
Wonka,2023-07-11,Something I never thought I wanna see: a Willy Wonka prequel!
Wonka,2024-03-22,My favorite part is when Wonka added a little too much spice and started dreaming about leading a group of desert folks to paradise üëç
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Even if it&#39;s minor role, it&#39;s always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can&#39;t wait to see this one, the film captures the spirit of the source material so well ‚ù§"
Wonka,2023-07-20,"Love the ending, when he says &quot;the true wonka were the friends we made along the way&quot;"
Wonka,2024-02-22,Honestly this is a good movie even when others seem to dislike it. It‚Äôs cute and it explains the way he is in the original and why he acts the way he does towards Charlie
Wonka,2023-07-11,Directed and written by the man who made paddington? It&#39;s gonna be a masterpiece.
Wonka,2023-07-11,This looks like a real festive movie. We&#39;ve not had one of those in years.
Wonka,2023-07-11,the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Wonka,2024-07-24,"Wonka was absolutely phenomenal! The story, music, songs, cinematography, beautiful colorful sets, everything was top notch. Perfectly captured the magic of the Roald Dahl books.  Timoth√©e Chalamet stole the show as Willy Wonka. One of the best feel good movies I have seen in a long time. üç´üëèüëèüëè"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Beae, and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film, means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel. RIP Gene Wilder."
Wonka,2023-07-25,"I loved it when he said &quot;It&#39;s Wonking Time&quot; and Wonked all over the screen, one of the movie moments of all time."
Wonka,2023-07-11,If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then there&#39;s no stopping him.<br>You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka.
Wonka,2024-01-24,"I cried at the end, not because of a happy ending, but because I&#39;ve been watching Willy Wonka movie about aa hundred times and this sequel reminded me of my childhood"
Wonka,2023-07-12,"I love how Timothee Chalamet is paying homage to both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder when it comes to his take on Willy Wonka. So excited to see his full version of wonka, based on what I see in this trailer, he already is amazing!!!"
Wonka,2023-07-16,"I love how they harmonized (reprised) the ‚Äúin the world of pure imagination‚Äù in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=90"">1:30</a>"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary. But I gotta admit, this looks quite good. And Timothee is very talented!"
Wonka,2024-04-03,"Whoever knows Timoth√®e Chalamet, raise your hand because I do"
Wonka,2023-07-21,Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over. Thank you Roald Dahl.
Wonka,2023-08-16,"On the one hand, it looks whimsical and lovely for a Christmas movie. On the other, and I might be the cheese that stands alone, I feel like Chalamet is not weird enough for the role - his lines fall flat to me. I love Chalamet so hoping the movie will change my mind. I&#39;ll watch if only for Grant as a oompa loompa, what genius casting!"
Wonka,2023-07-13,‚ÄúDiscover how Willy became Wonka‚Äù is my new favorite line now.
Wonka,2024-12-03,Calah Lane carried the movie.  She was brilliant.  Didn‚Äôt realize she was 15.  She was perfect.  So talented.
Wonka,2023-07-11,I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
Wonka,2023-07-11,"This movie looks absolutely magical, I never knew I needed a willy wonka prequel but this looks like it‚Äôs gonna be a wonderful watch. can‚Äôt wait!"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Willy Wonka is actually selling his weird stuff and not just his chocolate bars. Respect to WB for going in a new direction rather than just the &quot;I need a replacement for my chocolate factory&quot; also I enjoyed the Harry Potter vibe from the setting, Wonka may not have been magical but his candy sure seems to be."
Wonka,2024-03-13,Timoth√©e Chalamet as Wonka is the most graceful thing to exist ‚ù§
Wonka,2023-07-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> Always love an &quot;epic&quot; version of a classic theme tune, even if I&#39;ve only heard it about twice in my life."
Wonka,2023-07-11,Hughmpa Loompa is my new favorite thing
Wonka,2023-07-11,"I was always wondering how a prequel to willy wonka, describing his origin, would be like. Now, after seeing this, I am fully onboard now. This looks absolutely amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see this in theaters."
Wonka,2023-07-12,"honestly im very much surprised of how amazing this looks. it feels so magical and like such a wholesome movie, and its not a remake!! its a non canon prequel of one of the most magical and mysterious characters of lots of peoples childhoods (and its timothee chalamet, which i adore with all my heart hes so adorable)"
Wonka,2023-07-12,"As fascinating as this movie looks, I&#39;m kinda sad that we&#39;ll likely never get a &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot; movie. I remember reading that book in school immediately after finishing &quot;the Chocolate Factory&quot; and had always wondered how it could be as a movie"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"didn‚Äôt really think this was gonna be anything but this has captured the Roald Dahl vibe better than anything else I‚Äôve seen since the original Chocolate Factory, plus its directed by the Paddington guy"
Wonka,2024-12-01,"Could you imagine,. Getting up,.. and driving ,..and paying to watch this?,.lol~"
Wonka,2023-09-07,I love all these 100% original and not shamelessly rehashed movies being put out these days
Wonka,2023-07-12,So happy for you Daniel Thrasher! How cool!
Wonka,2023-08-12,When he says ‚Äúwith great chocolate comes great responsibility‚Äù gave me chillbumps
Wonka,2024-06-12,The ending made me so emotional. Realizing why sharing a special moment with someone was so important and having them there in spirit when he accomplished his goals was heart breaking and beautiful. This was like closure to my childhood even if I am an adult now.
Wonka,2023-07-11,"You know its gonna be good, when just the trailer puts a smile on your face."
Wonka,2023-07-12,"Okay, I haven&#39;t seen that many Timothee Chalamet movies, but he seems to smile a lot more here. It&#39;s good to see him expand his acting range. Looking forward to this movie."
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Love the how they use ‚Äúpure imagination‚Äù in this, the inspiration is lovely"
Wonka,2024-01-30,A prequel that we didn‚Äôt want but we loved ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wonka,2023-07-11,"I&#39;m a fairly cynical person when it comes to reboots etc, but this actually has a really fun, sincere, festive vibe. Seems like it will be a good time"
Wonka,2023-07-11,This shows that Timothee is really growing as an actor. I&#39;m actually proud of him.
Wonka,2023-07-11,Yes another Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory movie!! This was my favorite childhood movie.<br><br>Lots of likes!
Wonka,2024-04-29,&quot;Power over chocolate is power over all.&quot;
Wonka,2023-10-14,Only thing weird is how they took this in a more magical direction. Even adult Wonka hadn&#39;t perfected Fizzy lifting drink and all of his inventions had strange side effects. This younger Wonka seems too perfect.
Wonka,2023-07-11,I cant&#39;t wait! The cast is insane! My jaw was on the floor throughout the video. Timothee has an extraordinary career going on.
Wonka,2023-07-12,I love how whimsical it is. Very true to the feel of the original and I have faith in the Director of Paddington to create a masterpiece.
Wonka,2024-04-30,Timothee Chalamet literally have his own Barbenheimer LMAO
Wonka,2023-07-11,Timothee proves himself once again to be a versatile actor that has so much to offer. <br><br>He‚Äôs not this generation‚Äôs Johnny Deep or Leo. <br><br>He‚Äôs the one and only Timothee Chalamet!
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Everyone wait hold on is that from mr bean? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=101"">1:41</a>"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Remember seeing the original as a little kid when it first came out in theaters. Seen it countless times since.  I begrudgingly ended up enjoying Tim Burton&#39;s version, particularly Danny Elfman&#39;s music.  This one also looks promising.  Should do well, I think."
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Man that scene where willy said &quot;It&#39;s wonking time&quot; and chocolated everyone in the room,, cinema right there."
Wonka,2023-07-11,"The magic, the vibes, the music. It‚Äôs all so wonderful. Def won‚Äôt be skipping this one"
Wonka,2023-08-03,I love the part where Timothee said &quot;it&#39;s wonking time.&quot; Really a movie of many generations and timely accurate depictions.
Wonka,2024-01-28,I called my wife an Oompa Loompa she won&#39;t talk to me now
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Rowan Atkinson&#39;s appearance alone is enough to let me know that this movie is gonna be great, and of course our boy Timothy will amaze us with his performance‚ú®Ô∏è"
Wonka,2023-07-12,"Chalamet‚Äôs take feels a lot like Gene Wilder‚Äôs Wonka before he became jaded, bitter, and worn down. I like it."
Wonka,2023-07-12,"Wow this looks amazing! People were talking like it was going to be dark and gritty, instead it&#39;s whimsical, with dance numbers! This trailer totally changed my opinion on this movie. I can&#39;t wait to see it."
Wonka,2024-08-13,"Wonka has been by far my favorite movie of all time. The first time I watched this in the theatre, I already knew this movie was gonna be my favorite."
Wonka,2023-07-13,Charlie and the chocolate factory + Mr Bean = Perfect combo to re-live my childhood memories üòçüòçüòç
Wonka,2023-07-11,"What a legendary cast! When you see Matthew Baynton from Horrible Histories, you know this movie‚Äôs going to be a classic."
Wonka,2023-07-13,"‚ÄúSo shines a good deed in a weary world‚Äù - Willy Wonka (1971). They‚Äôre bringing the spirit of the first film back, and I‚Äôm totally on board."
Wonka,2024-04-15,Timothee in December: Make a wish.......<br>Timothee in the next year March: Long live the fighters!!!!!!!!!
Wonka,2023-07-11,Timoth√©e Chalamet is a phenomenal actor. I hope they show a devastated and torn side of him to keep the audience from thinking this is only a whimsical story
Wonka,2023-07-11,"It looks incredible, can&#39;t wait to see Timoth√©e in a very different role !"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"The Paddington production team and Chalamet sounds like a recipe for success right here, especially for the latter as Dune, Part 2 is also guaranteed to be a success!"
Wonka,2023-07-11,I loved it when Wonka said &quot;With great chocolate comes great responsibility&quot; truly the most movie moment ever made
Wonka,2023-07-12,"The opportunity to see Timmy dancing and singing already had me sold on the<br> movie, but this makes it look even more amazing than I&#39;d imagined."
Wonka,2023-07-11,"Honestly I love how endearing and comfortable Timothee is in the role. It&#39;s like he amplifies the &quot;feel-good&quot; and whimsical tones of the film really well. I also like how they showed us that Willy Wonka struggles, without shoving it down our throats. Can&#39;t wait for this"
Wonka,2024-04-09,This movie is a mix of sadness and happiness its a feeling i cant explain
Wonka,2023-07-14,"I think this actually looks rather fun and I trust the makers of Paddington implicitly to handle this with care and integrity. That being said, this does feed even more into the idea that Hollywood is absolutely bankrupt of original ideas and creativity."
Wonka,2023-07-11,I love the part when he said it‚Äôs wonking time. Sent chills down my spine
Wonka,2023-07-11,With how fascinating Willy Wonka&#39;s backstory was in the movie I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s taken 50 years to make a movie about it. Very much looking forward to seeing this!

Wonka,2023-07-11,I really miss these types of wholesome movies Hollywood used to make back then so much and I hope the Wonka movie don&#39;t disappoint üòä.
Wonka,2023-07-11,"I still think Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka but may he rest in peace, I&#39;ll give this movie a chance"
Wonka,2023-07-11,"That cast is stacked!!! Also, this has a magical vibe compared to the Tim Burton version that has a tinge of eeriness to it which is good too."
Wonka,2024-04-01,"This was a great movie, I loved Huge Grant as the Oompa Loompa, Roland Atkinson as the clergyman was an unexpected surprise, and Timothee Chalamet (even though I never heard of him) did a fantastic job as Willy Wonka, he really made the character his own. <br><br>A very cool origin story<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed it, great visuals, acting, story, and soundtrack. You really got a visceral example of capitalism, greed, corruption, redemption, and justice. <br><br>This stands alongside the 1971 original well."
Wonka,2023-07-11,&quot;Everything good in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours.&quot; So beautiful. This movie will be magical üíñ
Wonka,2023-07-11,Timothy really has been killing it these past few years
Wonka,2023-07-12,"Director of Paddington, solid cast, definitely seems like it‚Äôs going for the vibe of Roald Dahl‚Äôs books. Honestly I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about this"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,Now this is how you make a trailer that&#39;s full of movie clips but doesn&#39;t give the story away.
Longlegs,2024-05-21,The decision to never actually show Nicolas Cage in the trailer but only using his bone-chilling voice is absolutely intriguing... The most mesmerizing horror trailer I&#39;ve seen since Hereditary
Longlegs,2024-05-22,"No matter how the movie is, this trailer should be taught in film and schools, because it is as impactful as the original Alien trailer was. New, great sound design with great edits, showing off a mood but not spoiling anything from the story and also hiding stuff for those who want to look closer. Absolutely stellar."
Longlegs,2024-05-20,sound design going crazy
Longlegs,2024-06-30,"Nicolas cage is having one of the best comebacks we‚Äôve seen, it all started with Mandy that movie is incredible"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,This might be the best marketing for a horror film since the original Blair Witch Project. This is how you generate excitement for your film!
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"The marketing has been incredible, no spoilers any of the trailers."
Longlegs,2024-05-20,Damn that‚Äôs a good trailer. The marketing people behind this are next level.
Longlegs,2024-05-31,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE&amp;t=45"">0:45</a> Gotta be one of the craziest sounds I‚Äôve ever heard , literally tickles that weird dark part of my ears and brain"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"love how this trailer gives almost nothing away, can‚Äôt wait to see it in theaters"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,The &quot;who&#39;s watching this opening night button!&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Longlegs,2024-06-12,"I have seen over 100 Nicolas Cage films and he has NEVER played a character like this. Utterly bone chilling, I love it"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,ending cypher decoded: &quot;SAYYOURPRAYERS&quot;
Longlegs,2024-06-15,‚ÄúHow many times have you rewatched this?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù
Longlegs,2024-06-11,Someone that finally knows how to make a good trailer. Took a hundred years.
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"Gotta say, whoever is leading the marketing for Longlegs has done a great job. Even with this longer trailer, there is still a lot of mystery behind what‚Äôs really going on. Definitely planning to watch this. Looks to be following in the vein of Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and True Detective in regards to atmosphere and feel."
Longlegs,2024-05-21,This is one of the best trailers I have seen in years and the promotion so far for this film is beyond epic.    I am seriously thinking this is gonna be this era&#39;s silence of the lambs.
Longlegs,2024-05-27,"The sound design at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> is absolutely beautiful and terrifying"
Longlegs,2024-05-21,Maika has grown to be my fave Scream Queen of all time. This trailer looks so promising. Cannot wait.
Longlegs,2024-05-20,This is gonna be the best horror movie of 2024. I&#39;m calling it right now. <br>I mean after all those eerie teasers and now THIS. Man this trailer freaks me out.
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"Between this and the Eggers Nosferatu remake, we might be getting all time horror movies this year"
Longlegs,2024-06-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE&amp;t=47"">0:47</a> is like a moment out of a nightmare--the kind that you wake up from in a cold sweat and feel throughout the whole day. I can&#39;t wait for this movie."
Longlegs,2024-05-28,"This may be one of the best trailers I&#39;ve e ever seen. The sounds, the lack of un-needed music. The darkenss. So damn good."
Longlegs,2024-05-22,"Did not notice the eyes and face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> at first and on my second watch it scared tf out of me. Amazing stuff."
Longlegs,2024-07-10,First horror trailer that‚Äôs genuinely got me excited in years.
Longlegs,2024-05-21,NEON &amp; A24 like brother and sister üî•üî•üî•
Longlegs,2024-06-18,The sound guys did absolutely phenomenal job.
Longlegs,2024-05-31,"Now this is an amazing horror movie trailer <br>Gives zero plot away but shows enough clips and awesome sounds, voice over to make the audience beg for more"
Longlegs,2024-07-01,"Whoever did the sound design on this trailer should get a raise. Holy shit, it&#39;s done so well with the dark industrial melodies throughout the Trailer. It adds a whole &#39;nother layer to an already awesome trailer."
Longlegs,2024-05-20,WHEN I TELL YOU I RAN HERE SO FAST‚Äì
Longlegs,2024-05-22,"This, Hollywood, this is how you make a trailer!"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,Been a while since I felt so tense watching just a trailer... definitely going to watch this. The sound design was &lt;chefs kiss&gt;
Longlegs,2024-05-20,Crazy spooky Nic Cage movie I am seated immediately!
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"Great trailer, I love when they don&#39;t show you too much but leave you wanting more. Im in"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,This and Cuckoo better be my top 2 of the year üôå Neon is on a roll with horror films this year üëè
Longlegs,2024-05-20,this my most anticipated movie this year
Longlegs,2024-06-27,"I love the ambiguity of the trailer!!!! Looks like a horror story that&#39;s brand new, no spoilers in the trailer, doesn&#39;t give away who Longlegs really is. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Longlegs,2024-05-24,This probably the first trailer I‚Äôve ever seen that put fear in me. I think it was because the first time I watched was unintentional and I wasn‚Äôt prepared; it came up as an ad while I was watching another video and after about ten seconds I had to finish it. Fingers crossed it lives up to the trailer
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE&amp;t=137"">2:17</a> Freeze frame &quot;Say your prayers&quot;"
Longlegs,2024-05-22,This is one of my most anticipated movies in several years. Oz Perkin is a goated horror director and the casting on the leads in this couldn&#39;t be more perfect.
Longlegs,2024-06-08,This is it folks. This is gonna be the best horror movie of the year
Longlegs,2024-06-13,this trailer editing company deserves all the love and recognition
Longlegs,2024-05-20,One of the best trailers i&#39;ve seen in a long while. So ready for this.
Longlegs,2024-06-28,"It&#39;s been a long time since a horror trailer has made me emotional. Not due to the subject matter, but how well it&#39;s executed. I am so indescribably excited to see this, horror is overtaking all other genres imo."
Longlegs,2024-05-20,One of the most anticipated movies!!! Amazing trailer also!!

Longlegs,2024-05-23,"One of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen. I hope it as good as it looks to be and lives up to the hype, but based on what has been shown so far, can‚Äôt imagine that it doesn‚Äôt"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,Sweet. The transitions go crazy. Love the different lens used and the use of 4 by 4 and widescreen too.<br>Very chilling music too and the atmosphere really sells it. Love the different camera angles and the color of black and yellow being used here
Longlegs,2024-06-29,"what incredible trailer. doesn&#39;t overshare the film&#39;s content yet doesn&#39;t strip it down too much. just a perfectly edited trailer of suspense and tension. i&#39;m very, very interested in watching this now!"
Longlegs,2024-05-20,This movie looks so amazingly good
Longlegs,2024-06-13,This is so good. I have watched the trailer like 15 times by now. So original and crazy scary!!!
Longlegs,2024-06-08,"She is one of the BEST female actresses, and is highly underrated. üî• Maika Monroe ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Longlegs,2024-05-21,"I do want to say this again, but this is the best way of making trailers for a horror movie. This trailer is terrifying with the sound design like kudos to the sound designer. This trailer is not giving anything away and is very intriguing and creepy. Also they‚Äôre not showing Nicolas Cage‚Äôs full face again in this trailer and from other trailers so he has to be looking insane and unsettling when we see him in theatres."
Longlegs,2024-06-15,"Rare case of a movie that actually looks good, I hope it lives up to the trailer."
Longlegs,2024-05-20,"Oooohhh this looks sooo good!<br><br>Been one of my most anticipated films of the year, and this trailer is crazy good!"
Longlegs,2024-05-22,"I&#39;ve been waiting for this film for a long time, and I have very high  hopes for it. Please don&#39;t disappoint."
Longlegs,2024-06-19,"So happy to see this main actress again, she is very underated."
Longlegs,2024-05-21,Alan wake 2 and I AM SO HERE FOR IT
Longlegs,2024-06-08,The amount of hype I have for this movie is insane.
Longlegs,2024-06-07,"NOW THIS IS HOW YOU DO A MOVIE TRAILER!<br><b>ESPECIALLY A HORRER MOVIE TRAILER!</b><br><br><br>This left me with nothing but questions &amp; more questions and intrigue.<br>The &quot;monster is never truly shown(as it shouldn&#39;t), they don&#39;t give away the plot nor the scares in general."
Longlegs,2024-06-30,Heard it‚Äôs 100% on rotten tomatoes and it‚Äôs on the most disturbing movies in recent years. I‚Äôm in
Longlegs,2024-05-29,Nicolas Cage is a very versatile actor. There‚Äôs no role he can‚Äôt play.
Longlegs,2024-05-21,Man I can‚Äôt wait for this one watched all the teasers and trailer so far getting me more hyped every time
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"It is truly insane to make a trailer and not once acknowledge its a full blown musical, absolutely wild behaviour"
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"I‚Äôm surprised the trailer doesn‚Äôt feature any aspect of this being a musical, since u know, that‚Äôs the main difference in this version"
Mean Girls,2023-11-16,"No Mean Girls movie can replace the Mean Girls 2004. It was, is, and will be a classic. Period."
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"If I wanted to watch mean girls again, I would just watch mean girls . It still holds up"
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,&quot;This isn&#39;t your Mom&#39;s Mean girls&quot; They had no need to do 30yo&#39;s women that dirty üò≠üò≠üò≠
Mean Girls,2023-11-29,I feel bad for this cast. You can‚Äôt capture lightning in a bottle twice. The original cast was perfect.
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"i mean this is basically based off the musical, but yeah nothing can&#39;t beat the OG Mean girls movie from 2004"
Mean Girls,2024-01-10,Tina Fey has aged incredibly well. She basically looks exactly the same as she did 20 years ago.
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"Kind of disappointed they didn‚Äôt showcase the musical part of this movie on the trailer. I mean it‚Äôs literally a musical adaptation of Mean Girls, right?"
Mean Girls,2023-11-17,The orginal casts as parents having a fued and wanting their children to win prom queen would‚Äôve been beautiful üò≠
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,"Hollywood felt they needed to make a Gen Z version of every 80s, 90s and 2000 movie."
Mean Girls,2023-12-19,"Can we PLEASE get a sequel with ALL the original actors from 2004 all grown up?!?!!!<br>We‚Äôve been waiting for like, ever!"
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"For a musical adaptation you would think there would me, you know, more musical adapting..."
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,A movie adaptation of a musical adaptation of a movie adaptation of a book. So this new movie just needs to be adapted into a book to bring it everything full circle.
Mean Girls,2023-11-18,How is Tina Fey aging in reverse?!
Mean Girls,2023-11-13,"The Walmart add gave more. Literally, the original Mean Girls as moms? Now THAT was lore galore and a second movie worth making!"
Mean Girls,2023-12-07,We dont need a fricking remake of everything. Hollywood is creatively bankrupt.
Mean Girls,2023-11-13,I like how the French teacher is the Gretchen from the musical
Mean Girls,2024-01-09,&quot;Not your mom&#39;s Mean Girls&quot; hit me in the gut.
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,"Mean Girls is iconic! One of my all-time favorites! I love that the principal and Tina Fey are both back in this one, too. But I&#39;m not big on musicals. And this is really just going to be a repeat with added music in it. Nothing will ever surpass the 2004 version."
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,how can you make a trailer for the mean girls musical without a single song from the musical üò≠üò≠üò≠
Mean Girls,2023-11-09,"Nond of these actors give off an iconic vibe, even the main characters"
Mean Girls,2023-12-28,The original is one of the only movies I can watch over and over again... It&#39;s gonna be tough to match.
Mean Girls,2023-11-23,Renee rapp is so insanely talented! Weird that they didn‚Äôt mention that it‚Äôs a musical‚Ä¶is it still? I‚Äôm lost lol
Mean Girls,2024-01-09,I can&#39;t quite place what it is but there is something about this that will NEVER beat The origanal Mean Girls. Its too iconic ig<br>edit: ik 1k isnt that much but its the most likes ive ever gotten thx so much
Mean Girls,2024-01-05,No matter how much they recreate it&#39;ll never be able to replace the legendary film
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,"This movie did not need to be remade. It&#39;s literally timeless and iconic. Some things should be treated like Mariah Carey&#39;s &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot;, untouched."
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,I was so surprised to see Pierson <b>AND</b> Christopher Briney both in the trailer
Mean Girls,2023-12-02,&quot;This looks great!&quot; - No One
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"Before anyone went nuts, this is a musical adaptation of the Broadway show. Not a remake of the original movie, they aren&#39;t trying to beat the original movie when they&#39;re doing a different approach similar to last year&#39;s Matilda and the new Color Purple movie. Heck even Tina Fey wrote the screenplay for this movie as she was also heavily involved in the Broadway show"
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,Did... did they forget to market this as a musical? When that&#39;s the whole point? People are going to think this is just a remake of the 2004 movie
Mean Girls,2024-01-06,"The original may have come out almost 20 years ago, but it holds up so well. Feels like it came out in the mid 2010‚Äôs."
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,LITTERALLY the Walmart vertion of<br>Mean girls lol
Mean Girls,2023-11-13,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtdbEgnUOk&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> Pierson Wodzynski - Youtuber"
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,There is nothing they could do to beat the original movie. This is almost an insult to our nostalgia
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,Nothing can touch the original. I watched it AGAIN 2 days ago and still so funny.
Mean Girls,2023-11-15,I have a feeling this is another case of &quot;Why are they remaking another classic that doesn&#39;t have to be remade?&quot;
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,Honestly it feels like a gen z  nightmare. Still I&#39;m hoping that this movie does well and gains a loyal following of its own.
Mean Girls,2023-11-15,"I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a remake or an adaptation of the musical broadway. You don&#39;t reinvent what the original succeeded in. <br><br>The original is bound to be a teen classic, it&#39;s relatable, the characters are funny and darn right Quotable. <br><br>This version won&#39;t surpass what the original did."
Mean Girls,2023-12-29,I&#39;m still watching to see that guy say the most iconic line ever: &quot;She doesn&#39;t even go here!&quot;
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"For those of you who don‚Äôt know, this is not a remake of the original movie. Rather, it is an adaptation of the broadway musical based on the original 2004 movie, in a similar vain to the Matilda The Musical movie or the new The Color Purple."
Mean Girls,2024-01-01,Can we just leave iconic classics alone! The original is still completely relevant
Mean Girls,2023-11-14,I feel like the OG Mean Girls is too iconic to try to redo ALREADY.
Mean Girls,2023-11-30,Why change something that&#39;s not even broken! Mean Girls 2004 will live forever!
Mean Girls,2023-11-09,Why they changed the line  when Damian and Janis see Cady eating lunch in the bathroom &quot;It&#39;s either you&#39;re there doing drugs or very constipated from doing drugs&quot; That was one of funniest line in the musical
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,"‚ÄúNoooo you don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs not a reboot of the movie, it‚Äôs a film adaptation of the musical based on the movie. It‚Äôs gonna be totally different. please buy a ticket and watch the movie that you‚Äôve already watched made by the same people who made the last one. JUST GIVE US YOUR MONEY‚Äù"
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,so happy to see Ashely park here. hope she will have a singing part.
Mean Girls,2023-11-19,who tf casted these people
Mean Girls,2023-11-13,Yeah....we didn&#39;t need another one; the first is timelessly perfect.
Mean Girls,2023-11-19,"I swear Hollywood is running out of creativity, hence so many remakes are coming out"
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,This is like the Walmart version of mean girls üíÄ
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,I love how Ashley Park is the French teacher!!!
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,"Pierson at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtdbEgnUOk&amp;t=101"">1:41</a> ,You‚Äôre Welcome"
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,"oh if i hadn&#39;t read the comments section, i would NOT have known that this is going to be a musical version of the movie lol"
Mean Girls,2023-12-05,Dude who even casted this actress (if she&#39;s even one) as REGINA EFFING GEORGE like...
Mean Girls,2023-11-10,I feel like they‚Äôre trying too hard to be modern in this movie when the original still holds up really well
Mean Girls,2023-11-12,"I still remember in 5th grade 2004, it came out and was so mad my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me go with my friends. Will always be iconic"
Mean Girls,2023-11-09,When you run out off ideas. Hollywood has lost all originality.
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,If it doesn&#39;t release on October 3rd then what are we even doing here?
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,I can already tell that this is going to be a movie that they have no business making
Mean Girls,2023-11-09,"For people living in a bubble with cottage cheese for brains, they will love this.  The rest of us are pulling out our hair at how backwards this is taking us in the art of film."
Mean Girls,2023-11-16,Is it just me or does the girl in the thumbnail kind of look like the love child of Kate McKinnon &amp; Pennywise?
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,Oh great. <br>Another remake of a perfect movie no one asked for.
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,I‚Äôm a guy and nothing will beat the OG mean girls
Mean Girls,2023-11-09,&quot;THIS ISN&#39;T YOUR MOTHER&#39;S MEAN GIRLS&quot; followed by a bunch of ever-so-mildly updated scenes from Mean Girls. Is this even a musical?
Mean Girls,2023-11-08,"I mean it&#39;s great that Tina Fay wrote it again but this just feels like a parody of itself ngl, also why remake something that&#39;s already so iconic and probably one the best teen comedy movies ever?"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,they taking &quot;why so serious? lets put a smile on that face&quot; to the next level
Smile 2,2024-09-03,Props to Paramount Pictures for the Upside down Stars to form the Smile
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I&#39;m sorry but that jumpscare at the end made me laugh it was so goofyüíÄüíÄ
Smile 2,2024-09-03,Naomi Scott deserves so many more big roles. She‚Äôs far too talented
Smile 2,2024-09-19,"For Halloween I‚Äôm not going to dress up as anything, I‚Äôm just going to smile at people randomlyüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>If anyone is wondering‚Ä¶ it went well, but most people didn‚Äôt get it at first lol üòÇ"

Smile 2,2024-09-13,"&quot;You&#39;re not in control, I AM!&quot; - Famous last words."
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HY6QFlBzUY&amp;t=29"">0:29</a> now that‚Äôs a smile that could rival the Grinch"
Smile 2,2024-09-04,I AM 100% sure they put all the movie highlights in this trailer...
Smile 2,2024-09-03,What she goes through looks far more severe than what Rose went through
Smile 2,2024-09-03,dang I was really hoping smile 2 would be about the cop Joel after he saw what happened to Rose. Hopefully we at least get a reference as to what happened to him.
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"I swear if this ends like the last movie, I&#39;m done."
Smile 2,2024-09-04,"As it‚Äôs usually the case with most horror movies, im sure that the trailer has shown us 90% of the jumpscares."
Smile 2,2024-09-29,Those smiles don&#39;t look as creepy as the ones from the first film.
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HY6QFlBzUY&amp;t=121"">2:01</a> goofy ahh jumpscare"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I never understood why they put jump scares in the trailer. It takes away the effect from when I go see the movie.
Smile 2,2024-09-03,The first movie was terrifying
Smile 2,2024-09-03,Was skeptical about the Pop Star idea at first but Naomi Scott looks like she‚Äôs COMPLETELY GAME for this role. Quite impressed.
Smile 2,2024-09-04,My favorite part from the first one was when rose said ‚Äúit‚Äôs smilin time‚Äù and smiled all over the place
Smile 2,2024-09-03,Ending: <br><br>She kills her self on stage in-front of the world spreading the Smile demon to the whole world
Smile 2,2024-09-03,That&#39;s my face when someone tells me to smile
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"If this trailer is any indication, this movie is going to be nuts. I can&#39;t for October 18th."
Smile 2,2024-09-14,The first one looked way scarier
Smile 2,2024-09-26,Another example that sequels don‚Äôt always hit as hard as the original
Smile 2,2024-09-03,October 18 - Smile 2<br>October 25 - Terrifier 3<br>Man Halloween gonna be great üéâ
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"&quot;These smiles are so creepy, they‚Äôre almost...adorably goofy! üò¨üòÇ"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,The 1st Trailer was better.
Smile 2,2024-10-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HY6QFlBzUY&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> best part of the trailer"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,that paramount logo as a smile chief&#39;s kiss
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I bet the opening scene shows Lewis witnessing Joel‚Äôs death and then you know what
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"Critical Overlord did mention a Scream Actor was gonna appear in Smile 2, I guess that was Drew Barrymore"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I don‚Äôt think this movie is gonna make me smile‚Ä¶
Smile 2,2024-09-03,"Honestly, it doesn&#39;t even pick up from the last smile legit is a whole different story"
Smile 2,2024-09-03,This made me SMILE so hard I‚Äôm so ready for this movie üòä

Smile 2,2024-09-03,That last shot was funnyüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I just hope that it doesn&#39;t end like the first movie. You can only do that ending once.
Smile 2,2024-09-03,I think the dude trying to help her might not be real.
Smile 2,2024-09-03,The trailer showed me 99% of the jump scares in the movie
Smile 2,2024-09-03,Naomi Scott is gonna be so incredible as Skye Riley!
Smile 2,2024-09-07,"Starts pretty strong, has a weak middle (repetitive and has the same structure as the predecessor) twist things up (get credit for it) but it doesnt really work and the thread doesnt feel as claustrophobic and atmosperic as the first. But it has some really strong visuals and also some nice jump scares. Who doesnt want to see them all, should avoid the trailer.<br>And before u all ask: i was at a test screening"
Smile 2,2024-09-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HY6QFlBzUY&amp;t=119"">1:59</a> ‚ÄúHe&#39;s right behind me, isn&#39;t he‚Äù ahh jumpscare"

Smile 2,2024-09-03,"This came up as an ad on a video and it peaked my interest. I never heard of the first one. So, I&#39;m going to watch it, then see this one."

Civil War,2023-12-13,Texas and California working together...now you know it&#39;s fiction
Civil War,2024-01-26,"I have to admit, this film having the most advanced advertising campaign for a movie in history."
Civil War,2023-12-13,"Jesse Plemmons almost never scream or shows a lot of emotion in facial expressions, he‚Äôs always calm but yet you just know if he is a dangerous psycho or a nice person.. incredible actor"
Civil War,2024-01-24,They better hurry getting this into cinemas before it&#39;s on the news
Civil War,2023-12-13,‚ÄúWell what kind of an American are you‚Äù - that was such a chilling line<br><br>Jesse Plemons always delivers‚Ä¶needs more recognition
Civil War,2024-01-27,Texas about to make the most successful movie promotion campaign ever.
Civil War,2024-01-26,Plot twist : the &quot;experience in IMAX Spring 2024&quot; means IRL
Civil War,2024-02-07,"A dialogue from 28 days later fits perfectly here.<br><b>It was not just on the tv screen anymore, it was outside your street, coming in through your windows</b>"
Civil War,2023-12-14,He did it.... Ron Swanson actually did it<br><br>He brought it all crumbling down
Civil War,2024-02-11,&quot;how do we make it so one political party doesnt hate our movie?&quot;<br>&quot;make it so texas and cali are on the same side&quot;
Civil War,2024-01-13,"Main character: &quot;President Swanson, Washington DC is under attack!&quot;<br>Ron: &quot;I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s my problem.&quot;<br>MC: &quot;They seized all of the bacon from every store in the area.&quot;<br>Ron: &quot;...Send in the Marines!&quot;"
Civil War,2023-12-13,"As a nation, I think we can all come together to agree that Jesse Plemons is one of our most underrated actors.  The guy legit scares the hell out of me."
Civil War,2023-12-20,I wanna see this in the theater before it comes to the streets
Civil War,2024-02-12,‚ÄúWhat kind of American are you?‚Äù That‚Äôs the scariest part of this entire trailer
Civil War,2023-12-15,You give Jesse Plemons 2 secs on screen and he leaves an impact. Most underrated actor imo.
Civil War,2023-12-16,This movie is really gonna help people anxious about social unrest
Civil War,2024-01-28,"the movie is so good, they are making the real life adaptation"

Civil War,2024-01-26,"This movie&#39;s budget is $50 million, but you could make it for free if you waited a little."
Civil War,2024-02-29,Surprised they didn&#39;t say &quot;Coming soon to a city near you!&quot; Lol
Civil War,2023-12-13,"Props to A24, I don&#39;t think any other studio would dare to take on such a project. Looks promising indeed."
Civil War,2024-03-24,Jesse Plemmons is one of the few actors who can come off as totally menacing while being nonchalant.
Civil War,2024-01-04,"I&#39;m not American. I am Spanish, but we also suffered a civil war in 1936, where brothers killed each other. The trailer has shocking moments, like simply the flag with only 2 stars, or the moment when it asks &quot;what kind of American are you?&quot; Despite not seeming like a really deep movie, it does seem very promising and interesting, so I will definitely watch it."
Civil War,2024-03-06,Jesse Plemons‚Äô contemptuous laugh really reminded me of Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Damn I miss him.
Civil War,2024-01-22,"First &quot;Leave the World Behind&quot;, now &quot;Civil War&quot;. Everyone better get ready for 2024."
Civil War,2023-12-13,"My first thought was &quot;damn feels like Jesse Plemons has a lot of cameo-like roles in big films recently&quot; but then he goes and has the best scene in the trailer and I&#39;m like &quot;oh never mind, he is just that good&quot; - Can&#39;t wait!!"
Civil War,2023-12-14,No way Ron Swanson would be against Texas.
Civil War,2023-12-15,"Finally, a heart warming film about real American values."
Civil War,2024-02-21,Hawaii just chillin.
Civil War,2023-12-21,&quot;What kind of American are you?&quot; <br>That gave me chills
Civil War,2023-12-26,"Jesse Plemons is becoming a supporting role headliner.  Breaking Bad, Killers of the Flower Moon and Love and Death are the accomplishments I‚Äôve seen him in.   I agree‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs always kills it‚Ä¶."
Civil War,2023-12-24,‚ÄúWhat kind of American are you‚Äù that was perfect!!

Civil War,2024-01-01,I‚Äôm very interested in seeing this because I never would‚Äôve pictured A24 taking on an action movie

Civil War,2024-02-09,I Never considered how scary a modern civil war would be with the tech we have today.  looks like like a very interesting movie
Civil War,2023-12-15,Ron Swan as the president on the government side is the most hilarious thing ever.ü§£ü§£ü§£

Civil War,2024-01-25,This documentary looks lit!
Civil War,2023-12-14,"If this is a war movie that feels like a horror movie, then it might actually have some value"
Civil War,2023-12-13,"If Texas and California broke away from the US and allied together against Washington DC, then the American government must have really done something to deserve it."
Civil War,2023-12-15,The craziest part of this trailer is them saying Texas and California are on the same team.  I would‚Äôve thought those would‚Äôve been the two team captains for the opposing sides üòÖ
Civil War,2023-12-13,"This looks incredible, and the Jesse Plemons scene is CHILLING. He&#39;s so good at that role of discomfort."

Civil War,2023-12-13,So happy to see Wagner Moura and especially Kirsten Dunst back on big screen. I am definitely going to go see this
Civil War,2023-12-14,The predictive programming is strong with this one.
Civil War,2023-12-14,Looks promising.
Civil War,2023-12-15,"Based on the comments, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who realizes this totally fits in the social conditioning category. There is no coming back if our society crumbles to the point this happens; and I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s the stance they took with this. War is glamorous and exciting until the bullets start flying, your children starve, and there is no structure left. Bosnia is a lesson few people heeded."
Civil War,2024-01-11,"In theaters Spring 2024, coming to a street near you Fall 2024."
Civil War,2024-03-11,The guy which idea it was to let Nick Offerman play the President deserves a raise.
Civil War,2024-01-05,If you look at Alex Garland‚Äôs past work you know this has the potential to be a damn good movie
Civil War,2023-12-24,Idk his name but that dude with the red glasses and army suit. He is a scene stealer. If he is in a movie. He absolutely crushes it
Civil War,2023-12-13,"If Kirsten and Jesse want to keep on acting in the same movies and tv shows from now on, I have no problem with that. Love them as a couple and superior actors. This looks fantastic. Love whatever brilliant things pop into Alex Gardener&#39;s brain!"
Civil War,2023-12-24,"All I can say is, it‚Äôs not about what happens during a civil war that counts. It‚Äôs about what happens after a civil war that truly counts."
Civil War,2024-01-26,Really weird watching this trailer now and thinking we may be in a civil war before the movie comes out.
Civil War,2024-03-10,Tobey Maguire watching this film:<br><br>HOLD ON MARY JANE!
Civil War,2023-12-22,The guy with the orange glasses is obviously the good guy.
Civil War,2024-04-03,"Alaska: hey, Canada...can I maybe like..come over?"
Civil War,2024-04-10,They&#39;ve started making the documentaries about the wars before they happen.  What incredible times we live in.
Civil War,2023-12-21,"Man I hope we as Americans can come together and avoid anything like this from ever happening again to this great country. This is the type of stuff that our enemies would love to see, no matter our political differences for the sake of our children and our country we must never let stuff like this happen again. After 22 years of service in the military I‚Äôve seen war three times and I pray that what I‚Äôve seen overseas never comes to our door step."
Civil War,2023-12-15,"This doesn&#39;t look like an action film, it looks like a horror film! I can&#39;t wait!"
Civil War,2024-01-30,"I&#39;m calling it, in a couple of months someone in YouTube is going to recreate this trailer using real ife footage"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-11-30,"I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more crazy, the fact that we are getting another one of these movies, or the fact that it has been 8 years since Fury Road... What a day! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I like George Miller because the camera is always steady and the action is always centered. I don&#39;t know why so many action directors refuse to do those two simple things.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Nobody builds post-apocalyptic war machines like George and his team. Absolutely incredible.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Fury Road is still one of the best theater experiences I&#39;ve ever had. Definitely checking this out.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"One of the things I love about this franchise is the language of the post-apocalypse. Running with the theme of the survivors of the apocalypse all having lost their minds, the meanings of words seem to have been forgotten or mixed up. There are a lot of instances of this throughout all of the films, such as ‚Äúlady and gentlemens‚Äù ‚ÄúI should be in Valhalla, McFeasting with heroes‚Äù ‚ÄúThe ayatollah of rock and roll-ah‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt was your Manifest Destiny to not perish‚Äù. It adds so much character to the world. The Mad Max wasteland is a place where all of the norms and vernacular of our society have been abandoned, hence why people act and talk in the bizarre way they do. It gives rewatches of the films extra value just to try and spot all the weird apocalyptic slang."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-11-30,George Miller is in his late 70s and still pumping to make a huge big budget action movie like this is absolutely crazy and amazing. This man deserves his &quot;legend&quot; status
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"Me and my mother watched the original movies and she absolutely loved FURY ROAD. She passed away in 2021, however I know for a fact she would have loved to have seen this film. I may not be able to see it with her, but the memory of us seeing the films together will always be there."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,&quot;Do you have it in you to make it epic&quot; is such a great line for a Mad Max world.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-02-06,"Hemsworth can finally use his native accent in a movie after all these years! Jokes aside, movie looks dope."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-01-23,"Mad Max Fury was the greatest theatre experience i had...pure goosebumps, entire movie"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Chris Hemsworth has been choosing really good roles post-MCU. So great to see him in stuff like this one
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Fury Road was an unexpected classic. One of my absolute favorite movies. Excited to see what this brings.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-11,Please don&#39;t let this be a bad movie. I am basing my entire mental health for the next decade on this movie.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"I love that they stuck to that very vibrant,stark and harsh colour palette. It makes the whole post-apocalyptic thing so visceral. It‚Äôs going to be another visually stunning 2024 release. I‚Äôm so excited!"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"One of the beauties of Fury Road was the prioritization of practical effects.  This looks great, but does feel far more CG at first glance."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-03,One of the things that made Fury Road so good was the practical effects. It added to the suspended reality with the sense of realism. I see A LOT of cgi in this trailer. I really hope that this movie is awesome because i have loved the world of Mad Max since i was a child watching The Road Warrior.  The cgi kind of kills it for me though.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I&#39;ll never forget how great Fury Road was to watch in the cinema. I can&#39;t wait for this!!!
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,I love them going into the backstory of the ‚ÄúBullet Farm‚Äù. It‚Äôs great to flesh out the lore. This definitely will be a theater watch.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,What a lovely day!!! Really excited for you all to hear the score in 2024!
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Fury Road in theaters was such a special thing. I went in nostalgic remembering being a kid seeing original 3 on tv. Left feeling hopeful in a hopeless land. Hearing ‚Äúremember me‚Äù and the quote at the end drove it home. We just wonder this wasteland in search of a better selves
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,This seems like a refreshing role for Chris Hemsworth.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-08,"A little bummed to see a much heavier use of CGI, but apart from that it looks badass! Can‚Äôt wait to see it"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"I do hope we can maintain what made Fury Road great. Good use of practical effects and less reliance on CGI, it really made it a memorable experience."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Ill never forget seeing Fury Road in theaters. Cant wait for this.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,45 years after the collapse... so Mad Max really is like some kinda mythical ageless person in this universe. Very cool
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"Whether it be the aesthetics or how the scenes are shot, no one does post-apocalyptic films like George Miller."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"Seems a bit more CGI heavy than the first which used a lot of practical effects but hopefully it&#39;s just used to augment the use of practical effects on open world sets.  I mean George Miller has to know what helped Mad Max be so successful in the eyes of fans was the use of practical effects so hopefully he didn&#39;t abandon them entirely.  Also, ATJ being in this is a huge selling point.  Yeah, her big eyes are uniquely spaced so she&#39;s very noticeable in any scene she&#39;s in BUT she is also a very talented actress.  I&#39;ve only seen her in a few movies like The Witch or The Northman but she&#39;s legit good.  She&#39;s the new Noomi Rapace or something."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"These movies always have such awesome vehicles. That monster tow truck and war rig are amazing, but the rat rod buggy is perfect. The people that engineer and build these vehicles are true artists."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-06,This looks awesome but I also want another Mad Max movie with Tom Hardy.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"I watched Fury Road three days straight when it came out over the weekend, invited someone new to see it with me each time. Watched it five times total in theatres, bought copies of the movie on dvd to ‚Äúshare the gospel,‚Äù it was amazing. I sincerely hope this movie is the same."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"&quot;WHAT A DAY , WHAT A LOVELY DAY &quot; <br>finally the year is here where i can feel the madness of madmax saga again"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-03-06,Fury Road was so well shot and executed it still blows my mind. Looking forward to this one. &lt;3
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,As an Aussie I‚Äôm so proud of George Miller and the entire mad max franchise. This looks epic!
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"They want you to think they made this insane action epic about a post-apocalyptic future, but really, this is just how people in Australia live every day."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-28,Hemsworth riding a chariot attached to two Harleys is epic
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,Thor riding a motorcycle themed chariot to Valhalla is the most metal moment this year
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,That musical score is pure üî•üî•üî•
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I hope this movie does well enough at the box office for another Mad Max sequel to be made (and please bring back Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron)
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,"Fury Road is one of my top 3 movies of all time, and I am SO excited to see more of this world and Furiosa!"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-18,I remember watching fury road in the theatres and being absolutely blown away by it. I will watch this just for hopes that will happen again!
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,"Oh, I hope it‚Äôs good. Fury Road was so shockingly outstanding. An absolutely perfect film. I really hope this can match it."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-03-09,That final shot of Furiosa might be one of my favorite shots I‚Äôve seen all year
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-01-20,I missed Fury Road in theaters and i&#39;m still crying to this day. Movie doesnt tell me much but i wont make same mistake twice.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-03,"I don&#39;t know about all that cgi. Part of what makes Mad Max, and especially Fury Road so great was the emphasis on practical effects. George Miller poured his heart into Fury Road, and I would hate for him to give up and just rely on cgi, like Peter Jackson did on the Hobbit movies... would be a shame. Still excited for the movie. The story and setting are perfect and I am really hoping that the poor visuals are just because they had to make a trailer real quick and the final release will be much better."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-03-10,"Saw the trailer in IMAX before Dune 2. This looks really, really cool!"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-04-08,Chris Hemsworth riding on a motorcycle chariot. This is going to be an amazing ride.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"my biggest complaint is there looks to be a lotttt of cgi in this unlike fury road where everything was almost real so it felt so real, just hope that it can live up to the hype buildup and the status set by fury road"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,The CGI is definitely standing out in a franchise mostly dominated by practical effects
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-19,"I just want to take a moment and thank the people that made this trailer for not taking an old song, adding ridiculous and obnoxious amounts of base drum hits and calling it a day.   (Yes, this trailer has a lot of bass drums, but it, ya know, actually fits for what happens in the movie...  What a concept!) Thank you.  Also, a trailer in 4k?!  I never thought I&#39;d see the day.  Killing it."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,The excitement within me about having another Mad Max movie. Fury Road Still the best action movie I&#39;ve ever watched.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I got chills as soon as it began. Watching Fury Road in theaters was such an incredible experience. Looks like the vibe is similar - can‚Äôt wait
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-22,"The director is 78 years old, still unbeatable in action movies since MadMax fury road. Amazing, classical and wonderfull man."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I hope it&#39;s just as good. Fury Road had a great blend of not knowing what was CGI and what was practical effects. I hope this does the same.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,"I think George Miller is the director I&#39;d most like to meet for dinner or an interview, the depth of the man&#39;s career and work is incredible."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,The movie seems like it&#39;s going to be amazing. But idk if it&#39;s just me or what but seems like it&#39;s SUPER CGI heavy. Some of the vehicles looks like a video game
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"The adrenaline I get from the action sequences from Fury Road and the trailer from this has made Miller one of my favorites especially with the camera work. Anya Taylor-Joy is going to KILL the role too, really excited to see her in a high-action movie"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I&#39;ve waited years for this movie! George Miller makes instant classics
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s almost been 10 years since the last one. After watching this trailer, it feels like we never left."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-14,rooting for this one. I know George has been wanting to give Furiosa her own movie since the last one came out
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"This trailer is amazing, hypes me up just like the fury road trailer did. This movie looks like it‚Äôs gonna be an immersive fever dream when you see it in IMAX."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-02-04,"If George can even capture half the magic of the previous film, this will be good."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,I can already tell the soundtrack is going to be filled with absolute bangers.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"George Miller is one of the few directors whose scope I can‚Äôt even fathom; I don‚Äôt know how he has the vision or imagination to put films like this together. The set pieces, cinematography, stunts, and camera angles‚Ä¶ The amount of work you have to put into making and coordinating these films? Many other directors aren‚Äôt even capable. I don‚Äôt think even Christopher Nolan has the experience or expertise to put together anything like a Mad Max Fury Road. Miller is incredible."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-02-05,My god the score just sounds absolutely visceral. One of the best trailers i‚Äôve ever seen. THATS how it‚Äôs done<br><br>update: uh weirdly this music from the trailer NEVER showed up in the film. Kinda disappointed by the score overall tbh. Still an incredible film but could‚Äôve been elevated just like the first movie.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,"Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Character being the villain in this has me all in. And man the vehicles  look so good, the cinematography, the Action sequences, and everything else looks great.<br><br>George Miller is such a talented director even if he‚Äôs in his 70&#39;s he‚Äôs still got it."
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-02,I think I will just watch road warrior again for the thousandth time.
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024-03-24,I cry everytime of the happiness knowing another Mad Max movie is on the way. Mad Max Fury Road and the Road Warrior are movies i‚Äôve rewatched countless times
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2023-12-01,Looks awesome! Sad it took 8 years. I hope we can get at least one more Mad Max out of George Miller and Tom Hardy.

The Beekeeper,2023-10-05,"After all this time, I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re finally finishing the Bee Trilogy: Bee Movie, Secret Life of Bees, and finally, The Beekeeper. Never thought it would happen. So excited."
The Beekeeper,2023-10-05,As someone who‚Äôs credit card üí≥ been stolen by people like this I approve of this movie
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,This is a certified bee keeper classic
The Beekeeper,2023-10-16,"Blue collar legend. A transporter, mechanic, and now a bee keeper."
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve been curious about what all beekeepers do. Looking forward to seeing this documentary.
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,I lost it when he took down the FBI strike team with his bare hands
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,Finally a movie where I get to see scammers get what they deserve.
The Beekeeper,2023-10-10,This movie needs to be seen twice in theaters to show u how to deal with scammers and telemarketers the dialing finger removal and cliff execution = brilliance. Well played Mr Statham.
The Beekeeper,2024-01-11,Finally someone is actually defending the bees!!! Do you know how important the bees are for the our world? Thank you Jason Statham!
The Beekeeper,2023-10-17,"I see Jason is broadening his acting chops and diversifying the movies he&#39;s in ... a Beekeeper is a really nice change of pace from his other movies where he&#39;s some guy on a path of vengeance due to someone killing his family, friend and/or dog"
The Beekeeper,2023-12-19,"I would like to officially declare that this movie is dedicated to all the victims of inhuman money scammers and their rage, anger and what they would do to their scammers if they find them."

The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,Man nobody does action like Jason. Totally in!!
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,"Idk if its intentional, but I like the metaphor of beekeeping as Jason Statham taking care of the worker bees, i.e regular working people."
The Beekeeper,2023-10-05,AWESOME!! Jason doing what he does best! <br>Jason and Liam&#39;s action never &quot;gets old&quot;!
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,Man this looks cheesy and fun and badass - im in!

The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,I loved the part where he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs beekeeping time‚Äù and beekept all over the place.
The Beekeeper,2024-01-07,I just saw this movie tonight as an early premiere...all I&#39;m going to say is Jason Statham once again has done a fantastic job and this is a must-see to start off 2024
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,"BOY is Statham TOTALLY joining the likes of Chris Pratt and Keanu Reeves etc as this century&#39;s golden action boys, the ones who are stepping into the shoes of the old boys from the 20th like Sly and Arnie. They may sadly be moving on, but man is Statham continuing to absolutely rock with action movies we know are totally worth it of seeing, YES, aye"
The Beekeeper,2023-12-06,well thank god Jason Stathom is branching out.  I was worried he&#39;d do another action movie where he fights a thousand people in unbeatable odds and wins.  A humble bee keeper movie.  Can&#39;t wait.
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,"This is gonna be the &#39;feel good&#39; movie of the year, son!!! üêùüëä"

The Beekeeper,2023-12-26,"Wow. I&#39;ve never seen Jason Statham in a role  like this. He&#39;s always playing the quiet, brainy type. Good for him, showing some range!"
The Beekeeper,2024-01-04,A Middle age man wrecking havoc is my favorite genre
The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,All the more reason to be a beekeeper!  We have now been made into a John Wick type character. Excellent!

The Beekeeper,2023-10-04,We so need this movie right now!!
The Beekeeper,2023-10-07,"Definitely, definitely, definitely watching this. For far too long nature-loving people have been portrayed as soft. As a nature conservationist, I dig this wild violence to fight systemic violence. More naturalists need to be outlaws and vigilantes."

Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"You know what would be a really cool twist? I mean, I know the movie is already finished and all, but hear me out. What if‚Ä¶they actually fall for each other? Right? Like, while pretending to be a couple, they find out things about each other that deepens their connection and they end up falling in love. But neither wants to admit it to the other. And then at the end, just when the woman he‚Äôs trying to make jealous comes around and you think he‚Äôs going to go off with her, and Sweeney‚Äôs character is sad‚Ä¶he shows up at her door and is like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one I‚Äôm in love with.‚Äù<br><br>Crazy, I know. I should leave the scriptwriting to the professionals."
Anyone But You,2024-01-20,"it‚Äôs amazing to see how a change of music and video cutting has changed the vibe and for me, made it more interesting"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,10/10 for the leads. <br><br>Also kudos to the makers for taking a huge loss and letting us watch the entire movie on YouTube.
Anyone But You,2024-01-11,This could&#39;ve went straight to Netflix üòÇ
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Old man on plane has best line delivery by far üòÇüòÇ

Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Finally a better trailer than the previous one
Anyone But You,2023-11-24,"I can&#39;t wait to see a romantic comedy in theaters. üéâ<br><br>I sound sarcastic but seriously I&#39;m so nostalgic for just midbudget romantic comedies with strong leads right now. That sounds like such a breath of fresh air. <br><br>These leads look funny and like they have great chemistry and there&#39;s just the right amount of been there done that, and also edge and sex appeal. We rarely get movies like this anymore üòä"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Gotta admit I actually chuckled 2 times
Anyone But You,2024-01-27,"A lot of old timers here that I have been watching for many years, Dermot Patrick Mulrone whom I LOVE in movies, especially The Thing called Love, such a great movie with Sandra, and many other amazing actors. Rachel Anne Griffiths I have loved for many years as well, especially in Muriel&#39;s Wedding...such an amazing movie.  I didn&#39;t think the movie was starting that great at first, then it grew on me. It really did. The end? BEST ending ever, when they all sing the song. I love to see that in movies, when they are all doing something together, be it singing or dancing. Great cast, great movie. Great actors.‚ù§üéâ‚ù§"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I feel like this movie is made just to admire the leads&#39;s bodies lmao
Anyone But You,2024-02-17,$25m budget vs $173m box office. That‚Äôs impressive. Enjoyed it ‚ù§
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I love the part where Madame Web says &quot;it&#39;s webbing time&quot; and---oh wait wrong trailer
Anyone But You,2023-11-20,"Even the most played-out romantic comedy premise can work with the right actors; Sydney and Glen have such a spark between them, and I can&#39;t wait to see it on screen."
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,finally !!!!! it seems like the marketing team took the audience feedback seriously and made a trailer that better suits the tone of a romantic COMEDY. this looks like good clean fun. consider me seated üçø
Anyone But You,2024-01-16,"I watched this movie tonight. It&#39;s pretty solid considering the fact it&#39;s a romantic comedy. I didn&#39;t expect anything deep or groundbreaking so I wasn&#39;t disappointed. On the contrary, I even had fun. Sydney and Glen have amazing energy, they&#39;re great to look at and the movie was a fresh summer breeze in my dark cold winter days. It doesn&#39;t pretend it&#39;s something it&#39;s not, it&#39;s fun and lighthearted ‚Äî definitely wouldn&#39;t mind seeing it again sometime in the future."
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Definitely looks like one of the movies of all time.
Anyone But You,2024-01-30,That‚Äôs the only appropriate reaction when you have a spider in your pants ü§£
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I think it&#39;s genius to have the clip of Sydney and Glenn playfully talking about the trailer at the beginning. It matches perfectly with their characters&#39;s dynamic in the movie!üòÇ
Anyone But You,2024-05-01,It‚Äôs like if the popular kids from high school wrote an enemies to lovers
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I&#39;m kinda excited for this after all the bad toxic romances we got. <br>I like them enough maybe it will fun
Anyone But You,2023-11-28,"This movie actually looks pretty funny lol. The opening bit was good lol, gave me a good chuckle. People say it‚Äôs an unoriginal movie plot and predictable but lol you could say that about most movies. It‚Äôs all about execution. Looks good lol."
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=83"">1:23</a> Sydney rules like everytime"
Anyone But You,2023-11-27,I‚Äôm gonna predict how this movie ends: the two people who fake being in love actually fall in love.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,That spider part was actually pretty hilarious üòÇ
Anyone But You,2024-01-02,"I don&#39;t care if the movie is boring , I am gonna support Sydney .I feel she is a really good actor  when i watched her on euphoria. I want to see more of her."
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"Sydney, Sydney &amp; Sydney, that‚Äôs all one needs to see this."
Anyone But You,2024-04-15,I&#39;m really looking forward to it being released in Japan in May!
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I already know why I&#39;m going to see this. I love Sydney
Anyone But You,2023-11-22,Why were people bashing this trailer? I actually kinda love it. It&#39;s very early 2000s romcom and it plays to that!
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I CANT WAIT!!! I love Sydney!ü´∂üèºü´Ç
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,I‚Äôm only here because of Nathan Fielder‚Äôs apology. Who would actually go see this in a theater is beyond me. üòÇ
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"After No Hard Feelings, now this, sounds like rom-coms are making a comeback, it would a good watch for couples on Valentine&#39;s Day, ngl Sidney Sweeney looks pretty hot, and I like Glen Powell&#39;s confidence, even after getting rid of that spider."
Anyone But You,2023-12-14,enemies to lovers and fake relationship? LITERALLY TWO OF MY FAVORITE TROPES IN ONE MOVIE PLUS AN OLIVIA RODRIGO SONG THAT I LOVE? PLUS A ROM COM??!
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Sydney is such a really good actress. I&#39;m sorry that she&#39;s reduced to her body... But I&#39;m happy for her career !
Anyone But You,2023-12-12,I am fangirling for a movie I haven&#39;t even seen yet. The fake dating to actually falling for each other trope is so cute! I am so excited to see this on screen!
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,This trailer is way better and actually showcases their chemistry
Anyone But You,2023-11-18,"I need a light romcom like this tbh, LOVE IT!"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> this songü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"

Anyone But You,2023-11-16,This feels like the adult version of to all the boys I&#39;ve loved before
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,The intro could only have been written by someone who graduated from one of Canada&#39;s top business schools with really good grades.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Not gonna lie this looks DECENT!!!!.
Anyone But You,2023-11-29,This guy reminds me of a young Matthew McConaughey due to his charisma on screen. I&#39;ve only ever seen him in Top Gun 2 and remembered him from that movie.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Two big reasons to watch this movie
Anyone But You,2024-02-15,"Silver linings playbook is everything this film wishes it could be , not bad for a romcom but just never lands what it‚Äôs trying to do"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Cassie is so beautiful and I&#39;m in love with her in this movie.üòçüòçüòçüòç
Anyone But You,2024-05-05,Besides the 3 known actors. The rest of the cast couldn&#39;t act.  The hype of this movie was absolutely hilarious.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"how much Glen won making this film is not written... damn it, I wanted to be in his place SO BAD"
Anyone But You,2023-11-18,Who is here cause of Nathan fielder?
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I am convinced that this man is ready to play Booster Gold! üíôüíõ‚ö°Ô∏è
Anyone But You,2024-04-20,That part got me....<br>Peaches peaches peaches peaches üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I must not be seeing what everyone else is seeing because I always see people talking about how amazing of an actress Sydney Sweeney is but her line delivery sounds so dead in everything I&#39;ve ever seen her in????
Anyone But You,2024-01-14,I watched this last night and had dreams all night that i was going on a boat with my work managers singing to Natasha Bedingfields Unwritten. Im going through a strange phase
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I love the part where she gave him her shorts.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anyone But You,2024-03-31,Movie better than trailer would suggest.  A decent amount of funny one liners and solid Alt/Indie soundtrack.  7/10.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Well thankfully this looks a lot better than the teaser
Anyone But You,2023-12-21,I always love a ‚Äúfake couple between rivals‚Äù story every once in a while. This should be interesting
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,this is so much better because you couldn‚Äôt tell what the plot was about in the first trailer
Anyone But You,2024-02-18,Best scene is when she steals the cookie in the airplane - just hilarious!
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,omg i love sydney she stole my heart everytime
Anyone But You,2023-12-22,"where can i watch this movie, guys????????????????????????????????????//"
Anyone But You,2024-01-06,"I can&#39;t wait to see a romantic comedy in theaters. üéâ<br><br>I sound sarcastic but seriously I&#39;m so nostalgic for just midbudget romantic comedies with strong leads right now. That sounds like such a breath of fresh hair."
Anyone But You,2024-05-01,Sequel pls!!! üôèüíõAnyone But Them - where Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell attend their exs‚Äô wedding in the movie
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,I already know why I&#39;m going to watch this üòàüòàüòà
Anyone But You,2024-02-09,Don&#39;t forget to throw in the biracial LGBTQ couple to make sure everyone gets the message.
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,This is going to be iconic
Anyone But You,2023-12-22,"The spider bit was so funny...only Aussies would understand. Leeches would have made more sense there. Considering as soon as you step near the mountains or a waterfall in Australia,  you&#39;ll find a leech in your nether regions"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,"Okay finally a couple with good chemistry<br><br>(Edit: I do not need a film lesson from strangers on youtube, it looks fun and the leads look amazing together and I&#39;m excited to watch it on a day I&#39;ll be relaxing. Sorry I&#39;m not as intellectual as the people who are determined to showcase their knowledge on films in the comments section of a rom-com trailer.üòó)"
Anyone But You,2023-11-18,I actually was expecting smth way better. This trailer is better than the first one but it&#39;s still cringe and the acting and dialogue seem wooden. I&#39;ll wait to watch it online. They also have ZERO chemistry with each other.
Anyone But You,2024-04-23,"I know this is an usual, predictable, and clich√© romcom movie but I enjoyed watching this movie! Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney have a great chemistry in this film."
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,"Looks like a good, adult comedy üçøüòä"
Anyone But You,2023-11-20,"This is giving off a friends with benefits , no strings attached kinda vibe ‚Ä¶.<br><br>AYO HOLD UP"
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,I love Glen!! And I‚Äôm excited to see Sydney in this movie as well!
Anyone But You,2024-02-10,"if you just like me : no partner on Valentine, just find this movie, it makes your valentine lonely night much better."
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Soooooo much better than the first trailer. Now I want to watch it.
Anyone But You,2024-02-23,There‚Äôs probably only two reasons to watch this
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, but Sydney and Glenn both look like that they could have been a couple in real-life. I also hope they both work together again after Anyone But You, like, become the next Leonardo DiCaprio &amp; Kate Winslet, Adam Sandler &amp; Drew Barrymore, and Emma Stone &amp; Ryan Gosling"
Anyone But You,2024-03-04,I can&#39;t wait to watch this.  I miss the romantic comedies of the early 1990 early  2000s.  They seem to have great chemistry. I love Sydney Sweeney. Who else is excited about this movie?  It&#39;s got that nostalgic feel.
Anyone But You,2024-02-13,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> Sexual assault in a romcom?"
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,Sydney Sweeney&#39;s delivery in this is worse than Grubhub in a blizzard
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,this is going to be one of the movies of all time i can already tell
Anyone But You,2024-03-08,The last scene had me laughingüòÇi was laughing so hardüòÇüòÖ
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Lol! Looks great! I love enemies to lovers or along those lines!
Anyone But You,2023-11-18,Ngl the spider scene has me genuinely laughing pretty hard üòÇ
Anyone But You,2023-11-17,"Who is the old man at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=31"">0:31</a>? I swear I recognise him from another show"
Anyone But You,2024-05-24,‚ÄúIm not a magic lamp‚Äù üò≠
Anyone But You,2024-02-25,"The worst movie I have seen in a loooong while. If this is our concept of love and comedy, we are lost. I really regret that I&#39;ve spent money buying tickets."
Anyone But You,2023-11-19,There&#39;s a NINE YEAR age gap between them!!!!!
Anyone But You,2023-12-03,"Finally - a movie that‚Äôs just fun and a break from the riveting, original films Hollywood has been shitting out for the last 10 or so years."
Anyone But You,2023-12-24,&quot;Hey hangman you look good!&quot;
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,So they gave the whole movie away in the 2 trailers
Anyone But You,2023-12-19,"No interest in seeing this but got to admit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=32"">0:32</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=35"">0:35</a> made me laugh"
Anyone But You,2023-11-16,Can&#39;t wait for this one!!
Anyone But You,2024-03-03,"Hiking, wedding, traveling, friends<br>It&#39;s a romantic comedy"
Anyone But You,2023-11-18,This looks like Nathan Fielder‚Äôs best work yet

Anyone But You,2024-02-09,Am i the only one who don&#39;t like those new movies i find it so boring not like the old ones üò¢ there is no story or scenario just nothing
Anyone But You,2024-02-28,Am I the only one who saw the thumbnail and was like &quot;PAXTON WHATRE YOU DOING HERE?&quot;
Anyone But You,2024-04-28,"This one of the best Rom Coms I watched in a long time, my cheeks hurt from how hard I&#39;m smiling üòÅüòÜü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"‚ÄúIf we survive this, I‚Äôm going to kill you‚Äù at least they stuck to it"
Transformers One,2024-04-19,Bee: &quot;Badassatronnnnn&quot;<br>D-16: (taking notes) &quot;Hmm yess I see. I like the voice.&quot;
Transformers One,2024-04-19,Seeing the Autobots casually hanging out with Megatron is funny and weird at the same time
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"The end of the movie- &quot;It&#39;s over megatron, I have the high ground&quot;"
Transformers One,2024-04-20,Legitimately impressed that Chris Hemsworth can change his voice that much. I didn‚Äôt even know it was him.
Transformers One,2024-06-17,"Saw the film at an early screening at Annecy, and I have to say the trailer doesn‚Äôt do the film justice at all. The writing isn‚Äôt as cheesy as it seems here, and actually handles mature themes surprisingly well in a way where I think OG fans will appreciate.<br><br>All I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised, and walked out the cinema feeling hyped af"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,I understand why people are complaining but I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre getting a transformers movie without humans üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"I see, that&#39;s why Megatron never call Optimus by his name. Megatron always call him Prime."
Transformers One,2024-04-20,The colors bouncing off the Cybertronians made me remember that Cybertron used to be filled with so much life
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Nobody hates Transformers like Transformers fans
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"I like it, but I&#39;m not sure how I feel about the backstory. It seems like Megatron isn&#39;t a gladiator and Optimus isn&#39;t a record keeper. They&#39;re just two guys who get arrested and make friends while working hard labor."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,So from I gathered this movie;<br>1. Takes place LONG before the Golden Age of Cybertron<br>2. Not all cybertronians have a vehicle mode and need to be given a T-Cog<br>3. The Quintessons are basically in charge and will have to fought be against by the cybertronians like in G1 and the other continuities<br>4. Orion and Megs are pretty much teenagers here before taking on being a Records Clerk and Gladiator and just laborers<br>5. Cybertrons surface is closed off by most of the populace<br><br>I‚Äôm a bit iffy on the humor but it makes sense given it takes place before the Bots and Cons fight for the next 4 Million years
Transformers One,2024-04-18,‚ÄúComedy!?‚Äù As if the OG show never happened and Optimus didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúa booby trap that actually catches boobies‚Äù
Transformers One,2024-04-20,Actual people: &quot;oMg ThIs Is ThE fIrSt AnImAtEd TrAnSfOrMeRs MoViE!&quot;<br><br>Me: Exqueeze me?

Transformers One,2024-04-21,I‚Äôm just so happy to see Transformers get a genuine modern animated feature film adaptation
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"D-16: if we survive this, i&#39;m gonna kill you!<br>Orion: i acept those terms!<br>Megatron: and i took that personaly"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,I am completely shocked that airachnid made a cameo in this.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"Not a lot of ppl know this, but back in the day, animated movies used to hire actual voice actors and not just celebrities."
Transformers One,2024-04-21,"It&#39;s a pity that Chester won&#39;t see this movie. He loved transformers. Rest in peace, our friend."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,We were brothers once - Megatron

Transformers One,2024-04-18,"So, Megatron and Optimus are gonna be in their teenage years here, huh?<br><br>And by the looks of it we&#39;re gonna see the war for Cybertron&#39;s freedom against the Quintessons rather than the main one where Optimus and Megatron are enemies."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,&quot;What are we? some sort of transformers one?&quot;
Transformers One,2024-04-18,<b>‚ÄúI will transform into a truck now.‚Äù</b>
Transformers One,2024-04-19,"So like, did Paramount send their employees to make memes in the comment section, I don&#39;t think 90% of these were typed by real people lmao"
Transformers One,2024-07-24,They finally understood we&#39;re here for the robots and not the humans
Transformers One,2024-04-18,&quot;We need a movie on Cybertron without any humans&quot; the transformers fans cry out.<br>The monkey&#39;s paw curls a single finger.
Transformers One,2024-04-19,Why do I get a strong feeling that Bee running away is going to be a trending meme!ü§£
Transformers One,2024-04-19,this seems like a very ‚Äúhes right behind me isn‚Äôt he ‚Äù kinda movie
Transformers One,2024-07-05,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=4"">0:04</a> in detention with your friend after causing trouble"
Transformers One,2024-04-20,Now I beg Hasbro and Activision to bring back the War For Cybertron and Fall Of Cybertron games!
Transformers One,2024-04-20,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> That was pretty smooth attack."
Transformers One,2024-04-19,"Everyone&#39;s gonna complain about the comedy, but when the ending rolls around and D-16 becomes Megatron... hoo boy, it&#39;ll be a sight."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,I didn&#39;t think this would be a comedy.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Whoever is voicing Optimus / Orion in this legitimately sounds how I‚Äôd imagine a young Optimus to sound
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"Okay, now I get why Optimus was being voiced by Chris Hemsworth. He&#39;s not actually Optimus...<br><br>Yet."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"<b>sees starscream, soundwave, and shockwave all in the same room</b><br><br>Me: ITS DA BIG 3 :D"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Chris Hemsworth lowkey does sound like a young Peter Cullen. The ‚ÄúI knoooow we‚Äôre just lowly worker bots‚Äù line sold me. He draws out the vowels. No notes.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"This time, *this time*, blowing half the budget on voice actors who aren&#39;t voice actors will finally work.  I can feel it."
Transformers One,2024-04-19,"Before ripping Jazz in half, Megatron was D-16"
Transformers One,2024-04-19,A Starscream in a throne... üòÇ ... ain&#39;t going to last.
Transformers One,2024-04-19,"Fans: &quot;This movie is too silly and ridiculous! Why can&#39;t it be more like the G1 cartoon?!&quot;<br><br>G1 cartoon: Literally has episodes where a giant alien kid uses the Transformers as toys, the Quintessons bring a kid&#39;s nightmares to life to attack the Transformers, and an Autobot falls in love with an alien mermaid."

Transformers One,2024-04-18,"for those complaining about the humor, the director said that the film will start off lighthearted and humor-filled but will get darker and more intense as Orion and Megatron/d - 16 discover how corrupt their society actually is and how the war will start. also, the first trailer for into the spider verse was also full of corny jokes but the actual film was emotionally driven FYI."
Transformers One,2024-04-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> <br>‚ÄúAh! He said it! He said it!‚Äù"
Transformers One,2024-04-19,The CGI is actually pretty solid. Especially with the outdoor scenes.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"Like they frankensteined the scripts of every Pixar and Lego movie, and filtered it through a Transformers wiki."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"I know before Optimus and Megatron founded Autobots and Decepticons, they were friends, Optimus was a data clerk, while Megatron was a gladiator/fighter in the arena. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t expecting them to be close friends like in the opening."
Transformers One,2024-04-20,I kind of understand why a lot of people don‚Äôt like it. But I do. I think most people just aren‚Äôt used to the tone or mood this movie has unlike most transformers media.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"Remember! <br>when Transformers animated was first announced, people hated how it looked, when Transformers Prime was first announced people hated the designs.<br><br>Just because it looks bad now, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll be bad. Animated has one of the least G1 accurate plots, but it is one of the fan favorites. Transformers prime was very similar to having very different from G1. So this one might actually turn out good.<br><br>Plus, if this does good, there‚Äôs a chance we‚Äôll get better Transformers content in the future"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,&quot;But I don&#39;t want a light-hearted animated transformers movie set on Cybertron!&quot;<br>&quot;Then why did you ask for it!?&quot;
Transformers One,2024-04-19,The casual &quot;I thought you weren&#39;t talking to me.&quot; üíÄ
Transformers One,2024-04-19,I feel like they only showed the comedy section to hide whats gonna come later in the film and I think thats very smart
Transformers One,2024-04-20,Two Transformers movies within 12 months of each other!? Seems like a good time to be alive!!
Transformers One,2024-04-19,Why do Optimus and Megatron sound like college football players?

Transformers One,2024-04-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> the irony in this statementüíÄ"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"when megatron asked: &quot;are you optimus prime because you&#39;re more than meet the eyes or are you more than meet the eyes because you&#39;re optimus prime?&quot; I truly felt that<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"You know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for me, an old-school fan, but honestly this is probably what Transformers needs to move forward and stay relevant with kids today. I has all the polish and style for today&#39;s audiences, and that&#39;s perfectly okay. It&#39;s not MY Transformers, but it doesn&#39;t have to be."
Transformers One,2024-04-19,This movie is basically gonna be like Guardians of the galaxy but with Transformers...
Transformers One,2024-04-19,I just realized that Bumblebee in his new upgraded looks like his original G1 Goldbug character. How are people not talking about this and flooding this comment section mentioneing this? I thought this was something obscure from the original G1 continuity that og fans would be obsessed and overloaded about. The design even has the blue visor and more squared off shaping and flat lines rather than the original horns or curved antenna and swooped back race helmet design.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,One question that I keep asking with new transformers media is &quot; will Grimlock be there?&quot;
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"First time Optimus has had a smile on his face since dark of the moon, rise of the beasts, and transformers prime"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Orion and D-16 look like really are great friends hope nothing tragic happens to their friendship
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"Chris Hemsworth‚Äôs American Accent doesn‚Äôt sound bad at all.<br><br>Edit: For those who keep saying this is a terrible voice for Optimus, of course he‚Äôll never be Peter Cullen, but Chris Hemsworth has a badass voice. He could easily make Optimus sound badass if he wanted to. Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron is the only terrible miscasting decision in this film imo."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> why is this so funny üòÇ<br>And when bumble bee runs"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Megatron&#39;s design here reminds me of his design in the G1 Marvel comics. I like that.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Transformers: War for Cybertron  and Transformers: Fall of Cybertron remain as my favorite pieces of Transformers media. If you dont like this movie try playing those games instead they&#39;re so much better. If you dont beleive me watch the trailer for FOC.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,The Bionicles are finally getting the respect they deserve.
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"As an actual life-long TF fan I&#39;m noticing little bits of pretty deep and obscure Transformers lore  sprinkled throughout this trailer (Megatronus, the Quintessons, Alpha Trion). The people making this know TF well and I have a feeling this is going to be really genuine and deliver the deep emotional TF story we&#39;ve been wanting .<br><br>I think the knee-jerk negative reaction is due to the aesthetic returning to the G1 cartoon/TFA style. People who got into the franchise with the bay-verse will need to adjust but I i think having a character-driven story (or god forbid a story at all) will be worth it."
Transformers One,2024-04-18,I just realised Bee&#39;s battlemask looks very similar to his OG Goldbug form. Nice
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"This is where all cybertrnians fighting against their creators the quintieesons and before the first great war between the Autobots and Decepticons. Plus, I don&#39;t know when Orion Pax and D-16 will become Optimus Prime and Megatron. I guess Hasbro wanted to show the first Cybertronian Civil War"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Michael Bay is probably crying in the corner of his house üò≠
Transformers One,2024-04-20,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rmJXXKDrsM&amp;t=118"">1:58</a> Wheels I need Wheels (Bumblebee 2024)"
Transformers One,2024-04-18,Am I the only one that thinks this looks dope? I feel like hemsworth does a great job sounding like a ‚Äúnew‚Äù Peter Cullen. You can tell he worked with him and a voicing coach
Transformers One,2024-04-18,"I hate that every movie in theatres needs to have celebrity actors. A movie doesn&#39;t need to have celebrity voice actors to be good, I&#39;m still going to watch it."
Transformers One,2024-04-20,"True Transformer Fans: Till all are One.<br><br>Noticed everyone has mixed views it&#39;s ok, please please respect each other alright. It&#39;s more transformer content, this will help appeal to new and old ok. Older fans know the origins why not help educate the newer generation.<br><br>Stay positive and safe everyone. :)"

Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,His physical transformation for this role for both weight and character portrayal is commendable.......
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-09-20,I hope Joker 2 wasn‚Äôt a mistake. Joker 1 was just so good.

Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-24,This is how a trailer should be. Studios take note. They didn&#39;t show the whole damn movie in a trailer and it was still great!
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,‚ÄúWhen Gotham is ashes ‚Ä¶ then you have my permission to sing.‚Äù
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,I think Joaquin Phoenix could make history in winning winning his second Oscar for playing the exact same role. That would be epic!
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,Love it when trailes are actually uploaded in 4K!
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OKAwz2MsJs&amp;t=124"">2:04</a> It&#39;s such a small thing, but that little turn he does after Harley says &quot;It&#39;s ok, baby&quot; feels SO MUCH like the Joker to me... like, it&#39;s not a natural turn you&#39;d see a normal person do - it feels like it&#39;s choreographed, i.e. it&#39;s an act that he&#39;s putting on, so it&#39;s like a subtle sign that even though he may not look it, he&#39;s in total control of what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s weird to say, but that one little turn kinda gave me chills."
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-08-02,THIS IS HOW YOU DO A TRAILER! For once i didn&#39;t finish it feeling like I watched the whole movie.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,The court scene looks like it&#39;s going to be as Oscar worthy as the monologue with him and Murray Franklin.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-10-03,This makes this movie look so good even though it‚Äôs not
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,"As someone who wasn&#39;t a fan when they announced this movie as a musical, this trailer really sells why this works. They are two crazy people who just bust out into songs to describe the situation. It fits their characters really well."
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-24,"There are 6 actors that got nominated for the same role but none of them have won, Joaquin phoenix would make history if he won 2nd time as Joker."
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-24,That Joker Smile. Joaquin Phoenix is a phenomenal actor!
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-08-01,"Director Todd Phillips said it isn&#39;t a musical, as had been rumoured, but that music is &quot;an essential element&quot;<br><br>Edit : SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,"The way Joker looks at Harley at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OKAwz2MsJs&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> felt very Joker<br>The deadpan stare, like he almost forgot she was there, and she just interrupted his moment<br>But then still smiles at her remark, plays along with her, before returning his attention to his audience"
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,My jaw is gonna be on the floor for another hour... That&#39;s one of the greatest trailers I&#39;ve ever seen.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-25,I love that they didn‚Äôt reveal the story of the movie in the trailer. Too many modern trailers are just recaps of the entire movie. But this told you just enough without giving away the plot but enough to grab your interest.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,"Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. What a duo! This is going to make a ridiculous amount of money again, and it deserves every penny."
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,OK. Setting the movie aside for one minute.<br>Whoever edited and composed this trailer should get a freaking award for just that. Its perfect. And really I won&#39;t watch any other trailer. They should have stopped with just this teaser. Anymore more would give too much away. This is the perfect level and what a trailer should do.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-30,‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel so alone anymore.‚Äù
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-24,This is how you cut a trailer. Had me hyped without knowing what happens. Absolutely stoked for this.
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-23,Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are going to give one of the best acting duo of the year. So happy to see them in a movie together üôå
Joker: Folie √† Deux,2024-07-25,I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 5 years since the original released!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,These movies going from like‚Ä¶ student film quality to actual movies you see in the theater is forever the biggest glow up &lt;3
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"A 35,000 dollar budget from terrifier 1 to a 2 million dollar budget with this is insane, can‚Äôt wait"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Whoever put this trailer together deserves a raise.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Watching the terrifier franchise grow up is a miracle. Literally the passed on generation of a cult classic!
Terrifier 3,2024-09-12,"I love that Art doesn&#39;t have a signature weapon. He&#39;ll use anything: chainsaw, knife, table leg with nails, gun, scissors, beer bottle."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,You know how a lot of us horror fans look back on horror franchises with nostalgia? We are witnessing a franchise grow right before our eyes and we need to cherish these moments!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"Whether you love these movies or hate them, watching the jump in production quality from the original to this is nothing but admirable. That first film was held together with duct tape and elbow grease, while this looks like a theater-quality release (I know Terrifier 2 released in theaters, but it still had a bit of a cheap look to it). It&#39;s cool to see that kind of evolution, especially from a team that&#39;s so committed to practical effects and old-school movie making"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,"35,000 dollar to 250,000 dollar TO FRICKING 5 Million DOLLARS! Keep killing it Damien keep making more we love it."
Terrifier 3,2024-09-04,You know it‚Äôs gonna be brutal when the trailer itself is gory
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"I‚Äôve been a Terrifier fan for a long time, words can‚Äôt imagine how proud I am. The first Terrifier was a experimental film, no one knew if it would become a full series, now we‚Äôre here with a 3rd one coming out with Art as the greatest modern horror antagonist"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,WE THROWING UP IN THEATERS WITH THIS ONEüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Terrifier 3,2024-09-03,This is the only movie I plan on seeing in the theater this year. I want to support this franchise.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"Can‚Äôt wait!  I just met David Howard Thornton this past weekend and he says, ‚Äúthe first five minutes are insanely intense‚Äù"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,The shimmy as he eats the cookies üòÇ
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Art is back! He‚Äôs come a long way since all hallows eve. Its nice to see him becoming more well known.
Terrifier 3,2024-09-08,"And to think, the first movie was close to never being made. Man, and now we are almost 3 movies in! Cant wait"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"As an 80&#39;s kid, these movies bring back the good old quality of slasher movies, and with the supernatural aspects. Story slowly unfolds throughout each movie about the character(s). Art is perfect, says nothing, like Jason from Friday the 13th, and Michael Myers from Halloween. Those things make shit more erie. No dialog, just brute force and focus. Hyped ASF for Terrifier 3."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,brooke being back in this for a possible dream/ hallucination sequence gon eat up
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Literally the only movie I&#39;ve been waiting for this year.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,"I met David Howard Thornton twice and he is the nicest guy in the world, and so is Damien Leone, they&#39;re like a family, like when Evil Dead started out"
Terrifier 3,2024-09-03,I have a premonition that this series will become a classic in film and televisionÔºå
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Whoever made and edited this trailer did a great job! Didn‚Äôt reveal too many of the kills so props to them! Can‚Äôt wait.
Terrifier 3,2024-10-02,"That growing smile at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPcin5knJk&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> is perfection"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,That shot of art sitting down enjoying his cookies is worthy of being one of the most iconic scenes in movie history imho.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,Art has already been steadily blowing up since T2 dropped... but T3 is when Art becomes an official horror ICON!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Art is such a huge horror icon now. And I‚Äôm all here for it! (In my opinion)
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"So proud of Damien man, this stuff was never supposed to be the next big horror series. ü§ò"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"My last comment on this trailer but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPcin5knJk&amp;t=104"">1:44</a> where art chopped the door with the axe and is looking through the door, the shining influence is huge! Thank you Damien for this."
Terrifier 3,2024-09-03,I have a premonition that this series will become a classic in film and television
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,so art the clown is now a killer santa clown this is gonna be so good
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"As a slasher movie genre lover, this is my most anticipated movie of 2024."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,I could feel the parents fear when their kids was running up to Art thinking it was Santa
Terrifier 3,2024-09-01,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPcin5knJk&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> the way art shows up his face after terrifier 2 is literally the best comeback moment"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"yes!!!i saw terrifier 2 ,9 times...each time was...just perfect! now..now i need this part 3 ...sure i need that...we all need that...we all need part 4 ,5,6!!!"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,There are no words for just how excited i truly am.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,Art is carrying the horror torch now
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,I‚Äôve watched the trailer like seven times now <br><br>This is going to be the wildest horror movie ever
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,"Last year I got the opportunity to meet  David Howard Thornton in person, shake his hand, and thank him for the great work he‚Äôs done. I am beyond excited for this film."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"I myself have not been a fan of the Terrifier movies. But I have to admit, &quot;Terrifier 3&quot;, despite it&#39;s immense brutalness,does actually look good. Excellent construction of this trailer. To be fair, Art The Clown makes Pennywise look like Ronald McDonald and very famous beloved horror icons like Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky, Leatherface, and Pinhead look like damn trimmed down PG 13 characters. And I thought Saw was brutal... I&#39;ll make an exception for this one. Art is really about to deck the halls..."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,This looks more intense than part 2! Damien Leone strikes again!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"I&#39;m happy to see Terrifier again, I&#39;ve been following their movies since 2019 and I really appreciate them. &lt;3"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"I&#39;m loving Art&#39;s facial expressions more in this one; he looks even more over the top, and I&#39;m all here for it!"
Terrifier 3,2024-09-01,The perfect christmas movie to spread the holiday cheer!üéÑ‚ú®
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,It&#39;s gonna be crazy...‚ò†Ô∏è
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"To think I watched terrifier 1 on a whim so many years ago, to being able to watch part 2 in theaters now with this one looking like it‚Äôs gonna be most balls to the wall movie in the series yet is so damn HYPE üòÇüî•"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,The little shimmy he does at the end is everything. Can&#39;t wait for this!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,Considering I‚Äôve been a fan since the first Terrifier. Man it actually makes me tear up a little to see them reach this level of success üñ§
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"&quot;Christmas Comes Early This Year&quot; What a line, holy crap!"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-30,It‚Äôs actually heartwarming to be able to see a series grow this much over time
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"Terrifier 2 was really good, great music too. Especially dark dreams."
Terrifier 3,2024-09-05,This is the franchise we need for our generation and it will go down in history just like our parents franchises did
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Could be the best one in the Franchise and The most disturbing one
Terrifier 3,2024-09-01,"Terrifier 2 is the best horror movie ever in my opinion, followed by house of 1000 corpses. The world has needed a new great horror villain. We haven&#39;t seen any new great villains like Freddy, Jason, myers, etc for like 30+ years."
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Art the clown is already iconic probably one of the best newer characters created.  This movie looks amazing.
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"Terrifier&#39;s potential is amazing, can&#39;t wait"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,"Black Christmas, silent night , the shinning type of vibe yoooo"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,This might be the best one yet from the trailer‚Ä¶ SO EXCITED!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPcin5knJk&amp;t=61"">1:01</a> dang that scream was something!"

Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPcin5knJk&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> art save me a cookie"
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,Dude the shower scene looks wild!! Can‚Äôt wait!!
Terrifier 3,2024-08-28,I&#39;m not getting a good vibe from the mall scene; I predict Art&#39;s going to hand out either severed heads/body parts or time bombs
Terrifier 3,2024-09-26,I remember watching Terrifier 1 4 years ago and I really liked it despite its low budget. Now part 3 is coming out and part 4 is in progress? Wow great job
Terrifier 3,2024-08-29,Yaaay they even cast the former actress again! I loved her in the second movie!!!! Can‚Äôt wait to see it!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Challengers,2023-06-21,Zendaya has played her transition into adult roles so well. She has proven time and time again how flexible and versatile she is. I‚Äôm so excited for this movie!!
Challengers,2023-06-20,I remember when I first seen Zendaya on the Disney channel and thinking she actually has a lot of talent‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been incredible to see her grow as an actress and all around performer. I think she‚Äôs amazing and this looks like outside her comfort zone.
Challengers,2023-09-04,She went from KC under cover to Kc under the covers üò≠üò≠üò≠
Challengers,2023-06-20,This film takes the U.S. <b>OPEN</b> to a whole new level. These dudes must‚Äôve been a great <b>doubles</b> team.
Challengers,2023-06-20,"Now this is a role that takes her out of her moody, dry, awkward teenager role she plays in everything else. <br><br>Very mature movie. This may just really showcase the talent she‚Äôs already been awarded for having in her other roles."
Challengers,2023-06-27,Zendaya getting tag teamed. How empowering. You go girl!
Challengers,2023-06-20,That‚Äôs why Tom accept it now.. ‚Äúbeing Spider-Man is a sacrifice!‚ÄùüòÖ

Challengers,2023-06-23,Josh O&#39;Connor is so good at that accent I actually did a double take when I saw him! This looks so good!!
Challengers,2023-06-21,This can only mean two things- either Zendaya is really stepping up her game or that she is making Tom Holland cry.
Challengers,2023-07-14,"Although yes they show the whole plot of a movie in trailers now a days, im still excited to see zendaya ,she has quickly worked her way up my personal list of favorite actresses"

Nosferatu,2024-10-02,Nostalgic film.<br>I&#39;ve waited 102 years for this movie.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"&quot;Standing before me was death, but I have never been so happy&quot;<br>What a line"
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,Willem Dafoe always looks like he&#39;s having an absolute blast with his roles and I love him for it.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,&#39;&#39;You could never please me as he could&#39;&#39; - Nah! She is for the cobblestones pathways.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Doing what horror movie trailers should always do. Never show the monster.
Nosferatu,2024-10-02,the shadow of the hand reaching over the town is absolutely insane
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,That curtain shot is masterful
Nosferatu,2024-12-01,"From night shift manager at the Krusty Krab to Hollywood actor, Nosferatu sure had a career glow"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Glad that they still didn&#39;t show him.<br>Can&#39;t wait for the reveal in cinema.
Nosferatu,2024-12-12,A trailer that doesn&#39;t show the entire movie? Love this!
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,the perfect dark gothic horror movie can‚Äôt wait
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Eggers deciding to update the use of shadows from the original is making me very happy. There‚Äôs no way this doesn‚Äôt get at least a cinematography nomination next year at the Oscars.
Nosferatu,2024-12-12,The shadow hand over the city goes unfathomably hard
Nosferatu,2024-10-16,Robert Eggers is just so darn talented. I&#39;m glad there&#39;s so many people out there that truly appreciate his work.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"I swear there needs to be more gothic horror being made, this just looks exquisite to me. This is how you can make horror and dread something beautiful in my opinion.<br><br>Edit: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> are my favorite little scenes from this trailer, they look so amazing."
Nosferatu,2024-12-24,I wonder if he&#39;s going to be flickering the lights like in Spongebob lol
Nosferatu,2024-10-02,Now THAT&#39;S how you make a good horror trailer.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Ahhh yes... the long awaited origin story of the Hash Slinging Slasher
Nosferatu,2024-12-08,Robert Eggers is to horror what Denis Villeneuve is to science fiction. So happy with the new generation of directors who love and breathe their craft. We all benefit from such talent.
Nosferatu,2024-10-18,My local cinema is showing the original Nosferatu for Halloween. I can‚Äôt wait to finally see it on a big screen.
Nosferatu,2024-12-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> &quot;Its desire is to consume all life on earth.&quot; Starting by stalking a random woman in a small village in the middle of nowhere. &quot;Today, What&#39;s-her-name. Tomorrow, the world.&quot;"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"‚ÄúWait if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then‚Ä¶ Who was Fliccchering the lights??‚Äù"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Gave us more but didn&#39;t show Orlok&#39;s design. Just as I hoped.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Not a horror fan cause it gives me nightmares, but im glad they decided to send this project to Focus Features instead of Blumhouse to let the quality prevail instead of treating it as a cashgrab. Somehow I&#39;m curious to watch it. (Might not for sleep&#39;s sake)"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,<b>Can&#39;t wait for the rumored Krusty Krab cameo.</b>
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Every director has a movie where they were born to make that movie. Nosferatu is the movie that Robert Eggers was born to make. His directing style fits so perfectly for the atmosphere and visuals of the story
Nosferatu,2024-11-12,"Lights *flicker<br>Everyone: &quot;is that you&quot;<br>Nosferatu: üòä"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"SpongeBob and Squidward are so proud of of him, he finally made it to the big leagues."
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,"Thanks to Spongebob I&#39;d never take Nosferatu seriously, but this might change that. Maybe"
Nosferatu,2024-10-25,"After seeing the Northman, I can&#39;t imagine how deep into the lore it&#39;s going to get for this movie. Holy crap. Robert Edgar&#39;s is a genius when it comes to this stuff"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Ah yes, Christmas movie about a vampire killing people with the trailer posted during spooky month"
Nosferatu,2024-10-21,Dracula has been done countless tines..This looks like the slow burn dread that makes the Novel so horrific. This trailer really captures everything I want to see in a vampire movie
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,I&#39;m so beyond pumped for this! The glimpses of Count Orlok are just chilling on their own. I can&#39;t imagine how terrifying he&#39;ll be when we properly see him.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"You know, I&#39;m something of a vampire hunter myself."
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,It looks like mix between coppola&#39;s dracula and classic nosferatu.
Nosferatu,2024-10-15,"I feel like this story is about dark temptation. Especially that one line she says ‚Äústanding before me was death, and yet I had never been more happy‚Äù <br>It‚Äôs about knowing your desires are wrong and cursed but not being able to fight them<br>Edit: when I wrote this comment I was unfamiliar with Gothic Horror and it‚Äôs themes. Since then I‚Äôve watched Nosferatu and looked more into the history. I now know that my comment wasn‚Äôt a huge revelation haha, it was just me subconsciously learning about gothic literature! I love it!"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Knowing Eggers, this will be extremely historically accurate aside from the vampire"
Nosferatu,2024-10-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=10"">0:10</a> This looks SO similar to the carriage scene from Bram stoker&#39;s Dracula that for a moment i thought it was another edited fan trailer."
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Robert Eggers + Jarin Blaschke + Willem Dafoe = Dreamteam
Nosferatu,2024-10-06,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> We missed such creative scenes."
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"I hate that nobody really saw the Northman, one of the best movies of that year. This looks amazing!"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Robert Eggers is a brilliant filmmaker. Looking forward to it!
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> The Focus Features logo for Nosferatu is amazing!"
Nosferatu,2024-10-06,Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922) I&#39;ve watched this masterpiece. Hope they do justice to this legendary tale in this movie. Really excited for this one.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Nosferatu about to get freaky in more ways than one
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Absolutely peak Gothic Horror as huge fan of vampires, and for me Dracula 1992 this is absolutely beautiful moment. Thank you Robert Eggers for bringing it! üò¢"
Nosferatu,2024-10-06,"Robert Eggers has shown us already his mastery of light and dark, of shadows, of atmosphere, dread."
Nosferatu,2024-12-05,"Reviews are calling it a masterpiece and Robert Egger‚Äôs best film yet.   I consider The Witch and The Northman to be masterpieces, so I can‚Äôt wait!"
Nosferatu,2024-12-04,Wow! A faithful remake that looks unique and well written?! Take notes Disney
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,That shot at the end ATEEEE
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Words cannot describe how excited I am for this film. Robert Egger&#39;s is the only director who I will guarantee go to a midnight release for; loved seeing the Northman, most recently. Here&#39;s to another awesome film."
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"Hey, we&#39;re making a horror movie. Ok, hire Bill Skarsgard! üòÇ"
Nosferatu,2024-10-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> that shot is crazy."
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,Nosferatu is a horror masterpiece and can&#39;t wait for this version.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"I just watched The VVitch for the first time the other day. That was a horror movie acting masterclass. This movie looks like it is doing it yet again under Robert Eggers. Also, I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt show his face again like the first trailer. Just tease that horrifying presence of his‚Ä¶"

Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"A legendary movie that was almost destroyed by a copyright claim now gets a remake. Do you see the irony, Youtube?"
Nosferatu,2024-10-04,Finally a vampire movie that will be as good as Interview with the Vampire 1994.
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,YES YES YES!!! My favorite film maker who‚Äôs made 3 10/10 movies! Guaranteed this one will be a masterpiece as well just like his others!
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,"Hearing all the people scream towards the end but not seeing anybody really be killed has me so curious what this movie has in store, they&#39;re doing a great job at saving the important reveals for the cinemas, most anticipated movie of the year for me!"
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,The Witch walked so Nosferatu could run.
Nosferatu,2024-09-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k&amp;t=10"">0:10</a> Lestat would be blushing"
Nosferatu,2024-12-05,"Nosferatu was just protecting us from the real monster here, the hash flinging, the flash singing"
Nosferatu,2024-11-29,They show just enough to pull you in. The way trailers used to be. Great job. I&#39;m excited for this one. 102 years after the original. Let&#39;s go!!
Nosferatu,2024-12-16,I am PRAYYYYING that Eggers recreates the scene where Count Orlock is ascending the staircase but all you see is his shadow. So freakin iconic.
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready.‚Äù <br>That is the understatement of the year. I want this movie so GODDAMN much!
Nosferatu,2024-10-01,I don&#39;t need to watch the movie to witness a Master at his craft. Eggers always exceeds all expectations. Although I can&#39;t wait for this holiday gift! üòÅüòÅ

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-09-20,"Now I know where The Flash&#39;s budget went but seriously, &quot;Aquaman 2 and the Lost Kingdom&quot; looks incredible throughout Black Manta looks impressive, Arthur is still BADASS and Orm is cool but the best thing is that Atlantis looks beautiful and GOD (just like the first movie üíô) and I can&#39;t wait to see it in December üòÆ"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2024-01-04,"The movie was amazing ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§Don‚Äôt listen to those insecure cyberbullies, let them barküòÇüòÇüòÇ"

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-22,"honestly i do not care if Heard is here or not. She did her role pretty well in he first Aquaman and to me, her performance made the movie fun too. Like can people just get their heads out of the who-did-what and just enjoy the movie? Its not like she‚Äôs the protagonist anyway! Aquaman is a good franchise so as long as it‚Äôs a good movie then‚Äî really, who cares? People are just pointing fingers trying to erase someone completely. I think it‚Äôs great that DC just minimized her screen time rather than deleting her out altogether cause idk but that feels too unnatural to watch and I‚Äôm not a fan of it either. She really isn‚Äôt much of a big deal so people should stop taking her seriously. Ppl are saying this is the last movie so fr can‚Äôt we just enjoy this one"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-26,"If you look for excitement, good graphics, cool actions and pure fun only without too much thinking, then the movie is surely the one."

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2024-01-27,Heard is in the movie.<br>Who else felt like walking out?
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-11-21,Very little Amber in the trailer...I bet feminists ARE protesting this film!!
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-09-20,"Unlike the flash which had some good moments but overall tried to hard to please fans, this just looks like a blast, it knows what it is and just seems to have fun with itself while also delivering on the big spectacle action it promised us like the first one."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-30,I genuinely enjoyed it.<br><br>The visuals alone are worth seeing on the big screen.<br><br>The characters are likable.<br><br>The story has epic parts.<br><br>Feel like a 90&#39;s movie with modern graphics. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-26,"I can&#39;t believe, amber heard not completely removed???"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-11-25,"I think the American people already spoke about this film with a petition, that was passed as bots. Now we speak with our wallets. And not to mention, we‚Äôre sick of BAD WRITING not superhero fatigue. So again ignore if you must."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2024-07-19,This is definitely one of the trailers I&#39;ve seen during my life so far
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-25,"The movie is awesome!‚ù§I watched today in IMAZ 3D Laser, and can&#39;t wait to watch it again in streaming.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2024-01-22,Sorry Jason Momoa but this movie was a hard pass. if Amber Heard wasn&#39;t in it I would have watched it but I have morals.....
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,2023-12-20,I have no idea why people hate Amber so much. I watched this movie today and the movie was good and she was good there too. Isn&#39;t an actress job to act well? Why do people care so much of her personal life? She didn&#39;t commit any crime you know.

Argylle,2023-09-28,"THIS is what a trailer should be. Just enough of the plot depicted to let the viewer know what the movie is basically about and get them interested, but not too much that it spoils the entire plot. And it had great music with cuts that perfectly run alongside with the music, and a beat that kept the trailer going instead of getting boring all while enticing the viewer to want more by the end; which is ultimately the goal of every trailer."
Argylle,2023-10-18,This looks like just plain fun and I think the casting is great. These are the kinds of movies that Hollywood needs to make more of nowadays
Argylle,2023-09-28,Vaughn is a genius. He should be the one to work on an Archer movie with Cavill. The cat will have a big plot twist for sure
Argylle,2023-09-29,I so badly want this to be huge. I love the whole cast.
Argylle,2023-09-28,Real happy that Catherine O‚ÄôHara is starting to consistently appear in major films again.<br><br>Film itself looks real sweet too and I hope it doesn‚Äôt disappoint.
Argylle,2023-09-28,Nothing like the feeling of seeing a trailer for an original movie that intrigues you yet doesn‚Äôt spoil a lot. Looks great. Can‚Äôt wait!
Argylle,2023-09-29,It looks like a fun film with a great cast
Argylle,2023-12-18,"I get so excited seeing movies like this. Not based on an existing IP, not too serious, not part of a cinematic universe. Just a joy ride. Hollywood used to tell unique stories like this.<br><br>Hoping it‚Äôs not a generic movie like Red Notice. It doesn‚Äôt seem so. It‚Äôs got a unique twist."
Argylle,2023-09-28,I can&#39;t remember the last time I enjoyed a spy movie trailer this much. Had the biggest smile on my face!!
Argylle,2023-09-28,Seeing this trailer made me realise how much Matthew Vaughn will be perfect for an Archer movie. With Henry Cavill as Sterling.
Argylle,2023-09-28,"I love espionage movies, especially Vaughn&#39;s movies they&#39;re just soo fun to watch and the cast in this one is absolutely incredible!"
Argylle,2023-12-03,"This is the first time in years that I have seen a trailer and actually want to go to the cinema to watch the film. An amazing cast, and I love Matthew Vaughn&#39;s Kingsman series- cannot wait until its release in February!!"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, Bryan Cranston, John Cena and more...whoa what a star-studded cast! can&#39;t wait for February already!!"
Argylle,2023-09-28,Sam Rockwell is definititely an underrated actor so it&#39;s good to see him in other movies. Also the plot kind of reminds me of the movie &quot;Stranger than fiction&quot;
Argylle,2023-09-29,"Now this looks delightful. Fun, actiony, and doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously."
Argylle,2023-11-19,When I saw the thumbnail I thought this was going to be a lighthearted story about a spoiled cat that gets lost and has to go on a quest to return to its doting owner.  When I realized it wasn&#39;t I was so disappointed. The fact that by the end of this trailer I was looking forward to the movie again is extremely impressive.  We need more movies with fun these days.<br><br>...And technically I wasn&#39;t wrong about that cat going on an adventure.
Argylle,2023-09-28,This cast is insane
Argylle,2023-10-09,Am I the only one in love with the music choices in this trailer? Hope the film has the same taste
Argylle,2023-09-28,"The cast is so freaking good, Henry Cavill is back baby.....and suspicious minds playing in the background.....made my day. ‚ù§üòä"

Argylle,2023-10-19,"an actual movie that looks watchable? Been dying to get back into the theater. Nice job Universal, keep them coming."

Argylle,2023-09-30,Always a joy when Sam Rockwell is involved üéâ
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Matthew Vaughn has a history of making movies that are unbelievably fun and entertaining, especially the action packed ones. Plus, when I saw Dua Lipa I was already on board! üòÉ"
Argylle,2023-10-03,"See now this a film that is ESSENTIAL to have in cinemas and not on a streaming service day one. This film looks amazing visually, the cast is top tier, and the story looks unique."
Argylle,2023-09-30,This is an exceptionally well cut trailer. Of particular note is the audio. If you listen without watching you can hear the editor&#39;s immense skill at work.
Argylle,2023-09-28,I just clicked the video because of the cat in the thumbnail but didn&#39;t think I would be blown away by this amazing trailer üëå
Argylle,2023-09-28,Holy hell this is ambitious and looks fun af. We are in for it Universal!
Argylle,2023-09-28,This looks like everything I ever wanted it to be. It&#39;s like Stranger Than Fiction meets Kingsmen! <br>Vaughn is one of the best with incredibly fun action sequences!
Argylle,2023-09-28,"This movie is going to be fire....the characters, the plot, the sounds...this is going to be epic"
Argylle,2023-09-28,Argylle is gonna be the spy version of The Lost City!
Argylle,2023-09-29,I want this version of Suspicious Minds so bad - so epic in this trailer!
Argylle,2023-09-28,"I&#39;m usually not big on spy movies, but this looks like so much fun and I am excited to watch it when it comes out ü§©"
Argylle,2023-09-28,I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre leaving the cat stuff a mystery. It looks like a fun film with a great cast!
Argylle,2023-09-30,Love how Bryce Dallas Howard is finally playing a good character again<br>Unlike the mean ones that she always plays in like The Help and Rocketman
Argylle,2023-09-28,Looks like a lot of fun!! Great cast and interesting premise
Argylle,2024-01-24,Gotta love Vaughns movies.  Turns a dramatic actor into an action movie badass and films are always entertaining.
Argylle,2023-09-30,"I was hooked, jebaited, surprised, thrilled, awed, and now, most important, HIGHLY INVESTED to see this movie! The cast is shocking, the plot sounds intriguing, and the overall tone feels immaculate. Haven&#39;t felt this hyped about a trailer since Joker."
Argylle,2023-09-28,"It looks like it&#39;s going to be the perfect balance of action and humor, I can&#39;t wait till tickets go on sale. Looks like you put out another great one Mr. Vaughn"
Argylle,2023-11-18,"I so hope that this movie lives up to the hype I felt watching this trailer. The plot seems interesting, the actors are all great, the humor is on point and the visuals look stunning so here&#39;s crossing my fingers that it doesn&#39;t disappoint!"
Argylle,2023-10-19,"This looks like it will be a blast!  Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Bryce Dallas Howard, Samuel L Jackson, John Cena - all in a Matthew Vaughan film?  I‚Äôm in!"
Argylle,2023-09-30,You had me at Sam Rockwell. This trailer put a huge smile on my face.

Argylle,2023-09-28,"Excited to see Dua Lipa, not sure about henry cavill hair though üòÇ."
Argylle,2023-09-28,After watching this trailer<br>I think that Henry Cavill really has to be the next James Bond
Argylle,2023-09-29,John Cena is the reason why I will be watching this movie!
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Superman, peacemaker, walter white, gwen stacy, and nick fury in one movie together"
Argylle,2023-09-28,This is cast is S Tier and it‚Äôs from Matthew Vaughn??? Yeah I‚Äôm in love I need to see this movie now
Argylle,2024-01-05,"This really  reminds me of that action movie with Sandra bullock as an author who gets abducted by Daniel Radcliff to find an archeological treasure- I love that we&#39;re doing action movies that feel like the set up of a romance novel (the same way there&#39;s a ton of movies about screenwriters, there&#39;s loads of novels about authors)"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Just from the trailer, I have to say that this movie looks like a total BLAST! I can&#39;t wait to see it!"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"I have to admit, that this trailer blew my sh*t away. Never been so hyped about a movie from seeing just a trailer!!!"

Argylle,2023-09-28,This is truly genius! And that is a masterpiece for a new Spy Movie!
Argylle,2023-09-29,"The Cast guys is just impeccable. Brian Cranston, Catherine O Hara, Henry Cavil, Dula Peep, John Cena."
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Damn!! What a cast!! This looks so good! Love watching a Matthew Vaughn movie, he never disappoints."
Argylle,2023-09-28,"This actually looks so good. Like this cast is absolutely stacked, Superman, Nick Fury and Walter White üî•üî•"

Argylle,2023-09-28,The background music is even more wild and heightens the drama. Overall this trailer is a blast!
Argylle,2023-10-06,This is a phenomenal trailer crafted so perfectly that the trailer itself becomes the perfect cliffhanger for the movie that is about to come. And the star cast is just amazing... and Henry Cavil looks amazing. I do hope that he gets to work with creators who are not driven by any external agenda and are really true to the stories which is due to the story. <br>And the cat....
Argylle,2023-09-28,This is one hell of a cast! Vaughn sure knows how to make fun movies.
Argylle,2023-09-30,"First time in a LONG time i am excited for a movie. An original idea, not some garbage remake or sequel, hope it does well"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"Such a interesting concept/story, I dig it!"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"You see!!! Henry Cavill may not be the next James Bond, but I guess he&#39;s ‚ù§kinda already James Bond. I mean, he was already in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Cannot get enough of him as this type of character. üòçü•∞He is the epitome of it. I ‚ù§Ô∏è it!"
Argylle,2023-09-28,"I love all the twists on the traditional genre. Also, it reminded me of the criminally underrated &quot;Mr. Right&quot; with Sam Rockwell. I love it!"
Argylle,2023-12-29,Having seen a bunch of Matthew Vaughn movies I&#39;m excited for this. The trailer gives off all the right vibes and matches with his style. And of course the cast looks phenomenal.

Argylle,2023-09-28,I love Henry but I can‚Äôt wait to see Sam Rockwell in this! I loved him in ‚ÄúMr Right‚Äù! He is brilliant in action and comedy!
Argylle,2023-09-28,This gives me really big vibes of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; where a romance author meets someone who is essentially the real version of her main character.
Argylle,2023-09-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mgu9mNZ8Hk&amp;t=126"">2:06</a> we&#39;re about to have another secret service styled head explosion scene, are we?"

Madame Web,2023-11-18,"the emotionless delivery of ‚Äúwho are you? what is going on?‚Äù which will inevitably be followed by exposition, dismantling the rule of ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù is exactly why this movie WILL be one of the movies of all time. no contest."

Trap,2024-04-19,The thing I love is typically people would say ‚Äúwell this movie gives away the whole plot‚Äù but you know damn well this man has a whole other level to this movie üíÄüî•
Trap,2024-04-18,I respect the fact that Shyamalan taking a break from the supernatural stuff and focusing on something that‚Äôs very simple
Trap,2024-04-21,He was a heartthrob when I was growing up now he&#39;s playing dad roles. I&#39;m old üòÇ
Trap,2024-04-20,He‚Äôs one original dude. Even when his movies don‚Äôt work you have to give him credit for pursuing his vision. Wish there were more directors like him in that way.
Trap,2024-05-04,"It&#39;s the daughter.<br>It&#39;s the singer.<br>It&#39;s a hidden sequel to Unbreakable.<br>It&#39;s 25,000 extras helping a psych patient to get over a trauma.<br>It&#39;s all of the above."
Trap,2024-04-19,M. Night and Josh Hartnett together?! The early 00‚Äôs are back
Trap,2024-06-05,Love seeing Josh Harnett in his comeback era. Such an underrated actor.
Trap,2024-04-18,"Regardless if it‚Äôll be great or bad, M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few major directors in Hollywood that is making original films for a major studio that can secure funding and great actors. And his films always feel like they‚Äôre his own creations where it doesn‚Äôt feel influenced by a studio. While he‚Äôs hit-and-miss (he‚Äôs made some awful films and some amazing films), I‚Äôm always down to see a new M. Night movie because I truly never know how I‚Äôm going to react until the theater lights go down. No two people are going to experience an M. Night movie the same way, and that‚Äôs pretty neat!"
Trap,2024-04-21,Josh Harnett as zeke in the faculty is one of the greatest characters of all time!!!
Trap,2024-04-26,"Most respect for Josh Hartnett. Was 1 movie away to become an A-lister, tuned down the part of superman just to avoid becoming a superstar, dished Hollywood to spend time with his family. Now i guess he&#39;s more comfortable to come back and have fun."
Trap,2024-04-19,"The fact that M.Night gave out this twist in the trailer, it means there&#39;s something more mind-blowing coming. I&#39;m definitely seeing this."
Trap,2024-05-14,"M. Night might not hit on ALL of his films, but that man sure knows how to keep his film original AF. Which is refreshing in the Ocean of Remakes, Reboots of Hollywood money grabbers. And to see Josh again after Nolan had him, great for him."
Trap,2024-05-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJiPAJKjUVg&amp;t=15"">0:15</a> the way he yells (mimics) &#39;&#39; I&#39;am sorry&#39;&#39; is a nice spot"
Trap,2024-04-18,The Josh Hartnet rebrand/comeback warms my heart. And he‚Äôs been killing it lately too
Trap,2024-04-18,"I am definitely intrigued. Plus, I&#39;m happy to see Josh Hartnett get a leading role for a big movie."
Trap,2024-04-21,Man props to M Night Shyamalan for consistently putting out original movies!
Trap,2024-04-20,"All these people not realizing Josh Hartnett has been back for awhile... Out of his most recent stuff, I&#39;m digging his dark roles. His episode in Black Mirror is freaking awesome and chilling. This looks to be just as great!"
Trap,2024-04-20,"I haven‚Äôt been invested in a trailer in so long, I actually want to go see this."
Trap,2024-04-18,I could not think of a better starring role for Josh Hartnett to really bring himself back into the spotlight. The dude is a solid actor and so I am rooting for his success here.üôèüèª
Trap,2024-04-21,"So happy to see Josh Hartnett in his first major-studio lead role in 17 years, since 30 Days of Night in 2007."
Trap,2024-04-19,"Shyamalan can be a hit or miss,  but his movies , more often than not, always feel fresh and original. I don&#39;t know of another movie with a concept like this."
Trap,2024-05-01,"Fun Fact: Lady Raven is M Night‚Äôs daughter. I‚Äôm from Philly and I‚Äôve seen her live, she‚Äôs talented and down to earth."
Trap,2024-04-19,I&#39;ve been rooting for Josh Hartnett and M Night Shyamalan. May their streak continue.
Trap,2024-04-19,Respect to Shyamalan...you just can&#39;t keep a good man down....Good to see Josh back..
Trap,2024-04-19,"I love how it shows the multitude of layers serial killers have, which helps them go unnoticed for so long too."
Trap,2024-04-20,Having a movie take place during a concert is an awesome concept
Trap,2024-04-25,Josh Hartnett for us 90&#39;s kids is an emotion.
Trap,2024-06-23,Nice to see Josh Harnett making his comeback after all these years!
Trap,2024-04-20,"I always admire Shyamalan for his persistence in trying to give us some attention-worthy movies, despite some issues that critics and fans have understandably had with some of his most recent endeavors.  And this certainly looks very promising."
Trap,2024-04-21,Just watched that Black Mirror episode where Hartnett was in space. Love the range on this guy‚Äî can‚Äôt wait to see this! üòä
Trap,2024-04-19,Just saw 30 days of night again and realize how long it‚Äôs been since I seen Josh harnett in a new movie. Hope this bangs he‚Äôs a dope actor
Trap,2024-04-18,"Like or hate Shyamalan, mad respect for his ideas and passion to create unique kind of movies"
Trap,2024-04-22,Loved this actor since the Faculty and 40 days and nights. Dude was a beast in Pearl Harbor. Jamies ending still sticks in my mind to this day. I want to see it just cause of Hartnett.
Trap,2024-04-18,"In a world of sequel, prequels, reboots, and remakes... gotta respect the director who&#39;s still making the fresh original movies. Thank you Mr. Shyamalan!"
Trap,2024-04-22,Happy to see josh harnet get the roles now. He&#39;s a good actor
Trap,2024-04-18,The PROTAGONIST IS THE DAMN KILLER OMG

Trap,2024-04-22,"Josh Hartnett is back, good to see him after such a long hiatus from the movie screen; this movie looks üî•"
Trap,2024-04-21,I&#39;m loving Josh Hartnet these days! So good to see him back!!! ‚ù§
Trap,2024-04-19,I&#39;m so Happy to See Josh Harnett back on his track. He is such a great actor
Trap,2024-04-22,"I must say, Hartnetts facial expressions are priceless"
Trap,2024-04-18,"Wow, that actually looked.... decent?! Knock at the Cabin was SO close, but fumbled at the finale. Hopefully this one sticks the landing."
Trap,2024-05-13,"This movie is gonna sell so much tickets, no matter how it turns out. The trailer is epic"
Trap,2024-04-20,It&#39;s refreshing to see Josh Hartnett&#39;s return to the spotlight after such a considerable hiatus.
Trap,2024-04-19,"Josh Harnett has done some GREAT Horror roles. Halloween, 30 days of night, the faculty, penny dreadful. It&#39;s good to see him come back to this and with M. Night directing! This is gonna be good üòà"
Trap,2024-04-22,Josh Hartnett!!! Making a comeback!!ü§òüèΩü§òüèΩ
Trap,2024-04-18,THE PROTAGONIST IS THE DAMN KILLER GENIUS
Trap,2024-04-18,Always show up on Day 1 for my man M Night   Shyamalan.
Trap,2024-04-19,what a concept.. HAVE TO GIVE IT TO M.NIGHT .. he always comes with the BEST CONCEPTS
Trap,2024-04-19,M. Night  is smarter than that to just give away the real twist. He showed what he showed but everyone knows he always has another twist . Excited to see where it goes
Trap,2024-04-18,Josh Hartnett as a villian!? I&#39;m here for it.
Trap,2024-04-20,"When they revealing the plot twist in trailer, You know that movie gonna be a Hit"
Trap,2024-04-20,Josh Harnett gives me &quot; 8 simple rules John Ritter&quot; Vibes in this trailer.   <br>Super stoked to see a very sinister version of Family Friendliness. <br>Can&#39;t wait for August to come soon.
Trap,2024-04-18,We&#39;re used to seeing M Night release a movie every Odd Numbered Year since 2013.<br><br>2013: After Earth<br>2015: The Visit<br>2017: Split <br>2019: Glass<br>2021: Old<br>2023: Knock at the Cabin
Trap,2024-05-03,First 30 seconds I was about to switch off ... then the hook ... now I&#39;m 100% all in.
Trap,2024-04-22,"Man, this movie feels like an instant classic! I keep coming back to this trailer, as I&#39;m literally mesmerized. The problem with M. Night movies was always the acting, but when he got that right, his movies went up to the awards. And this one, this one seems like one of the good ones. Hitchcock vibes, insane Hartnett performance and most likely some memorable twist."
Trap,2024-04-18,The fact M Nights‚Äôs daughter is a singer in real life though. Great way to introduce her to people that don‚Äôt know her üòÇüëåüèΩ
Trap,2024-04-20,Josh has been one of my favorites for a long time! I&#39;m so happy to see him again!
Trap,2024-04-18,"If anything else, I like that M. Night takes on original stories that he writes instead of just more sequels/remakes/big franchise or adaptation movies. Execution is all that matters in the end, originality won&#39;t count for much if it sucks, but originality is very much needed as a breath of fresh air for moviegoers (not counting indie movies, obviously, but it doesn&#39;t feel often we see original big-budget movies)."
Trap,2024-04-19,Josh Harnett as a serial killer and this is a trap for him in a lady raven concert . Love it. Nice to see him play the bad guy for once. I grow with this amazing actor.  I remember him I the faculty . I was a teenager when he start acting. This made me feel so old I will differently see this one .
Trap,2024-05-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJiPAJKjUVg&amp;t=41"">00:41</a> none of them actually recording really shows that this is a high quality film from WARNER BROS out of all the studios."
Trap,2024-05-30,"Although M. Night is a hit or miss, he never disappoints with his buildup to the movies. Genuinely couldn&#39;t wait longer for this one!"
Trap,2024-04-19,I don&#39;t know why no one is talking about the setup provided by the other guy. It gave me chills.<br>Also imagine if he is that FBI man who planned all of this to catch the butcher and letting him know that it&#39;s a trap. That would be another twister!!
Trap,2024-04-19,I‚Äôm so glad Josh Hartnett is back. One of my absolute favorites.
Trap,2024-04-18,"THANK YOU HOLLYWOOD FOR BRINGING BACK JOSH HARTNETT. He‚Äôs a good actor, grew up watching him since the early 2000s. Glad he‚Äôs coming back. Shout out to Nolan and Oppenheimer for casting him in a big movie"
Trap,2024-04-20,"Knowing M. Night, there&#39;s bound to be multiple twists we&#39;re not expecting. I am extremely excited to see this one."
Trap,2024-04-18,"For real though, Hartnett is one of the absolute best at playing psychopathic murderer roles.. Just an absolute beast &amp; it&#39;s been awesome watching his resurgence these last few projects.. Especially that role in Black Mirror alongside Mr. Pinkman himselfüòÇ"
Trap,2024-04-19,"Josh Harnett&#39;s comeback is refreshing! Not even mad about the trailer&#39;s twist reveal, M. Night surely has more surprises."
Trap,2024-07-13,"Ngl, this the most original movie idea I‚Äôve seen in quite some time. Good job M Night"
Trap,2024-04-19,"M.Nights films are so on their own wavelength, un-influenced by his contemporaries. I think thats probably why they always stick with me for ages"
Trap,2024-04-18,Josh Hartnett is one of my favorite actors. Im glad he is back.
Trap,2024-04-18,This one looks intriguing. I like how they give us the killer twist but leave you in suspense wondering what will happen. Might go see it in theaters
Trap,2024-04-19,I been chasing that M. Night Shyamalan high ever since The Sixth Sense.
Trap,2024-06-10,It&#39;s so nice to see Josh Harnett making his comeback

The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,2024-07-03,"I remember playing Gladys in my church‚Äôs production of this play. Man, this brings back so many memories. I loved Gladys. Such a little spunky and troublemaking little girl, shouting ‚ÄúSHAZAM‚Äù and pretending to hit the shepards while on stage. I loved the characters and authenticity and comical moments of the story. I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie and start shouting ‚ÄúSHAZAM‚Äù all over again during Christmas just to bug my parents. üòÇüòÖ"

Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Man! I love when James McAvoy makes horror movies. The guy can be frightening as hell.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Wow James McAvoy has almost completed his transformation into Gerard Butler!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I saw James McAvoy and I clicked so fast
Speak No Evil,2024-07-03,I barely recognized James McAvoy! He doesn&#39;t even look the same anymore. I still remember him the way he looked back in <i>X-Men First Class.</i>
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Thanks for showing us literally the whole movie guys
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,This film didn&#39;t need a remake. It&#39;s okay to have amazing international movies. Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake everything?
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,"James McAvoy is such an underrated actor. He should&#39;ve won an Oscar in my most honest and humbled opinion. Hopefully, this role and others can get him there!"
Speak No Evil,2024-09-04,James just keeps getting better.<br>A very rare quality in any artistic profession. Almost impossible to find among modern A list actors.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-22,James Mcvoy playing <i>that</i> character was great choice.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Halt and catch fire reunion and I am here for it. Plus James McAvoy is such a good actor and can play the crazy physco like no one else.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Me: How many plot twists can you spoil professionally? UP: yes
Speak No Evil,2024-08-21,I cannot WAIT to see this.  James McAvoy is one of THE most gifted actors of our time right now. I&#39;m so excited
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,The original film is brilliant. Real shame producers ruined the twist in this trailer. I doubt the ending won‚Äôt be as brutal
Speak No Evil,2024-04-16,"<b>They showed the entire movie in the trailer‚Ä¶every memorable moment, every twist..just go watch the original</b>"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,"I&#39;ve seen the original, they&#39;ve literally given away all the best parts of the film"
Speak No Evil,2024-06-20,I HAVEN&#39;T seen the original and yet I still feel like ive just had the entire movie spoiled for me üòÇ
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Im so proud of Daniel Hough for making a lead role in this film! Hes such a nice guy at school and everyone is so excited to see the film when it comes out
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"fire whoever put this trailer together, spoiling the whole movie"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"Another day another remake. Please watch the original everyone, its terrific."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy is gonna CRUSH this role I&#39;m so pumped!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"So, they gave away the whole movie in the trailer. Thank God I&#39;ve already seen and enjoyed the original. FFS. But I do have to say that I love the Halt and Catch Fire reunion!"
Speak No Evil,2024-05-02,I feel like a central theme of this movie is going to be how people get themselves into trouble under the pressure to just &quot;not be rude&quot;. Definitely gonna watch this one!!
Speak No Evil,2024-09-02,"I&#39;m just now hearing about this remake. The original Speak No Evil (2022) is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The fact James McAvoy (one of my favorite actors) is starring in the remake and it&#39;s being directed by the same director as Eden Lake (another one of my favorite horror movies, also starring Michael Fassbender funnily enough) has me really excited for this. Even if it&#39;s a shot for shot remake it&#39;ll still be a great movie, especially with James McAvoy in it. Can&#39;t wait."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,so nice to show the final twist of the film in the trailer.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,Crying because this is a mini reunion from Halt and Catch Fire with Scoot McNairy and Mackenzie Davis!! ‚ù§‚ù§
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"James is putting in that work apparently, dudes looking swole üí™üèª"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy deserves Oscar for his performance in SPLIT!!!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I had totally forgotten that there would be a remake of this film
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"I didn&#39;t need a remake of one of my fav horror movies of the past few years. But I love James,. Trailer spoiled it."
Speak No Evil,2024-06-18,James McAvoy one of the most exceptional actors. True masterclass
Speak No Evil,2024-04-15,"This film didn‚Äôt need a remake, the original was clearly good as enough"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-12,"the song at the beginning of the video is called &quot; Iniziamo dalla fine&quot; by Emma, a great italian singer. Listen to her"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"What made the original so remarkable and impactful was how bleak everything was. How ‚Äúnon-cinematic‚Äù it was crafted and real it felt. By the looks of it, they‚Äôre going to give us another sanitised version of the original story, because they can‚Äôt handle tragic stories that stick with you long after the credits roll. Reminds me of the car crash that was the Martyrs remake. Anyway, James McAvoy looks fit so I guess we have that to look forward to üòÇ"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-16,"As a huge fan of the tv series Halt and Catch Fire, seeing Scott McNairy and McKenzie Davis star alongside each other again after all these years brings tears to my eyes. They&#39;ll always be Gordon and Cameron to me"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-15,<b>Have seen the original Danish film. It&#39;s so engaging and shocking as much as traumatic. A must-watch. Hope the remake is as good as the original.</b>
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy is truly this generation&#39;s greatest actor.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"Great to see Scoot McNairy. An overlooked actor who is extremely talented and gives the best ‚Äúeveryday type man‚Äù performances. So easy to watch him work, really grounded actor."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,"James McAvoy is one of the best actors alive. He does not get enough credit. He is tied for my 2nd favorite with Cillian Murphy, has been since &quot;Split&quot;. My first lifelong favorite is Joaquin Phoenix. I have a sincere appreciation for talent."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-15,James McAvoy + Physcological Thrillers = A never ending love story
Speak No Evil,2024-04-15,"The original was so disturbing but I‚Äôm excited for a remake, especially James McAvoy he would be perfect thinking about it..can‚Äôt wait to see!"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy is guaranteed to deliver. He is such an incredible actor
Speak No Evil,2024-05-15,James McAvoy playing the antagonist is going to be wild!
Speak No Evil,2024-05-16,James McAvoy does an amazing job on any movie. His recent horror besides this movie was Split. That was a masterpiece.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"Well that was a full length <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjzxI6uf8H8&amp;t=175"">2:55</a> minute long movie I don&#39;t need to watch again."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-14,"&quot;Speak No Evil&quot; didn&#39;t need a remake, it was already great to begin with."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-21,"One thing about James, he&#39;s always going to deliver!"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I watched the original and I feel like this trailer gives away soo much.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Thanks for showing the whole movie
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,This exact movie with the exact title came out in 2022. Why did they remake this ALREADY?!?!?!!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I&#39;m still undecided if I should be happy that such a brilliant movie will reach a larger audience or sad that a brilliant movie that was already acted in English is being remade only two years after its release for no good reason at all.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"Ever since Split, James McAvoy has been one of my favorite actors"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"I was going to hold my tongue about this remake, but with a September release date, this is just a stone&#39;s throw away."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"Yeah, it doesn&#39;t take a behavioral therapist to know that kid&#39;s tongue got chopped off üòÇ"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,"Bust out laughing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjzxI6uf8H8&amp;t=89"">1:29</a>. James McAvoy&#39;s laugh and expressions are comical. He&#39;s like a little kid that just got away with something and the parents haven&#39;t realized yet X&#39;D"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,PLEASE watch the ORIGINAL!<br>A MASTERPIECE
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I will root for any character James McAvoy plays simply because James McAvoy is playing him üò§üò§üò§. They can NEVER make me hate you James!!! NEVER!!!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy&#39;s willingness to be in schlock horrors is super admirable.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,You know it&#39;s gonna be a great movie when James McAvoy is in it.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I love the original one. But I don&#39;t know why they would show that the kid has no tongue in this trailer. That was supposed to be a shocker.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Halt and Catch Fire reunion I did not see coming üòÖ couldn&#39;t think of anything elese because I&#39;ve just finished rewatch ‚ù§
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjzxI6uf8H8&amp;t=91"">1:31</a> james mcavoy transforms into gerard butler üòÇ"
Speak No Evil,2024-04-13,"I literally just saw the original and Blumhouse has already snatched it up. The casting is great though, I am looking forward to it."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy looking more and more like gerard butler lol
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,James McAvoy will be so psychotic in Speak No Evil!
Speak No Evil,2024-04-21,James McAvoy. one of the best actors ever üò≠‚ú®
Speak No Evil,2024-04-20,Anything James McAvoy acting in I watching fuss I love to see him act. Will definitely be watching this ‚ù§
Speak No Evil,2024-07-13,"Well, don&#39;t need to watch the film now, that&#39;s pretty much covered it! Very efficient, cheers."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"This looks promising. I hope it‚Äôs an improvement of the original Danish film of the same name. That film was outstanding but very frustrating at times, especially the ending. The Danish couple was way too polite &amp; compliant &amp; didn‚Äôt fight for their daughter. Plus, I found it hard to believe they‚Äôd go back for a stuffed animal if they were that scared. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, I highly recommend it."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,That I&#39;m not a Doctor scene! Was just pure evil haha
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"&quot;Written for the screen and directed by James Watkins, the writer-director of Eden Lake&quot; Okayyyyyyy okayyyy I will be seated"
Speak No Evil,2024-05-04,Looking forward to this one. James McAvoy is so talented! I JUST saw split and was absolutely shook at his performance! Not only is he able to mask his strong Scottish accent perfectly. he is also able to evoke terror just with facial expressions. He goes from friendly to absolutely frightening! Great actor!
Speak No Evil,2024-06-05,Wow they remade it? The way this trailer tells you everything is wild. James McAvoy is a stellar actor though
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Omg I love the original movie. Definitely gonna watch this. Especially it&#39;s James Mcavoy
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,WHY ‚Ä¶. Make a remake? WATCH‚Ä¶ the original- a gem.
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Haven&#39;t we seen this already? Also spoiling everything in the trailer is a smart move. Congrats!
Speak No Evil,2024-06-27,"James McAvoy scares me, his acting is phenomenal!"
Speak No Evil,2024-06-15,"I‚Äôm here for this, I don‚Äôt always like remakes, but McAvoy never disappoints."
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,Why are we remaking a movie that came out 2 years ago?
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,I am cautiously optimistic for this. The original was an unhinged masterpiece of terror and despair and I actually think based on this trailer that it has the possibility to surpass the original IF. DONE. CORRECTLY.
Speak No Evil,2024-09-10,god James always kills it in every role! him in this role is so eerie woah
Speak No Evil,2024-04-11,"So let me get this straight, Kevin with 23 personalities from Split became a doctor, got married, started a family and became friends with another family. Cool."
Speak No Evil,2024-08-07,YESS JAMES MCAVOY is going to be great in this üôåüèª
Speak No Evil,2024-04-15,yeah thanks for showing the whole movie in the trailer again
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,The couple: why are you doing this?<br>The strangers: Because we‚Äôve have been contracted for seven more sequels
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,‚ÄúBecause you were home‚Äù is such a better line
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-04,&quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;So the studio&#39;s rights to this intellectual property don&#39;t expire.&quot;
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,The fact that they‚Äôre making ‚Äúorigin‚Äù movies to The Strangers proves they don‚Äôt understand what made the first one so scary.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,The fact ALL three parts were filmed back to back has me so curious how this will go. And Mads is so good at acting scared....fingers crossed
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,those 2 kids on bikes will grow to become the dudes from Funny Games
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Feels like I&#39;ve seen this movie 1000 times and it&#39;s not even out yet.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-04,Whole movie in 2 minutes. Thanks for saving my time
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-09,&quot;Because you were home&quot; is still one of the most spine-tingling lines in horror.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,&quot;Witness how the strangers became the strangers&quot;... Why did I laugh so hard at this üíÄ
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,&quot;never fuck with the original&quot; - Sidney Prescott
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to us?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBecause you were home.‚Äù
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,&quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot; <br>&quot;Because we&#39;ve been trying to reach you about your car&#39;s extended warranty.&quot;
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,This is literally just the first movie filmed a second time
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to us?‚Äù<br>&quot;I guess it&#39;s the weather.&quot;
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,Strangers: &quot;Because you were home&#39;&#39;<br>Strangers Prey Of The Night: &quot;Why not?&#39;&#39;<br>Strangers Chapter 1: &quot;Because you&#39;re here&#39;&#39;
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-13,"The 2008 was so scary because most of the time didn&#39;t had background music, villains were always silent, and no jumpscares, it was more realistic."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-04-26,The first one was the most scariest movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Scary because this can actually happen in real life.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-07,‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to us‚Äù?<br>‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre bored honestly‚Äù
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,They literally showed the entire first movie. From start to end.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-03,"2008 film still lives rent free in my head to this day. Not sure it really needed a remake, but I&#39;m hyped"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"When I saw those Mormon boys I was like pure nostalgia, the only beef I have with the trailer is that the music doesn&#39;t match up with the theme of the movie"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Haven‚Äôt we leaned by now not to go to cabins in the middle of nowhere
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-04-02,"Couldn‚Äôt leave well enough alone. The Strangers stands in my top 5 movies of all time. It‚Äôs spine-tingling nihilism. No reason, no justification. No backstory. No identities. ‚ÄúBecause you were home.‚Äù I mean it‚Äôll be entertaining but does anyone else feel that some things just don‚Äôt need sequels, prequels, etc. and that something can just stand on its own?"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,If anyone is after the trailer song it&#39;s &quot;Trouble&quot; by Cage The Elephant
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,Idgaf what makes these movies so unique imo it‚Äôs not over the top. It‚Äôs so realistic you feel like it‚Äôs you in the situation. That‚Äôs what made the first one so good. I feel like if the acting is top tier this could go really well.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-04,The fact that they filmed all 3 already shows me they have full confidence in this and I loved the original so I‚Äôm here for it .
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-04,Wow I can‚Äôt believe they uploaded the entire movie to YouTube. Usually it‚Äôs just the trailer
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"Most intriguing part is Sackhead and Pin-Up Girl, cuddling at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=103"">1:43</a>. Really interesting potential dynamic for killers"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-10,this song usage is perfect fr
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,I loved the subtle references to the original 2 films like the vinyl records being here and the Ford pick up headlights like in prey at night
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-07,It&#39;s literally impossible for someone to be shrouded in that much darkness when they&#39;re literally standing at your front door.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-12,"I&#39;m a Canadian, and I live in a remote city of British Columbia (border to idaho).Thats why I love these kind of movies which are set in a cabin, shotguns, motorbikes etc."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"The original is one of the all time favorites, scarred me. Would love to find out that these movies are in the same universe! Let‚Äôs gooooo"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Marketing it as a Prequel when it&#39;s actually just a modern remake... It looks almost identical to the original film. IT LOOKS AWESOME!
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,The first movie messed with everyone and still fucks with me. The strangers is legit scary because this actually happens to people every day. It‚Äôs not like ghost face or Michael Myers. I‚Äôm so excited for thisü§ò
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-07,"Ah, this brings back memories of being young and seeing this in theaters and then wanting to rent it to show it to everyone i know. The original strangers movie has always been my favorite. Its such an underrated gem. Yes, the original will never be touched and i agree with some saying that it was scarier when there was no origin story but i will still see this. I want to see a whole new generation fall in love with the strangers franchise. Its okay to let things change. I have high hopes I&#39;ll be good either way"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> Her chin is doing most of the acting :))"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,"Finally, they started adding good songs in the trailers!"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Love Madeleine ! She‚Äôs such a good actress can‚Äôt wait to watch this and how the other ones will turn out!!!
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"Origin story? So I&#39;m calling it that the main couple, or at least the redhead will become one of the actual Strangers in the other 2 sequels, since they filmed all 3 at the same time"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"The trailer went over the beginning, middle, and end...good God."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-06,The &quot;Why not.&quot; line from the sequel was chilling.<br>If they used it again most people&#39;s hearts would drop.<br>Such a cold line for two words.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-22,"Ima need ‚ÄúThe Total Eclipse Of The Heart‚Äù to be in chapter 1, 2, &amp; 3."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-04-01,Thank you so much for not giving away the movie&#39;s entire plot. I really appreciate it.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-07,This makes me never wanna go to a cabin in the middle of the woods
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-04-22,"He‚Äôs most likely not going to see this, but Froy was a good elementary-school friend of mine. In middle school we naturally drifted apart as he went on to attend a special performing-arts school (I actually found this out years later on Wikipedia lol, before that I just knew he no longer went to the same middle school as I did, was kinda worried about where he went üòÇ). He was a massively creative and imaginative kid and I remember a hell of a singer even back then. Through the years I read he got into some Disney shows and then today, here I am, scrolling through YouTube and finding out that he will be starring as a lead in a major studio film. Kudos, Froy, you deserve it!"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"i love first chapter.. also strangers 2 is really good.. trailer showed too much,hope there is some good gory kills"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=70"">1:10</a> there‚Äôs no damn way she didn‚Äôt see him bro üò≠"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Was this reboot necessary? Absolutely not. Will I be watching this in theaters? Absolutely.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-14,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=102"">1:42</a> I love this shot so much"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,"I don&#39;t know how long the movie is going to be, but I feel I&#39;ve seen it all in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=144"">2:24</a>."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,"Any one notice the chin throwing up gang signs lmaoo @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> ü§£üíÄ"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-09,The orignal still fkn chills me to the bone - this does not give off the same vibe at all.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-09,The fact it was based on a true story made the original scary af can‚Äôt see a remake being anywhere near as scary
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-05-02,The original is legit still one of the scariest and best horror movies ever. This looks like a modern day repeat of the same movie‚Ä¶
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,"Is it just me, or has anyone else become really confused? In previous movies, the line was &quot;Is Tamara home?&quot; and &quot;Because you&#39;re home.&quot; Now, they&#39;ve been changed to &quot;Is Tamara here?&quot; and &quot;Because you&#39;re here.&quot;<br><br>Like, there might be an explanation for that!"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,The way the strangers prey at night ended I always had a feeling  there would be a prequel or prequels I knew this trailer would say witness how the strangers.... Became the strangers. I&#39;m old enough to remember seeing the first movie in theaters in 2008
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,"The people playing the strangers are throwing me off, like they way they move and talk they don&#39;t sounds right. The original will always have my heart."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-14,Couple: &quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot;<br>The Strangers: &quot;bc we were in a silly goofy mood.&quot;
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-02,Madeline&#39;s acting looks great in this. Excited!!
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Song: Trouble - Cage The Elephant
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Madelaine Petsch never disappoints. We all know for a fact she&#39;s keen on portraying challenging characters.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,Thanks for showing the whole movie üòÖ
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,This is one of my most anticipated films of the year.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Wow...they took out every bit of subtlety out of the original.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,"Ok this is wild, its the first time i‚Äôve seen a movie that existed in my life time get a remake. Now i get it when old folks say ‚Äúthe original was just fine leave it alone!‚Äù"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Going to watch it because Madelaine Petsch is in it.
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"I honestly can&#39;t wait for this!! I fell in love with the Strangers since the first installment!!! For me, it&#39;s like seeing old friends again!!!!  Hahahaha!!!"
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-01,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZUQmZdOi4&amp;t=137"">2:17</a> how much you wanna bet they dressed his girlfriend up as one of the killers.."
The Strangers: Chapter 1,2024-03-03,Rinse and repeat üîÅ
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Finally, a movie about the horrors of owning and maintaining your own pool!"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"There is something inherently terrifying about swimming by yourself at night, glad to see a movie taking full advantage of that"
Night Swim,2023-10-06,I love how all horror movies starts with a family and two kids driving
Night Swim,2023-10-29,"Who keeps their eyes closed for that long in a game of Marco Polo lmaooooooooo she‚Äôs so dam dedicated, that monster had time to switch the lights on and off, kill the other dude, change the water temperature, make a sandwich, pay property taxes‚Ä¶."
Night Swim,2023-10-06,The happy family - jumping all smiles - and the word Blumhouse appears. And you realize this is about to go bad for them. LOL I love it.
Night Swim,2023-10-10,"This is like the one scene in any horror movie involving a pool, except it&#39;s being expanded into an entire film. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how it turns into a 90+ min movie"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Remember if you notice something weird or disturbing going on in a pool, get out of there immediately"
Night Swim,2023-12-08,I laughed when the monster actually replied ‚ÄúPOLO!‚Äù üòÇ
Night Swim,2023-12-23,This movie is giving me all the nostalgia vibes. I was a 90s kid and grew up watching Are You Afraid of the Dark. There‚Äôs an episode  called Dead Man‚Äôs Float and it scared the hell out of me. It was about a monster living inside of a pool. I was terrified to swim at night in our pool after watching that episode. I‚Äôm really excited to watch this!
Night Swim,2023-10-09,"I love the shot at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> of the light coming from the pool‚Äôs surface. It‚Äôs terrifying how far away it is. It reminds me of Get Out when he‚Äôs in the Sunken Place looking up at his body."
Night Swim,2023-10-06,Cannot wait to see this!
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I like that the trailer didn&#39;t give too much away.  I hope Wyatt Russell plays a prominent role.  He&#39;s great.
Night Swim,2023-11-07,Finally a movie based off of my favorite are you afraid of the Dark segment &quot;Tale of the Dead Mans Float&quot;
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I actually like the idea of a swimming pool horror movie.<br><br>Update: it‚Äôs bad. :(
Night Swim,2023-10-06,The trailer ends in a way that makes me want to have more context and I love that. Because I can‚Äôt even imagine how they made a movie about a haunted swimming pool. The concept is kinda odd and confusing but that confusion has me extremely invested.
Night Swim,2023-10-08,The scary part here is how long it took her to realise that her boyfriend ditched her in the pool and then immediately dives into the water after realising that she was left alone. I know people in horror movies are supposed to be dumber than actual people (to create situations of tension and whatnot) but this one takes the cake in recent years üòÇ
Night Swim,2023-11-29,"Now, a haunted swimming pool. Next, a toilet with a poltergeist. NIGHT DUMP."
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Oh my God Why did Ronan just leave? After the second Marco with no response just open your eyes girl! Anyway looks fun, I&#39;ll look for it when it comes out."
Night Swim,2023-10-13,I feel like we&#39;ve always played around with the idea of scaring each other (or quietly sneaking out of the pool üòÇ) whilst playing Marco Polo and I&#39;m so excited to see a movie carry that further
Night Swim,2023-10-06,"The way the monster is looking up at the pool from the abyss @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=107"">1:47</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> is creepy. There&#39;s so much they could do with this concept. Can&#39;t wait to see this."
Night Swim,2023-11-24,"I just wanna say I&#39;m hyped for Wyatt Russell! I&#39;m gonna see the movie, just to see him."
Night Swim,2023-10-06,Its gonna be interesting to see how you could make a whole movie with this concept but im so excited and will definitely be watching.
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=104"">1:44</a> The end had me laughing! ü§£"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,Oh my gosh... never swimming at night again and i haven&#39;t even seen the movie yet!! üòÇ Cannot wait to see this! Love the creative suspense and SO glad they didnt give too much away.
Night Swim,2023-10-23,i saw a short movie like this and now there will be a MOVIE
Night Swim,2023-12-15,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=103"">1:43</a> When you go night swimming in Gotham city"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Wow, she is really dedicated to playing a game for elementary school kids and keeping her eyes closed no matter what... Next, a scary movie about a deadly game of &quot;I Spy.&quot;"
Night Swim,2023-10-08,"I like horror movies that take ordinary things and turn them into something scary.<br>Like dolls, hotel rooms or in this case swimming pools."
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I knew this was coming soon. Love Blumhouse.
Night Swim,2023-11-26,I&#39;d be out after the 2nd Marco. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that ü§®
Night Swim,2023-11-01,"When I was a kid, I had a serious fear from pools, especially from that little black holes for water filtering on the bottom of the pools. Now, as an adult, I could relive my childhood trauma, lol XD"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,If it‚Äôs even half as well done as the short film I‚Äôll be happy.
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I use to night swim at my grandmothers house and I was always worried about a shark coming to get us.. I was really little when all the jaws movies came out in the movie theater so I watch one after the other then went swimming at my grandmothers house so my older sister and cousins would tease me relentlessly! ü¶à
Night Swim,2023-10-05,Is it the nun swimming down there lol
Night Swim,2023-10-28,James Wan never disappoints.
Night Swim,2023-11-29,"I mean lets be real, who isn‚Äôt terrified of swimming in the pool at night"
Night Swim,2023-10-06,More than 1 minute movie scene included in trailer to raise the bar !!!üëèüëèüëè
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"This is just terrifying when you swim by yourself at night which I refuse to do, I like how the movie is <b>taking a lesson from that as a advantage</b> for that in my opinion. The concept of a horror movie on a Swimming pool I think it&#39;s nice."
Night Swim,2023-10-06,"That foot grab is wonderful, hope we see more! This will be a good movie"
Night Swim,2023-11-29,I think there&#39;s a monster in the pool üëπüíÄüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåä
Night Swim,2023-12-21,This reminds me of that one episode of ‚Äúare you afraid of the dark‚Äù. So glad to see my childhood nightmares being reimagined
Night Swim,2023-10-10,I thought I was the only person that was hella paranoid in the swimming pool at night üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I have so many questions: where did the guy go when he got out of the pool? Wouldn&#39;t he have seen the flickering?
Night Swim,2023-10-08,I laughed so hard seeing this. I can already see the movie playing out in my headüòÇ
Night Swim,2023-10-31,"When me and a friend saw this trailer in a theater, the moment the girl gets dragged, she turns to me and goes ‚ÄúThe Gongoozler‚Äù. I have never stifled a laughing fit quicker in my life."
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I&#39;m so happy the Gon Goozler is finally going to be on the big screen. Definitely one of the moments of movie history!
Night Swim,2023-10-05,This trailer was effective af! Just enough content to make me wanna buy a ticket.
Night Swim,2023-10-06,A 15-20 minute story stretched into a 90-100 minute movie lol üòÇ
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"This is actually such a terrifying concept, can‚Äôt wait to see it."
Night Swim,2023-10-09,"My thalassophobia just kicked in, even tho the anxiety I got from watching this clip I&#39;m still going to watch lol"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,I love this trailer‚ù§
Night Swim,2023-10-25,For WHEN in theaters?
Night Swim,2023-11-15,I feel like all these movies start off with unsuspecting suburban family moving into murder home! ü§£ü§£
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Now if only someone would make a haunted toaster film, my life would be complete!"
Night Swim,2023-10-06,Really tapping into my childhood fear that somehow there was something that was gonna kill me in the deep end of the public pool.
Night Swim,2023-10-05,This gave me It Follows vibes ‚Ä¶ <br>Hyped for this one :)
Night Swim,2023-10-27,This is the movie of all time.
Night Swim,2023-10-08,James Wan rarely does a bad movie - looking forward to this one !!
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"This reminds me of that old episode on are you afraid of the dark, the tale of the dead man‚Äôs float."
Night Swim,2023-10-15,"For once, I want to see a horror movie where the character didn&#39;t make one dumb decisions after another and still got trapped, because there was nothing they could do to escape from the supernatural. Why is it so difficult to come up with that kind of story?"
Night Swim,2023-10-25,"The absolute scariest part of this film, will be the pool cleaner presenting his service charge to the parents..."
Night Swim,2023-10-09,Ab koi raat ko swim nahi karega üòÇüòÇ ek bar to yad ayegi hi ye movie<br> Very happy to see James Wan back in horror genre ‚ù§ missed him after seeing nun 2 and conjuring 3üòÖ
Night Swim,2023-10-14,I‚Äôve always feared swimming at night in my swimming pool. I also remember playing Marco Polo with my brothers at night too ; terrified if they don‚Äôt answer back as a joke. I always thought some shark would eat me alive. I am so glad someone had this idea!
Night Swim,2023-10-05,"Needless to say, I LOVE it!"
Night Swim,2023-12-01,So &quot;it&quot; shows up 10 seconds after the guy leaves? wtf?
Night Swim,2023-12-17,"This looks like it could be very good, but the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> moment where they say Marco Polo is one of the most unintentionally funny moments I&#39;ve seen in a trailer. Otherwise, looks great."
Night Swim,2023-11-03,"You can feel Wan‚Äôs touch here with the choice in shots and built of anticipation in what terrifying thing will happen, he‚Äôs truly a master at horrorüôåüèª"
Night Swim,2023-11-14,Girl just open ur eyes...its not that serious...
Night Swim,2023-11-03,How could anybody think that this looks scary??
Night Swim,2023-10-24,"Nice film, a bit short though"
Night Swim,2023-10-07,Cool idea - but I feel like most people would‚Äôve BEEN opened their eyes and swam away
Night Swim,2023-10-29,The part where the ??? says &quot;POLO&quot; made me laugh. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s as scary as the filmmakers hoped it would be.
Night Swim,2023-10-09,This movie looks fun to watch! I thought i was the only one who thinks something is in the pool when Iam swimming! As a kid Are you afraid of the dark on Nickelodeon had an episode similar to this movie and that was a rap for me! üòÇ
Night Swim,2023-11-30,This trailer was def better than Trailer 2. They should&#39;ve just stuck with this one until the movie dropped.
Night Swim,2023-10-05,Did they finally turn that horrifying ‚ÄúAre You Afraid The Dark‚Äù episode about the pool demon into a movie?
Night Swim,2023-10-05,Oh this is gonna be dope
Night Swim,2023-11-05,I love the fact that they made a horror movie based on a swimming pool. I would definitely watch this
Night Swim,2023-10-06,The trailer alone gave me chills so can‚Äôt wait for this to come out! Could it be a house at HHN next year like a few of the other Blumhouse movies were?! Maybe? It‚Äôs a Universal film so you never know!
Night Swim,2023-11-03,"What was that thing on her neck at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE&amp;t=43"">0:43</a>?"
Night Swim,2023-10-05,The ‚Äúpolo‚Äù scare was perfectly campy.
Night Swim,2023-11-08,This looks like the type of movie a character in a cartoon would watch
Night Swim,2023-11-02,Was that supposed to be scaryüòÇ really Marco Polo? üòÇ
Night Swim,2023-12-15,The most unrealistic part of this movie so far is that she kept her eyes closed after not getting a response after 2 marcos
Night Swim,2023-11-20,One the few trailers that doesn&#39;t give the entire movie away. üëç
Conclave,2024-07-18,"They couldn&#39;t have chosen a better Actor, Ralph is supremely talented"
Conclave,2024-07-18,I say Ralph Fiennes is due for an Oscar
Conclave,2024-07-18,"&quot;There is one sin which I have come to fear above all others: certainty. If there was only certainty, and no doubt, there would be no mystery. And therefore, no need for faith.&quot;"
Conclave,2024-07-19,Catholicism has fantastic aesthetics
Conclave,2024-08-15,Hope Ralph gets his oscar. So many times he played villians  perfectly but he also played romantic roles like in the english Patient. He deserves it!
Conclave,2024-07-18,I was waiting for Jude Law to come out with his Cherry Coke Zero
Conclave,2024-07-18,I hope Ralph Fiennes wins an oscar it&#39;s time
Conclave,2024-07-18,"Just like all the other comments, let&#39;s get Ralph his Oscar."
Conclave,2024-07-18,Really hoping Isabella Rossellini can score her first Oscar nomination for this.
Conclave,2024-07-20,That shot of the ash falling from the top feels like a medieval painting üòÆ glorious!
Conclave,2024-07-18,Ralph Fiennes is the greatest actor without an Oscar. Hope he actually wins this time.
Conclave,2024-07-18,Y&#39;all let&#39;s root for Ralph Fiennes for that Oscar!!

Conclave,2024-07-18,"Direction,Acting,lavish production design and costumes Oscars nominations is confirm"
Conclave,2024-07-22,"What a cast. Ralph is one of the finest actors of a generation. Who else could be so powerful and diverse as Voldemort and &quot;M&quot;. Add a pinch of Tucci and John Lithgow, wow. Importantly Isabella Rossellini is just brilliance personified! Looks like a must see and I agree Jude Law as &quot;Lenny the Pope&quot;  (sounds like a goodfellas character) would round this out nicely."
Conclave,2024-07-18,Ralph gunning for that Oscar.
Conclave,2024-07-20,"Everybody talking about Ralph Fienbes, but can we acknowledge Isabella Rossellini. That woman is an Italian godsend. Really glad she&#39;s gaining recognition again."
Conclave,2024-07-18,What a superb casting!
Conclave,2024-07-18,Now we need Tom Hanks and Anthony Hopkins to make cameos lol
Conclave,2024-07-26,"they surely couldn&#39;t find a better actors, the actors are CHEF KISS!!"

Conclave,2024-07-19,"Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow - 3 great actors."
Conclave,2024-07-23,"this is a trailer. So many trailers recently for movies and shows just give it all away, this one truly does not, it makes us interested while giving us just enough to have an idea of what it is and how good it might be"
Conclave,2024-07-18,Cardinal Voldemort and the Chamber of Secrets
Conclave,2024-07-20,Ralph Fiennes AND Isabella Rossellini in this?  I‚Äôm so there.

Conclave,2024-07-18,"Great cast, intriguing plot, trailer doesn‚Äôt show much, not a sequel‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-20,I rowed for the University of Washington for one year (1986-1987).  It was the most physically demanding thing I ever experienced.  I still have my race jersey;  it symbolizes a &quot;never quit&quot; approach to life for me.  I cannot wait to see this movie!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-26,"As one of Bob Moch&#39;s grandson&#39;s i am incredibly proud to see this incredible, seemingly impossible story come to life on the screen...  My grandfather told me this story many times when I was still a child and the full impact of it never really hit me until I saw this film for the first time.  Again i want to thank Jenn Gibbons of the George Pocock Foundation for finding an advance ticket for me on December 12th.   This story doesnt just tug at the heartstrings... It instills pride in an amazing group of men that beat all of the odds.  I was able to take my adult children to see the film last night and all three of us where moved to tears at almost every moment in the film...   In closing I genuinely hope that everyone is moved as much as I have been..."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-05,"As someone who rows, this trailer gave me chills. I‚Äôve been rowing since the summer before seventh grade and plan on doing it in college. I love rowing with every fiber of my being and love that rowing is getting the recognition it deserves through this movie! The book was incredible and I can‚Äôt wait to see this film!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-18,"My Grandfather rowed for UW in the late 20s. The 1929  photo in the front of the book of the team members sawing a large log has my grandfather, Gail W Burleigh, in it.  At Grandpa Burleigh‚Äôs funeral, his 3rd son, said he was most proud of his rowing for UW.  He was a a dry land boy, very poor, but played defensive end for football in high school and a short time for UW.  <br><br>However, he couldn‚Äôt stay in college and had to return to Great Falls to help his single mother pay bills.  He was a husband, father to 4 sons, and a cattle rancher in MT the rest of his life.  He also helped fight the MannGulch fire of 1949 since he owned the Beartooth ranch close to where to smoke jumpers died.   <br>Looking forward to this movie, Susan"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,"I was a singles&#39; sculler in one of the very few university programs that offered sculling in the US. While the training is brutal (esp in early spring, we&#39;re talking 5:30 am wake up calls in the freezing cold, followed by the dreaded erg machine), there is something hauntingly beautiful about rowing on the water when all that hard work just comes together. I do miss it."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-27,"My daughter rowed on the coed club team at Clemson University. I read the book soon after she joined the team. What these athletes go through during training and racing is incredible. My daughter&#39;s crews were successful, medaling in 17 races over 8 semesters."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-23,My Father was on the rowing team of the University of Washington during  1940‚Äôs.  I heard how hard they worked and have pictures which showed him with a body builder physique. This movie is a must for me and my family!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,"Based on a true story. I watched a special done by PBS about these young men and their coach. Remarkable story. They were incredible. All the obstacles that were put in their way yet they still managed to overcome each one. That documentary was fantastic and I still think about it. I had no idea they&#39;d made a movie out of it. The trailer looks good. I hope George Clooney does this story and those who lived it along with their families, justice. I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed when I go see it."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-09,Easily one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read in my life. I can‚Äôt wait for the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-24,"I grew up in Seattle and went to the University of Washington, and I loved the book in part for what it told about both during the 1930s.  The book in its organization and presentation almost felt like a screenplay so I‚Äôve been envisioning a movie for nearly a decade.  I‚Äôm disappointed that they didn‚Äôt shoot in Seattle but I‚Äôm hopeful that I‚Äôll like the film."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-24,"As a former high school rower, I&#39;m excited to see the sport highlighted on the global stage.  It was the hardest and most fulfilling thing I ever did, and taught me work ethic and passion for everything I do, even 35 years later."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-25,"Finally, a studio that knows how to make a trailer, with inspiring music and an uplifting story. Who knew?"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-28,"Cannot wait to see this - the book was amazing... always destined for the big screen, and a group of heroes that are long overdue for their recognition..."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-16,"Currently reading the book. As a foreigner and resident near UW, it is amazing to see the background of that era and spirit of crew. Cannot wait to see the movie! Go dawgs!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-26,"It was a great movie!   Loved the entire storyline.  Life has enough real drama without Hollywood having to pump out garbage.  When America was humble, men were resilient, and courage and sacrifice were thought worthy efforts."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-19,"I rowed for the University of San Diego and still row with friends 40 years later.  I still am friends with the guys I rowed with, it changed my life.  This was an awesome book.  This is a great sport for kids to get into."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,My mom went to Roosevelt in the 40s and one of these young men was her teacher. Looking forward to seeing this- Go Dawgs!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,As a crew rower this is just amazing. There‚Äôs hardly any movies about crew rowing and this looks like it will be the best one.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-17,I rowed for nearly 30 years competitively and recreationally.  I&#39;m currently on haitus from rowing but it has a deep place in my heart.  I hope to get back in the boat soon.  Loved this book and can&#39;t wait to see the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-09,"As a rower myself who has read the book many times, I can barely explain how excited I am for this movie"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,"I rowed for UW in 86-87, and 87-88.  After college I worked at Foster Pepper &amp; Shefelman for Cam Hall.  One of the firm&#39;s partners was coxswain Bob Moch!  I wish he could have seen this...!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-15,This was one of my favorite movies this year. Just a good-old-fashioned inspirational flick. They are very hard to beat!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-25,I worked at the Conibear Shellhouse and saw the boat these guys rowed in everyday. Didn‚Äôt understand until I read the book what it meant to see that boat. Stoked to watch this movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,One of the greatest U.S. Olympic stories ever!!!  Go Huskies!!!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,"I have a connection to this story in that the central character is from Sequim Washington as was some of my family, and my Dad was a student at the University of Washington during the time of this story. My Dad was always a fan of rowing, too."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-25,One of the best books I‚Äôve ever read! I hope the movie can do it justice!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-15,Its great to see more stuff from the 1936 olympics because so many great stories happened during these olympics and is one of the most important historic event that isnt talked about much.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-12,"I rowed on my college team.  Played every other sport almost and felt I was in pretty good shape.  Then I tried out for crew.  I was so wrong.  Most physically challenging sport I have ever done and I loved it!! What a great sport to showcase in a movie and an opportunity to tell the story of such an amazing team, their challenges and victory.  ‚ù§‚ù§"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,The book was a masterpiece! I can‚Äôt wait for the movie
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-22,As the mother of a son who rowed his heart out and coached his way into dental school and the Air Force i will be first in line for this movie! GO AMERICA!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,PBS put out a terrific documentary about these young men.  It is so good and inspiring I bought a streaming version rewatching it at least once a year!  This looks good too!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-20,&quot;FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER BELIEVED IN YOU.......AS ONE!.........AS ONE!!!&#39;<br><br>made me get up and run through bedroom wall.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,"Read the book 3 times. The great George Yeoman Pocock said, It&#39;s a great art, is rowing. It&#39;s the finest art their is. It&#39;s a symphony of motion. And when you&#39;re rowing well, why it&#39;s nearing perfection. And when you near perfection, you&#39;re touching the Divine. It touches the you of yous. Which is your soul! Do the book proud George Clooney."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-13,"I‚Äôm older, and just row on my erg. But I loved the feeling of rowing ever since I sat on an old Concept 2 Model C 30 years ago. Rowing was once followed just as much as baseball or football. I hope this reignites that fervor! The book is fantastic!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-17,"One of the best books I ever read, with an intimate look at how difficult times could be, and how the brave and fearless people of our country rose to meet it.  That it is true makes it all the more special."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-25,This is one of my all time favorite books. I‚Äôm so stoked that they‚Äôre making a movie! I just hope they do it justice.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-14,I&#39;m SO excited to see these amazing people portrayed on the big screen.  The trailer gave me chills.  I can&#39;t wait to see the scenes from history that I&#39;ve only imagined come to life on the big screen!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-21,I have read and re-read that book at least a half-dozen times. Each time I just can‚Äôt put it down. I can‚Äôt wait to see the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-20,Since I read the book many years ago I always wondered why isn‚Äôt there a movie on this fabulous piece of history - it‚Äôs about time..
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-13,"I‚Äôm a rower and I can‚Äôt wait for this movie! My entire crew and I are gonna go see it when it comes out! The book nailed the intensity of love and commitment needed in rowing, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how the movie captures it!"
The Boys in the Boat,2024-07-10,This is the best movie I have seen in years. I am so cynical concerning the ideological fanaticism that is prevalent in modern media. To have had the privilege to enjoy a modern movie free of that toxic addition was simply delightful. Well done to the film makers and thank you.
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-02,"Just watched this movie today, it was fantastic. Highly recommend. Left with a big smile on my face. Such a good way to start the year."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-05,I&#39;ve watched this over 50 times on loop mode. Love it. Can&#39;t wait!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,"As a former rower, this does put a smile on my face."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-22,As a Gonzaga high school rower I went to the west coast to row. I held an American record as well as was in the midst of Trail Blazers in rowing. Best years of my life and the thrill of winning stotesbury along with many other memories. I was given four copies of the book. The sheer ability to never give up is in everyone
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-08,"This looks amazing. I read the book, and I really look forward to this! <br>P.S. If anyone seeing this hasn&#39;t read the book, but like reading at least a little, you should definitely read it eventually!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,Love love love Callum Turner! So excited for this movie. Love the book &amp; the story and I used to live near the UW crew house. Can‚Äôt wait!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-12,Read the book a couple of years ago. Knew zero about rowing and never cared about it. Now I believe it&#39;s one of the greatest sports out there and I can&#39;t wait to see the movie!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-24,these are the kinds of movies we need nowadays
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,"Dubs and I approve.  Doesn&#39;t hurt that we tailgate with Rantz&#39;s grandson.  :) UW Crew is still dominating today!  Dad was a Husky, I&#39;m a Husky and my daughter is at the UW now. Go Dawgs!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-17,"I was recruited for and rowed on the udub crew team my freshman year back in 2008/2009. I lasted one year. Never thought I could push my body THAT hard, and I had already been doing crew four years prior to that. The thing that I remember standing out the most was the annual triathlon."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-12,We got to see this movie tonight as a &quot;Secret Cinema&quot; event and we absolutely LOVED it! I&#39;m going to see it again once it&#39;s released. ‚ù§‚ù§
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,Can&#39;t wait!  The book was outstanding.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-30,Most emotional and motivational movie I have seen since The King&#39;s Speech. I&#39;ll see it again. I&#39;ll take others.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-24,I‚Äôm so excited for Callum Turner to  be a lead in this (mainstream) movie! You may have seen him in Fantastic Beast as the brother but I quite like his other lesser known works. Very talented and so excited for his big break !
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-20,I&#39;ve been waiting for this book to be made into a movie. So happy it&#39;s finally being done!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-29,Great book!  Read it on the plane to London when I rowed in the Henley Masters.  Can‚Äôt wait to see it.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-11,"Robert Moch was coxswain for this team, and he graduated from our small town high school. Our community is very proud of his accomplishments."
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-01,"I love true, inspirational stories like this!  It&#39;s amazing what people can accomplish when they are hungry and fighting for their lives!<br>Like the story of the fox and the rabbit; The fox is running for his dinner.  The rabbit is running for his life!<br><br>&quot;A worker‚Äôs appetite works for him because his hunger drives him onward.&quot; -Proverbs 16:26"
The Boys in the Boat,2024-02-04,I will be watching this movie today. I was the Cockswain for St Joseph&#39;s crew team in 1979 - 1981. We then combined schools at the boat house to form the Oakland Strokes team. Alot of early morning practices before school with strength training as well. I am so glad I was a part of it all. Many of memories! ‚ù§
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-21,"Una delle storie pi√π autentiche del mondo del canottaggio e dello sport in generale, nel quale si esalta lo spirito e il sacrificio di ragazzi che lottano per un sogno!<br>Ho letto il libro tre anni fa e sto aspettando il film come quando si aspetta un eclissi!üòä"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-26,"I rowed while at Hertford College, U of Oxford (college second ‚Äúfun‚Äù crew). Got hooked instantly. Then, haven‚Äôt rowed for thirty years until finally picking up good old C2 (the legendary Model D) during pandemic. I was barely in shape, struggling to break 11 mins 2.5k. Now, after 3 years, almost 5 million meters later and losing 15 lb, I achieved lifetime best of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEA-udzjjQ&amp;t=439"">7:19</a> 2k and routinely go under 20 mins 5k (my UT1 routine) which I didn&#39;t actually manage to do in my twenties. This may not look that impressive for a varsity crew but I am 48, only 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 145lb. <br>Anyway, as a ‚Äúrower‚Äù, Boys in the boat is truly awe-inspiring in the ways that I think only rowers can fully appreciate.  The book is a masterpiece and can&#39;t wait to see this movie THIS afternoonü§©"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-31,I‚Äôm teary eyed. I already know I would be bawling when I‚Äôm finally watching.
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-20,"Excellent Movie!  Exceptional writing, directing, acting, cinematography...I was cheering from my seat!!  We need more movies produced like this one!! Loved every minute!!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-07,I dated a women‚Äôs crew member when she was on a university team. The training and dedication to the sport and her teammates was amazing. I will definitely watch this movie. The fact that I live in Washington state and have followed their rowing crews for decades has nothing to do with my interest. LOL
The Boys in the Boat,2024-02-22,"Such a great inspiration movie made me emotional, happy and encouraged me too.  Kudos for coach , players and every person who had contributed."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-14,As a UW Alum and walking the same docks these men did years ago while reading the novel...I am so excited for this one.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,The book absolutely changed my life I cannot wait
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-26,"When you give men responsibility, a passion, a  goal, hard work then you have people staying out of trouble, learning strength and control and teamwork üëç"
The Boys in the Boat,2024-05-14,The kind of feel good films I love and have been longing to watch for a while now. Strength of character persevering and overcoming obstacles. No whining. Simple and great human values. üôå
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-21,"A movie about strong, determined men, sacrificing themselves for the collective good, kissing girls, and eating red meat. I‚Äôm amazed this film was allowed to be made."
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-17,"This is an outstanding film that brilliantly captures the world of The Great Depression, rowing and commitment. Set against the 1936 Berlin Olympics, it has the potential to become a future classic akin to &quot;Miracle&quot;. As someone who knew nothing about rowing, I was hooked from start to finish. The storytelling and performances make it a riveting cinematic experience, appealing to both sports enthusiasts and those who love a compelling, emotionally resonant story. A must-watch that transcends the sport!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,Dubs Up!  Best crew program over the last century.
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-11,One of the best books I ever read! I hope this movie will be able to do justice to this incredible story!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,"I actually row for a top 10 club in the U.S for youth, and I‚Äôm stoked for this movie to come out. Hope they did their research!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-26,Saw it on Chrismas day 2023 !! Amazing &amp; inspiring movie. Welll done Director.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-18,"Christmas  - when the Boys In The Boat film officially opens - is in six days. I lucked into a pre-release screening last night and was knocked out, COMPLETELY knocked out. When a book is as good and deeply layered as BITB, the film that often follows doesn&#39;t usually hit those same high notes. This one definitely did and man, I was SO glad. <br>Spoiler alert: there are no space ships or comic book characters in this movie, just fast boats and genuine heroes."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-25,"Best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, brilliant work"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-13,I rowed 4 years for the Rutgers Men&#39;s Heavyweight Crew (RU RAH RAH). So exciting to see this book come to film. Truly a legendary story for a college crew to reach the absolute highest echelons of rowing so quickly.  Badass crew! Nice to see all the other rowers in the comments! Who is ready to hop on an erg??!
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-21,"My Father-in-Law rowed for the University of Washington Huskies in the early 1970s.<br>He was also in the Naval ROTC. After graduation his active-duty service was as an assistant crew coach at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. His girlfriend was a Washington cheerleader, who he later married. Now in their 70s, they are still rowing in senior competitive events."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-12,"Those complaining there&#39;s no diversity. This is based on a true story. We value diversity, but we also respect history and truth."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-07,Absolutely a heroic story which needs to be seen!  Read the book first before watching the movie!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-04,I read the book and it was so good. I can&#39;t wait to see how it is as a movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-23,Gosh I love rowing. I enjoy watching when I visit England.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-14,Thanks to George Clooney we have a wonderful movie: a true story about good human values and triumph over adversity. No woke nonsense.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-15,"Rowing in 8&#39;s is great because it is a sport that allows David vs. Goliath stories.    If a boat is firing on all cylinders, they can punch way above their weight, so to speak."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-12,I literally screamed with joy when I saw the trailer tonight!!!! I am so happy!
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-15,Going to see it tonight! Thank you for making an awesome movie! Make more movies just like this! God bless america!
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-16,Greatest book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs about time it got a movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-19,"As a penniless freshman at Rutgers in the early sixties, I washed dishes at the Commons (student cafeteria that was in a WWII &quot;temporary&quot; aircraft hanger) I had no money so I used to eat from the garbage pail - the leftovers from the student teams that were fed there. They fed the football a lot of meat and I got plenty of scraps. But they were chintzy with the rowing teams (varsity and JV). I always groaned when they came in. They ate every scrap. Another night I would go hungry! Guess they worked those guys, certainly more than the lazy football players whom the coaching staff seemed to want to fatten up!!"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-18,"im not crying, you&#39;re crying.  Go Dawgs."
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-01,"I‚Äôm shocked, haven‚Äôt seen a trailer like this in years! Perhaps the tide is turning"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-19,"In the chapter where the book talks about Washington&#39;s race against Princeton, it describes Carnegie Lake in detail. I kayak in that lake frequently and the description exactly fits what the lake is still like 100 years later. I think that was filmed on location, so I can&#39;t wait to see it. And as a very competitive dragon boat racer, I can identify with the team. I&#39;ll be one of the first people to see it."
The Boys in the Boat,2024-01-25,"OMG !! I just watched this Movie. It is so Powerful. The Actors all gave Powerful performances, our Australian Joel Edgerton gave the most Powerful Portrayal of Coach Ulbrickson. So proud of Joel. Happy Australia Day 26th January 2024."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-11-14,My absolute favorite book! Absolutely can&#39;t wait.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-05,"Me and George stinkin Clooney must have been on the same wavelength, because I&#39;ve been OBSESSED with Boys in the Boat for the last 3 years at least since I found it in a bookstore!!  Man he better have done it justice and not prettied it up too much <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEA-udzjjQ&amp;t=154"">2:34</a>"
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-26,As a hs and college coxswain love this book and story. I especially enjoy hearing the cox at the end.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-16,"I first saw this trailer yesterday in the gym while on the rowing machine, lol. Came here to see it with sound. It&#39;s terrific exercise."
The Boys in the Boat,2023-10-19,I hope the back story of joe rantz is adequately covered in the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,2023-12-28,"I have never been a rower but learned to really appreciate the teamwork that goes into that sport, all I can say is wow what a great movie, I  loved it!!!"
Reagan,2024-07-04,"Freedom is a fragile thing,  it&#39;s never more than 1 generation away from extinction"
Reagan,2024-06-07,So sick and tired of movie trailers opening up with a &quot;chill&quot; version of an 80&#39;s classic song sang by someone that has lost the will to leave.
Reagan,2024-08-16,&quot;If we lose freedom here there&#39;s nowhere else to escape to. This is the last stand on Earth.&quot; <br>-Ronald Reagan
Reagan,2024-06-06,‚ÄúWho‚Äôs vice president? Jerry Lewis?‚Äù
Reagan,2024-06-06,Quiad is acting like he&#39;s doing an impression of Jack Nicholson doing an impression of Ronald Reagan.
Reagan,2024-06-06,"They better have a scene where the balloon pops in the audience, and Reagan just says &quot;Missed me!&quot;"
Reagan,2024-08-17,"&quot;This idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man&#39;s relation to man. This is the issue of this election, whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant Capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.&quot; ~Ronald Reagan"
Reagan,2024-08-19,"If you call people who are critical of something you like &quot;communists,&quot; you just might not understand the America Ronald Reagan fought to protect from the USSR. Just sayin..."
Reagan,2024-08-19,I&#39;m 55 and Dennis has Regans&#39; voice down to a T.   I can&#39;t wait to see the movie.
Reagan,2024-06-27,This trailer doesn&#39;t capture why so many people liked Reagan and why Democrats loathed him so deeply.
Reagan,2024-08-14,These comments are crazy lol like don‚Äôt see it if it‚Äôs that deeply troubling. Dude was a famous president so of course they were gonna make a movie about him eventually
Reagan,2024-06-06,I&#39;m happy this movie exists just because it pisses off the people in this comment section
Reagan,2024-06-06,Did the trailer repeat it&#39;s self?
Reagan,2024-08-16,The comments shows what‚Äôs wrong with America and why this country is in decline. One simple word ‚ÄúHATE‚Äù
Reagan,2024-06-06,This legitimately looks like an SNL parody trailer.
Reagan,2024-06-06,A bunch of communists crying in the comments
Reagan,2024-06-06,Are they going to tell the truth about Reagan?
Reagan,2024-07-27,"For all you people commenting on Iran Contra, why would you assume it is not in the movie? It&#39;s in the trailer."
Reagan,2024-06-06,"Hey look, it&#39;s The Iron Lady: USA Edition!"
Reagan,2024-08-17,Back when we had a president worth respecting.
Reagan,2024-06-06,Bro is getting cooked in these comments üòÇüò≠üôè
Reagan,2024-06-06,Somehow palpatine returned
Reagan,2024-06-06,Are they gonna include the part where he sold weapons to Iran to fund right-wing death-squads in Nicaragua and then covered it all up? How about the cocaine trafficking? How about him taking policy advice from his wife&#39;s astrologer?
Reagan,2024-06-06,"&quot;On a budget of 150 million, the movie only made $10,000.&quot;"
Reagan,2024-06-06,Sooo...is it going to talk about Reagan-nomics? Trickle Down Economics? Watergate? War on Drugs? Iran-Contra? <br><br>If not then this shouldn&#39;t even exist.
Reagan,2024-08-01,"A movie is gonna be short, this deserves a series"
Reagan,2024-06-06,Man nowadays every character movie just has the persons freakin last name as the title. How original.
Reagan,2024-06-07,Wow this trailer about a historic figure Ronald Regan protrayed by Dennis quaid is remarkable <br>And the way he talks with the audience and California accent so well done üëç
Reagan,2024-08-03,Penelope Ann Miller is a wonderful Nancy Reagan.
Reagan,2024-06-06,What intern thought recycling another cover of this song made sense for this trailer
Reagan,2024-08-14,Quaid&#39;s acting like he&#39;s in an SNL skit
Reagan,2024-08-01,"Was not perfect, but he pulled america out of a hole and put us a path of  prosperity"
Reagan,2024-06-06,&quot;The actor&quot;?????
Reagan,2024-08-18,The biggest mistake reagan made was focusing on the communist overseas rather than the ones here at home.
Reagan,2024-06-06,"Nah, this is too sugar-coated"
Reagan,2024-08-18,"Pinkos in the comments still seem angry about Reagan winning the cold war.  Sorry, commies, not sorry! :D"
Reagan,2024-06-06,&quot;Im glad reagan dead&quot; - Killer Mike
Reagan,2024-08-19,Love this! Can&#39;t believe it doesn&#39;t have more views!
Reagan,2024-06-06,Are there going to include the scene where he briefed Russel Adler and the rest of the team to stop Perseus?
Reagan,2024-08-18,No offense but Dennis Quaid&#39;s Reagan looks rather like NixonüòÇ but the voice imitation is perfect
Reagan,2024-06-06,"Congrats to the lizard who wrote this movie, it <b>almost</b> sounds like actual dialogue"
Reagan,2024-06-06,Did they use repeated footage in this trailer?
Reagan,2024-06-06,Misunderstood the title. Thought it was an Exorcist movie.
Reagan,2024-07-18,Greatest President of All Time. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this üá∫üá∏
Reagan,2024-07-16,This looks tremendous.  Reagan was the 2nd best president in history behind Washington.  I‚Äôm hoping we make him proud in November!
Reagan,2024-06-06,This movie gonna ‚Äútrickle down‚Äùthe box office üòÇ ripbozo war criminal smoking that Reagan pack üö¨üí®
Reagan,2024-08-26,The greatest president of my lifetime.
Reagan,2024-06-06,They really should‚Äôve gotten Zach Hadel to be Reagan‚Ä¶.
Reagan,2024-06-06,Biopics just keep getting worse and worse.
Reagan,2024-06-06,Show the part where Reagan hit us with the Reaganomics and trickle-down economics.
Reagan,2024-07-20,It‚Äôs hard to make a movie like this that pleases everyone.
Reagan,2024-08-27,"Every single movie trailer now has an old song, original or pretentious cover, as the theme.  Usually right on the nose like this one.  Musical creativity is now ancient lost technology."
Reagan,2024-07-22,Dennis Quaid gave a spot on imitation of Reagan!
Reagan,2024-06-06,TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS
Reagan,2024-06-15,Last great president America has had. We need him back
Reagan,2024-08-16,Reagan was a great president
Reagan,2024-06-07,Ronald Reagan was awesome they don‚Äôt make men like them anymore

Reagan,2024-08-17,love this guy - the prez and the actor
Reagan,2024-08-07,Scott Stapp from Creed was hired to play Sinatra in this movie. üòÇ

The Forge,2023-11-17,"Reading all the comments thus far, I‚Äôm grateful that they are all very positive. There‚Äôs one comment that could be questionable but I won‚Äôt argue about the intent (I always see the glass half full), but what I will say is that a lot of people‚Äôs lives always look the same too. BUT GLORY TO GOD, HE doesn‚Äôt allow us to stay that way. He accepts us just as we are, &amp; as we allow Him to mold us, shape us &amp; fashion us by the washing of His Word (Ephesians 5:26) our lives become transformed into the image of His Son, Jesus The Christ, hence we are FORGE (no pun intendedüòÜ). Our God is The Awesome God. Situations may change, circumstances may change &amp; even people may change, but our God, Jehovah Yahew remains the same yesterday, today &amp; forever. And if that gets old &amp; stale for anybody then a person hasn‚Äôt come &amp; tasted to know that The Lord is Good &amp; His mercy endures forever (Psalm 136:1). I‚Äôll be glad to go to the cinema to see this movieü•∞"

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,"Kevin Costner truly is a legend in the Western genre, and this movie looks like it&#39;s going to be another masterpiece. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the big screen!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,This looks absolutely insane. The fact that Kevin backed this with his own money is legendary.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-28,This looks absolutely insane
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,Costner keeping the western genre alive. Love to see it.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,"Costner gives us a reason to go back to the movies this summer. Can&#39;t wait. &#39;Open Range&#39; is one of the best Western&#39;s of all time, ready to see what he brings us here."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,"This has that timeless filmic quality that is sorely missing too often from the silver screen nowadays. It feels like it could have come out in the 80s, 90s or 00s and I love it."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-28,Kevin Costner proving he&#39;s not just a talented actor but also a fearless filmmaker. Putting his money where his passion is! Can&#39;t wait to see what he brings to the screen this time!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-03,Western + Costner = Gold
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-01,As a John Ford fan this is really making me cry. Haven&#39;t seen a Western epic of this caliber in a long time. Hopefully it will be another masterpiece from Kevin Costner. Can&#39;t wait!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-02,This looks amazing. üôå Definitely 90&#39;s western vibe. Will see this the day it releases!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-02,"Not really a Western fan, but I appreciate it when an artist puts his money on the line to create something he loves."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Westerns are my favorite genre - so versatile for good storytelling. They need to be more common again!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-20,"In the late 80&#39;s, Kevin ran into difficulty securing the financing for Dances with Wolves and several movie studios rejected the project along the way. He was told then the Western genre was dead and the film too long. Not one to be deterred by the naysayers, he pushed forward to put it all together. The end result was a picture that won 7 Academy awards, grossed over $400 million worldwide (1990 dollars) and was named by critics as one of the best films of that year. As history shows, this is an actor/director who has the guts to forge his own path. Hats off to you, Mr. Costner, for taking another gamble with this latest Western. I for one hope this upcoming film will have a scene reminiscent of the buffalo hunt with the Lakota from Dances with Wolves (epic)."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,A good old fashioned western epic. Looking forward to seeing this.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-09,"Finally!!!!.... a film with real locations..,no bloody CGI..,no volume technology..,just pure cinema with awesome cinematography....THANKS!!!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,I love when Costner crafts westerns. So much soul!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Kevin Costner and Westerns are a match made in cinematic heaven.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-17,"Well, Kevin is a man to respect. He writes history and translates it into great films without leaving out the uncomfortable"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,Maaaaaaannn Kevin Costner is single handedly bringing back the Western. Can&#39;t wait for this.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-04-12,Looks like the kinda western we haven‚Äôt gotten in a long time
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,3 minutes of pure unadulterated CHILLS.<br><br>Welcome back CINEMA!!!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,I have a feeling this is going to be THE best western ever made. Kevin Costner is SIXTY NINE YEARS OLD. I will never forget the night I watched &#39;Dances With Wolves&#39; with my parents as a young teenager on a four channel tube display TV. We all sat there for three hours and never said a word even through the commercials. I took my young wife to a one off showing of the directors cut at the cinema and I had tears rolling down my face at the end scene. This is looking like another masterpiece from Kevin Costner.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,Kevin Costner never disappoints this looks incredible üî•
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,what a Trailer...feels like Red Dead Redemption all over again...that kick shot was amazing!!!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,Kevin Costner is to Westerns what Martin Scorsese is to Mafia films. You can&#39;t get much better
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-26,"My dad and I loved watching westerns together, this one looks like one he would have loved.   Movies like this do what movie should do--they move you.  If the trailer is going to be a good indicator, I am so in...."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,"For all the impact that these movies had on the last season of Yellowstone, it looks like it will have been worth it. This may be Kevin Costner&#39;s last hurrah as an epic American director and storyteller, and I suspect he is set to deliver what will become a classic film in American cinematic history, right up there with Dances with Wolves. Now I understand why he fought so damn hard to get these movies made. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the silver screen!!!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,"It‚Äôs still incredible how short a period the ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù was, but has burnt such a hot mark into the American psyche, and by extension the world."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-09,"Harry Carey to John Wayne to Clint Eastwood to Kevin Costner. Thank you, Costner, for continuing the great Western genre!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-20,"He&#39;s gonna do it again y&#39;all - Kevin Costner doesn&#39;t play, he is the real deal and I appreciate him and his work so much. Thank you sir."

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-28,Kevin Costner is now the GOAT of all Western style shows and movies.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-06-16,"I already love it for using a traditional cinematography, instead of the modern dark, Netflix type, with the same color grading as all the mass produced movies and shows"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,Feels like the good old days of good movies.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-04-26,Leone and Morricone will be looking down with a smile‚Ä¶ Costner has taken the reigns of the Western genre‚Ä¶
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,Written and Directed by Costner? Lets go baby
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-03,"Through Open Range, Costner gives us a link back to the great western days of Ford and Wayne. Looking forward to this!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-13,"I think that westerns are the only time Costner shines. I&#39;m not saying any other movie he&#39;s made is bad, but when he&#39;s in a period piece, he always does such a great job. üòäüòä"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-04,Just read that Kevin Costner&#39;s 13-year-old son is making his film debut! You can see him about a minute into the trailer. He&#39;s the kid helping some women (who we think are his mother and sister) into the hidden shelter in the floor. This movie looks so good. I&#39;m psyched!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,Been a while since we had a proper epic Western. Costner always delivers with his
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-06-14,"<b>Watching Dances with Wolves for the 1XXth time and 1st time on Youtube, got this Ad, perfect placement, I don&#39;t need to think. I know I&#39;m gonna watch each chapter. LEGEND Kostner. LEGEND.</b>"

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-01,Can&#39;t wait. No one these days makes westerns like Kevin Costner.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-05,"This is why I am a fan of Warner Bros. The classics, westerns and a full cinematic experience sci-fi‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs go!!"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-27,"I will never not be excited for a western, the greatest genre for me, glad Costner agrees."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,"Costner made probably the most well-made western of all time, Dances With Wolves. So this is exciting."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-26,And the clash of the titans begins! Sheridan vs Costner!<br>I can&#39;t wait for this one already.

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-27,"Doesn‚Äôt it look great. The master of film, brought to the screen. What a great human being. Kevin Costner your parents would be so proud. As we all are. Master of your craft. Thankyouüòä"
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-03-02,This will go down as the greatest western of all time.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-20,"This is actually exciting for someone like me who was weaned on the classics ‚Äî  Hondo, The Searchers, How The West Was Won, Broken Arrow, Red River, Shane, The Ox-Bow Incident, True Grit, Jeremiah Johnson, and The Cowboys. Though made for television, Lonesome Dove is a classic in its own right. But there have been very few really good westerns since the John Wayne, James Stewart, Henry Fonda era. I can really count them on one hand ‚Äî Silverado, Dances With Wolves, Tombstone, Open Range, and Broken Trail (also made for television by American Movie Classics). Westerns are by far my favorite purely American movie genre. So I&#39;m definitely all in and grateful that Kevin Costner has seen fit to make this saga and hope it&#39;s a winner for him."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-20,Can&#39;t wait<br>Westerns are my all time favorite. Eastwood and Costner are the best at least in my lifetime.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-27,"J. Michael Muro is the Cinematographer of both the Horizon films coming out this summer. He was the Cinematographer with Kevin on Open Range  as well as the movie Crash which won three Oscars, including Best Picture. This info is not mentioned in the description above. J. Michael worked as a Steadicam Operator on Field of Dreams where he met Kevin. He also worked on Dances with Wolves and JFK as a camera operator and steadicam operator. Kevin and J.

Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-02,"This looks amazing. I am hyped to see this! As a fan of the western genre, there are so few westerns these days that feel authentic. This feels organic and I love that."
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-29,Kevin Costner in a western? The best!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-04-20,emotional trailer! the music alone is oscar-worthy! bring tissues to this film!
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-02-28,I love Kevin Costner epics. Has any single actor done as many as he has? His whole career he constantly wants to make 3+ hour films. And his tend to actually be watchable- even when they&#39;re bad.
Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,2024-05-21,Kevin Costner does everything in a grandiose fashion. I love it! Can‚Äôt wait to see this!

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,Johnny Cash is revealed at the end of this trailer like he&#39;s a goddamn MCU cameo
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-20,"I wish my Dad was alive to see this, I&#39;ll see it for both of us. This would make him so happy. I grew up listening to my Dads music, he loved all music, couldn&#39;t sing at all, he was an artist. I&#39;d sit on the floor in his studio watching him paint and listen to Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, Springsteen, Queen, everything..miss you Dad ‚ù§"
A Complete Unknown,2024-11-21,"My older brother, Guy, was friends with Bob, back when he first came Upstate from NYC, until around &#39;65, when Bob became too big to drop in at our house. I was lucky to have watched the young Bobby play right in our living room in Schenectady, NY. No film will ever compare to those real memories, but I hope the filmmakers really tried with this one."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,Perfect time to release a Dylan movie. While he&#39;s alive and well to help produce it. This will be phenomenal
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"‚Äúyou can be beautiful, or you can be ugly, but you can‚Äôt be plain‚Äù"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,My dad always played bob dylan when I was growing up. I guess that&#39;s how I fell  in love with his music. I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE.
A Complete Unknown,2024-12-20,"My Father introduced me to Bob Dylan‚Äôs music in the 80ies when I was just a young kid. I got hooked instantly! At the time it was mostly Dylan‚Äôs 80‚Äôs tunes &amp; onward. It wasn‚Äôt until my Dad was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia in 2020 before I heard Dylan‚Äôs original and older albums. He would sit down for hours listening to The Freewheelin‚Äô Album. Eye‚Äôs closed, foot stomping, &amp; singing from his soul! It‚Äôs almost like the whole world stopped and everything was going to be ok with what my Dad was battling. This album was his medicine and not only did it help him, it helped me. There is not a day that I don‚Äôt put that album on. It pulls me away from all the world‚Äôs nonsense and BS. I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie! Rest Easy Pop‚Äôs! üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è üé∂"

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-11,"I was never a huge Dylan fan but the two trailers for this movie have unlocked a much deeper appreciation for his song writing ability. &quot;Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm, When the rivers freeze and summer ends, Please see if she‚Äôs wearing a coat so warm, To keep her from the howlin‚Äô winds&quot;...what a poetic lyrics."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,The Bob Dylan impression was way better than I expected. Hopefully to see this bringing Timothee Chalamet back to the Oscars

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,From Wonka to Dune to this. Timothee chalamet range is unbelievable.
A Complete Unknown,2024-11-04,"Good lord, I remember 10-12 years ago, watching almost all the old interviews, songs, videos of Boy Dylan, anything available on YouTube at that time, I used to watch it all.<br>And Timothee looks sooo much like Bob Dylan with his style, his looks, his mannerisms, gestures.. I was blown away into the wind with this trailer."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,Watching this brought me to tears. I‚Äôm 72.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"As a Bob Dylan obsessive, I&#39;m telling you right now that Timothee NAILED this. Can&#39;t wait."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-11,This whole trailer is life-affirming.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"Can&#39;t wait to see this guy teaming up with Elton John, Freddie Mercury, The Beatles, David Bowie, Elvis Presley to save Michael Jackson from Doctor Doom in the Multiverse"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"Ok this looks like it‚Äôs gonna be good. I was never worried about Timothee‚Äôs acting, it‚Äôs the singing I was skeptical about. But he sounds great. I‚Äôll be watching!"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,That&#39;s some trailer. Can&#39;wait. Timothee looks fine as Dylan. Fingers crossed.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,This is absolutely wonderful!  Can&#39;t wait for the film.  Way to go Tim
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,The trailer alone pretty much guarantees an Oscar nomination.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-26,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> Look at Edward Norton&#39;s eyes saying &quot;are you gonna meet with your expectations&quot; ?  Seems to me that&#39;s the message of the movie."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,Timoth√©e gunning for that Oscar!
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,Honestly can&#39;t wait to see this. Chalamet feels perfect for this.

A Complete Unknown,2024-11-20,Been a Dylan fan since I was in middle school. Nearly 40 now and am so excited to see this film with a great cast and an equally great director. Mangold is a suburb choice.
A Complete Unknown,2024-11-01,Chalamet can act for sure. ü´°üëèüíØ

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"While I am excited to see Timoth√©e as Bob, I‚Äôm also curious to see Monica Barbaro‚Äôs portrayal of Joan Baez too. <br><br>She really nailed Joan‚Äôs speech patterns perfectly at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc&amp;t=42"">0:42</a>!"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-10,Timoth√©e Chalamet was born to play this role! I had goose bumps during the whole trailer!
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-10,"Looking forward to this one!  My fav Dylan memory: several yrs ago, while visiting Limerick IR, while I was ordering takeaway coffees at Abbey River Coffee, Dylan&#39;s &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; started playing on the shop&#39;s audio system.  That epic snare drum snap! After a few moments, myself, the barista, and another customer started singing the song out loud at same time.  We smiled at each other!"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,Not even a Bob Dylan fan but I&#39;ll be watching this once it streams because Chalamet is a talent that can&#39;t be missed.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,I¬¥m going to be watching because of Timoth√©e but I¬¥m so excited to learn more about Bob! I just went to listen to the songs that appear in this trailer and they are gooood.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,"Okay, I am on board with this. That TC fellow actually does sound like the Zimmerman. And I think this might be a pretty fair biopic."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"It takes a lot of gumption, fearlessness, confidence to dive in a project like this one.  Looking forward to it!"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-12,"Once Like A Rolling Stone started the chills came on too, Timothee sounds awesome and perfectly captured the vibe of that song with his voice, he isn&#39;t trying to sound EXACTLY like Dylan, he is trying to embody the way Dylan sang and from what i heard he has done it."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"A feel good movie on Christmas, that&#39;s all what I wantedüòä"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,James Mangold is a fantastic director
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-17,"I know this actor is everywhere, but he looks like young Bob Dylan. He‚Äôs great for this role."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,James Mangold made a coming of age story about Johnny Cash. Now he uses this character as the wise person why gives advice in another story. James Mangold has earned the right to do so.
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,Finally a decent trailer that actually gets me excited for the movie instead of spoiling most of it
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,This is about the best goddamned American songwriter in recorded history. It better be good.

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,this movie would be a testament about how great and wide Timothee&#39;s acting range could be
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,timmy tim tim is such a GREAT actor man!!! üíó
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,"It‚Äôs finally here!<br>Being a devoted Dylan fan, I can say this seems way better than expected. Cate as Dylan was the best one for me but Chalamet here ü§å‚ú® The voice Chalamet‚Äôs voice ü§å<br>This better get him an oscar"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,"The way Timoth√©e Chalamet can portray totally different characters in a way that you don&#39;t even see it&#39;s him underneath that new personality is so amazing and just shows how much of a versatile actor he is, TRULY one of the best actors of these days and no matter how much you hate him or be sick to see is face on the big screen ‚Äî if he became a big name on the industry is because he definitely has something special over all the other actors. He&#39;s going for his first Oscar for this role (and it&#39;s gonna be VERY well deserved), write it down"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,I‚Äôm a bob Dylan Fan and he‚Äôs voice in this is pretty good tbh üòÖ

A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,"I love Bob Dylan, in turn, I love that Timothee Chalamet is playing him"
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,As a die hard Dylan fan I validate the impression
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,"Not typically a fan of Chamalet, but his singing is on point. Definitely will catch this when it comes out."
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-10,Mangold + Chalamet + Norton + Fanning... I&#39;m in!üî•
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-22,I bet on Timoth√©e Chalamet and James Mangold&#39;s movie to win an Oscar. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
A Complete Unknown,2024-12-04,I saw this film at a special screening 12/2/24.  It was so good I wanted to watch it again right then.  Amazing film.  Cannot overstate how great this was.  I&#39;ll definitely be there again on the 25th‚ù§
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-08,This is the first time I&#39;ve ever bought Chalamet in any role honestly lol seems like he knocked it out of the park
A Complete Unknown,2024-10-09,Looks good.  I want to see this one in the theater.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,This had potential on being horrifyingly good especially the concept about a imaginary friend being a evil supernatural force is very intriguing to me
Imaginary,2023-11-17,Not at all what I expected for Ted 3 but I&#39;m ready
Imaginary,2023-11-19,Can we talk about the song ‚ÄúJust my Imagination‚Äù  by the legendary Temptations. Love how movies/trailers  sample classic throwbacks
Imaginary,2023-11-17,As soon as I saw bro sitting alone in the attic..I knew üò≠ This looks so good!
Imaginary,2023-11-17,"I recall this being a Creepy Pasta where the imaginary friend kept asking the little girl to do things that were becoming increasingly dangerous, and at one point she refused. I think the last thing he wanted her to do was jump off the top of her stairs, but she refused and wanted nothing more to do with the imaginary friend. The thing is, it promised her that it would take her to where it came from and she still refused. Then, the parents tell her that they&#39;re moving, and as the were driving away with the mover truck, she looked back at her bedroom window and she saw this fucking demon, this grown ass man looking demon just wave at her from her bedroom window. The girl eventually grew up and many years later she explored the area and discovered that the place that the &quot;imaginary friend&quot; wanted to take her to was a graveyard. I think that&#39;s where they got the idea for this movie, or maybe it an adaptation of that."
Imaginary,2023-11-24,For the last two years years in horror original projects this been killing it. Glad to see a lot of it recently
Imaginary,2023-11-18,"Blumhouse really putting all their stocks into horror movies about relatively innocent things. M3GAN is a horror film about a evil AI toy, FNaF is based on a game about possessed Chuck E Cheese, and now Imaginary with imaginary friends. I‚Äôm fucking here for it man, this is awesome!"
Imaginary,2024-03-05,Really like the maybe we shouldn&#39;t be friends line delivery felt real/genuine
Imaginary,2023-11-16,I have been waiting for this! It looks so atmospheric and suspenseful. I will be in that theater on day one!
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Wow. This looks good. If this movie is as good as this trailer, I could see this joining the ranks of the horror classics."
Imaginary,2024-03-07,I watched this and proceeded to look at my net of stuffed animals and say &quot;I love all of you please don&#39;t kill me&quot;
Imaginary,2023-11-16,Im intrigued. I think this movie has some great potential especially since it&#39;s the same producer behind the invisible man and  black phone. I like the idea with what they are doing with imaginary friends a lot of times they are usually demons or ghosts but here they seem to be their own sort if beings so I&#39;m interested to see what they do with this idea.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Ok, Chauncey&#39;s monstrous form is legit terrifying. I know the director wrote and directed some of Blumhouse&#39;s worst films in recent memory (Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island), but this has a lot of potential to be really imaginative and very creepy.<br>I&#39;m definitely keeping my eye out for this one."
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"I remember, in the early 2010s, that somebody was talking on an IMDb message board,that there should be a movie like this. And I remember commenting that BlumHouse would probably produce it. Talk about a prophecy come true. üòÇ"
Imaginary,2023-12-15,Two movies about Imaginary friends popping up in my feed. what a twist.
Imaginary,2023-12-07,It‚Äôs Always those hallway scenes with the running jumpscare üò≠üò≠üò≠
Imaginary,2023-11-16,This is one of those trailers where it&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;ll be really stupid or actually good. It looks like a coin-flip so far.
Imaginary,2023-11-21,Great concept! Finally something that‚Äôs not a remake. We need more original movies and great theme music
Imaginary,2023-12-04,"I&#39;m totally down for this movie! It honestly looks pretty intense, haunting, and reminds me just a tiny bit of the movie Hide and Seek (which I don&#39;t know how many people even remember that) but wow. I&#39;ve been accused of giving a movie a free pass just for having a high concept premise or having an actor I really like in it--this one is definitely gonna be pretty high on my watchlist. Fingers crossed it&#39;s &#39;The Gift&#39; Blumhouse and not &#39;Unfriended&#39; Blumhouse."
Imaginary,2023-11-20,The fact it‚Äôs being worked on with Blum house means it‚Äôs gonna be great
Imaginary,2023-11-17,I will definitely be tuning into this movie when it releases. This looks promising and i am always looking forward to new original horor movies!
Imaginary,2023-11-16,hello other people who r mad early on this ü§≠
Imaginary,2023-11-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=78"">1:18</a><br>The voice is epic!!!!!!"
Imaginary,2023-11-19,That evil teddy bear is absolutely hilarious.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,Chauncey is gonna be an icon I can already tell.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,Okay. You know what? This looks promising.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,I can‚Äôt wait to see this!! Such a cute little teddy bear! üêª
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Blumhouse killing it again, literally üòÇ"
Imaginary,2023-11-18,Imaginary will have us seeking for answers until the end. It&#39;s giving psychological thriller/horror vibes. What goes in your mind isn&#39;t all what it seems.
Imaginary,2023-11-17,That shot of the creepy glowing blue child‚Äôs door in the wall gave me Coraline vibes üíÄ can‚Äôt wait to watch this
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Finally, a horror movie that isn&#39;t a remake or a sequel of a beloved horror movie. This gives off Chucky vibe to it, with the supernatural stuff like Incideus. Hopefully it all works out"
Imaginary,2023-12-10,That shot of the teddy bear slowly turning its head is the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen in a trailer in months. Hilarious.
Imaginary,2023-12-27,"I love this concept.‚ù§ I saw this in the previews at a movie theater, and when the whole checklist part came along, I had no idea it was a horror movie until the part where the bear wanted the girl to hurt herself! The checklist idea is so good though! Can‚Äôt wait to see how the movie turns out!"
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Although we can tell the bear is pretty much moving through animatronics, its done well enough to look scary/real. Like &quot;that&#39;s how a horror themed doll would move&quot;.  <br>It&#39;s amusing how it was moving through the floor in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=130"">2:10</a>. We all know how that was done in production."
Imaginary,2023-11-17,Am I alone in finding this the most hysterically funny trailer I‚Äôve ever seen??
Imaginary,2023-11-20,"Okay! I have to share a story!! <br>I had an imaginary friend for many years, I would say things like &quot;you can&#39;t sit there, it&#39;s Tommy&#39;s spot&quot;  I talked to him, played with him etc.  Fast forward to 6th grade, my sister and I were fist fighting, and pieces of the popcorn ceiling fell between us. Like  A LOT of it. We didn&#39;t think too much of it, but a few months later we were fighting again and the kitchen cabinets flung open, fast. <br>We stopped immediately. <br>I would get into fights at school and feel SO much anger! I didn&#39;t understand it because I was typically a calm person. <br>Fast forward 10 years I&#39;m about 20 yrs old and start going to church, a lady approached me and said she had a feeling I was being influenced by a demon, and I&#39;ve allowed it because It keeps me safe. <br>She had me come to her house for an exorcism, and oh my gosh!! I was ANGRY, I was spitting at her, I told her I wanted to punch her, like it was BAD. then she says, &quot;I demand you tell me your name!&quot; My voice got so deep it sounded like a man and I said &quot;Tommy!&quot; I was SO angry by now, I told her that I wanted to attack her, so her husband and son put their hands on my shoulders and held my arms gently. The chandelier over her table started to swing and I laughed so wicked! <br>But then her husband, son and her started praying in the spirit demanding that the demon let go of me in Jesus name! I started coughing and yawning and felt sick.  I felt this overpowering need to sneeze HARD. I did, and then I became overwhelmed with peace and joy and happiness. After that day I never got into a fist fight again, I never felt the urge to attack or physically harm anyone again. I was free and delivered. <br>Long story short, do not let your children have imaginary friends!"
Imaginary,2023-11-16,Ohh wow.. that&#39;s so creepy.. loved the trailer.. waiting for 2024 üëåüèºüëçüèºüëèüèº
Imaginary,2023-11-19,Did anybody else&#39;s mind instantly think of the song Teddy Bear by Melanie Martinez when they saw this trailer? It definitely fits!
Imaginary,2023-11-17,"Man that new Foster&#39;s Home remake looks sick<br><br><br>Jokes aside, that sounds like it could be a perfect film<br><br><br>edit: it&#39;s not sadly"
Imaginary,2023-11-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=1"">0:01</a> is when i started screaming ‚ÄúFREDDY FAZBEAR‚Äù"
Imaginary,2024-03-07,Child‚Äôs play has brought us a long way üòä
Imaginary,2023-11-17,"I Want to see this film, as it has a great concept. But I wasn‚Äôt expecting this silhouette jumpscare at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=117"">1:57</a> üò¨!"
Imaginary,2024-03-04,"Jordan Peele&#39;s influence on the horror industry, even down to the way that trailers are made, is WILD"
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=60"">1:00</a> im tempted to do a compilation of all the bits in Blumhouse film trailers where the &quot;producer of&quot; credits come out&quot;"
Imaginary,2023-12-16,I‚Äôm so happy to see ‚Äúfrom the creators of Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs‚Äù
Imaginary,2023-11-16,This definitely looks interesting and I&#39;m really curious what Chauncey REALLY is
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"This is gonna be insane, I can&#39;t wait!"
Imaginary,2023-11-17,The Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary Friends reboot took a very interesting turn.
Imaginary,2023-11-16,The imaginary friends turning bad has been done before in Disney&#39;s Dont Look Under The Bed but I&#39;m looking forward to an R-rated version of it.
Imaginary,2023-11-17,Bloo from Foster‚Äôs Home was never the same after Mac grew up üò¢
Imaginary,2023-11-18,This looks like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look under the bed‚Äù+ ‚ÄúBlack mirror‚Äôs mom soul in a teddy bear episode‚Äù+ ‚Äúinsidious‚Äù = TERRIFYINGLY DISTURBINGLY GOOD
Imaginary,2024-02-09,&quot;IT WAS JUST MY IMAGINATION&quot;üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Imaginary,2023-11-18,"Looks like Alice is the reason Chauncey became a physical threat. It looks like the list of ‚Äúgames‚Äù he had her do were more like ways to summon her, and he needed the blood of an innocent person to complete said ritual. I could be wrong but this seems very familiar."
Imaginary,2023-11-16,Here I thought I was watching a trailer for a live action remake of fosters home for imaginary friends.
Imaginary,2024-02-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=78"">1:18</a> epic voice and mutant"
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"Crypt Keeper: Crypt Keeper here kiddies and speaking of kiddies, tonight&#39;s sickening saga should be subtitled a &quot;Tale from the Crib.&quot; Yes, fear fans. I&#39;ve got a real nursery crime for you this time. It&#39;s all about the Consequences of having an Imaginary Friend. So call the babysitter and break out the barf bags as I narrate a nauseating novella. I affectionately call this one &quot;Imaginary.&quot;"
Imaginary,2023-11-16,"It&#39;s a frightening story from the creator of Megan+Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s+The Invisible Man+ The Black Phone. That&#39;s enough to guarantee it. Interestingly, Imaginary means imagination.üêªüë©üò±üò±üíÄüé¨"
Imaginary,2024-01-11,this actually is a really well made trailer. I was legitimately questioning whether or not this was an actual commercial for a minute
Imaginary,2023-11-25,"I was dying of laughter in the theater at this part üòÇ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoNfrgrAGM&amp;t=83"">1:23</a> <br>Can‚Äôt wait to see it"
Imaginary,2023-11-17,"I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but this looks promising! Horror has been so whack this last decade, I&#39;m excited for a different premise!"
Heretic,2024-06-25,I want to kiss whoever thought &#39;we should start using Hugh Grant in more edgy roles&#39;. He&#39;s a joy to watch outside of romantic comedies.
Heretic,2024-06-25,The cut to a blueberry pie candle and the realization that there is actually no pie. Love it.
Heretic,2024-06-28,"finally, a film that captures the unspeakable horror of a scented candle."
Heretic,2024-06-25,This new era of villanous roles for Hugh Grant is really fun
Heretic,2024-06-25,"Not giving away the entire plot or relying on a barrage of jump scares, simply introducing the setting and building the atmosphere. Yeah, that was a well-made trailer."
Heretic,2024-07-02,My worst fear. <br><br>There&#39;s no pie.
Heretic,2024-06-27,Shout out A24 for simply having a picture of Hugh Grant for a thumbnail because I was like &quot;Hugh Grant?....in a A24 movie?&quot;... and now I&#39;m looking forward to watch this movie!
Heretic,2024-06-25,A24 sure loves models of houses and such lol
Heretic,2024-07-01,Im so glad theyve gone back to making previews that only show you enough to make you want to see it
Heretic,2024-06-26,Hugh Grant: &quot;do not be afraid.&quot;<br><br>Everyone: &quot;already shat my pants.&quot;
Heretic,2024-06-25,I never realized that Hugh Grant would make a great psycho killer
Heretic,2024-06-25,I&#39;ve never been so happy for an actor to outlive their romcom years. Hugh Grant is a powerhouse and he finally gets to show off his range üëè
Heretic,2024-07-01,All of those years that he was type casted in Romcoms may have paid the bills but this is the type of role that Hugh should be in! Can&#39;t wait to see this!
Heretic,2024-07-12,High Grant is so perfect at acting in a way that‚Äôs disarming and then switching on a dime while still being charming‚Ä¶ incredible!
Heretic,2024-06-27,"THIS is how trailers should be done, and not a montage of the whole movie. I&#39;m now interested to see it."
Heretic,2024-07-01,"HG&#39;s character answers the door, holding a watering can on a rainy day. He says his wife is &quot; home.&quot; He lights the blueberry pie candle right in front of them. If this character wanted to do something discreetly, it seems like he would. It&#39;s like he&#39;s testing how far he can go on the strength of the ladies&#39; subconscious acceptance of what he says versus what their environment demonstrates. <br>I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this!"
Heretic,2024-06-25,"I&#39;m all for this Maze Runner reboot. It&#39;s got a maze, it&#39;s got runners, it&#39;s got it all."
Heretic,2024-06-28,Love the awkward face he pulls when he says ‚Äúit may even make you want to die‚Äù<br>Classic Grant.
Heretic,2024-06-25,Hugh Grant is the master of... The pause.
Heretic,2024-07-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> i absolutely love how he says this to them, an obvious reference to angels. it‚Äôs such a simple yet effective line."
Heretic,2024-06-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=9"">0:09</a> that‚Äôs the most A24 looking staircase"
Heretic,2024-06-25,‚ÄúHugh Grant‚Äù and ‚ÄúA24‚Äù. YESSIR.
Heretic,2024-09-08,Three things: 1) A trailer opening with The Hollies Air that I Breathe will always grab my attention; 2) casting Hugh Grant in a horror film is a stroke of genius; 3) the film generally looks brilliant and gives me future classic vibes
Heretic,2024-06-27,"Life is crazy, I&#39;m 32 and seeing Hugh Grant older is making me realize how fast it all goes..."
Heretic,2024-06-30,Hugh Grant just seems like he&#39;s having fun with every new role these days and I love that for him
Heretic,2024-06-28,"Ever since Hugh Grant‚Äôs amazing performance in the Gentlemen, he has been taking his career in a very different direction and I love it!"
Heretic,2024-06-26,What a second act for Hugh&#39;s career.
Heretic,2024-07-02,"The movie is called Heretic and ties into the history of the word as it has been associated with the history of the Christian religion as the word is based on the Ancient Greek word: Haeretikos, which means, &quot;I choose&quot;.<br><br>Brilliant title and movie theming."
Heretic,2024-07-14,I love what Hugh Grant is doing with his career. Playing on people&#39;s perceptions of him must be so much fun!
Heretic,2024-06-25,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> &quot;It may even make you want to die&quot; followed by that little grimace that he makes ... so masterful!"
Heretic,2024-06-27,"The way he just puts the candle out there,in front of those girls is just genius. They have no idea what&#39;s about to hit them."
Heretic,2024-06-25,Probably the one time their Zone Leaders aren‚Äôt checking to make sure they‚Äôre in their apartment by 9pm haha IYKYK
Heretic,2024-06-25,"Love this move for Hugh, he&#39;s always had a great dark side but doesn&#39;t always get to show it off"
Heretic,2024-06-27,"The pie candle was right in front of them the entire time. You can see it lit on the table and facing them when he&#39;s still in the room. He never hid it from them, he allowed them to be victims of their own willing belief in what they were told when the truth was in front of them. This was his first test, more than just a trap.<br>I think at every step he will push them to abandon the given information that they want to believe and instead use their minds and senses in the present moment in order to survive, to overcome comforting misinformation and see if they can pursue their best interests in extremity."
Heretic,2024-06-30,"Sophie Thatcher was the main reason I stayed with Yellowjackets, Hugh Grant in a horror film is the main reason I&#39;d watch this. Looking devilishly grandeur."
Heretic,2024-07-11,"The differing reactions of the two girls to the candle could highlight their personalities and how they respond to danger, possibly setting up a dynamic where one is more skeptical and the other more trusting."
Heretic,2024-06-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> that &quot;everything&quot; delivery paired with a very eerie, sinister and psycho smile. <br>Gosh, I love Hugh Grant. Such a terrific actor. <br>I bet this will become one of my future classic faves."
Heretic,2024-06-25,The amount of people I&#39;ve seen ask why the girl got scared when she saw the blueberry pie candle is concerning.
Heretic,2024-06-26,The lad built himself quite the elaborate house just hoping two girls from the local church would show up on his doorstep and fall for his blueberry candle trick.  I imagine he&#39;s relieved all those years of laborious construction and patience paid off.
Heretic,2024-07-01,"I REALLY try not to get too hyped up for any trailers, but this one got me."
Heretic,2024-06-26,I for one am loving every step of Hugh Grant&#39;s rebellious phase.
Heretic,2024-06-25,Mr. Grant is quite the voice/speech virtuoso. That &quot;Everything&quot; is pure asmr.
Heretic,2024-06-25,I&#39;ve said this YEARS ago!<br>Hugh Grant playing a killer would blow everybody&#39;s minds! Glad I&#39;m not the only one who saw the potential.
Heretic,2024-06-25,"&quot;I am also just a psychopath, standing in front of two girls asking them to pick their door&quot;"
Heretic,2024-06-27,"Hugh Grant just must be loving these new, darker roles. He is so self deprecating, I hope he knows how much pleasure he brings with his work"
Heretic,2024-08-19,"Glad to see Hollywood finally starting to get it right with the trailers; showing just enough, and not tryna cramp the entire movie into a 3-minute montage with overused sound effects. The trailer for &quot;Longlegs&quot; blew my mind, too... Absolutely love to see it. Bravo, A24!!!"
Heretic,2024-08-09,"My far-fetched theory: it‚Äôs a storyline similar to the Greek mythology about the Minotaur that resides in the middle of the labyrinth. Each year they would send in youths and maidens into the labyrinth as a sacrificial offering to the Minotaur (he eats them). <br><br>This old guy seems like a mad scientist/inventor and maybe he somehow was able to reanimate his dead wife and she‚Äôs now like some zombie lady who needs to be trapped inside the maze he created. Her ‚Äúresurrection from the dead‚Äù is why he said they‚Äôd witness a miracle. He sends in people into the maze to feed her. <br><br>Hey man, like I said, far-fetched theory."
Heretic,2024-06-27,"I can&#39;t believe we are back in the era of good trailers that are actually gripping and don&#39;t tell already the whole movie. Well done, A24! üëçüèª Nosferatu has an equally good trailer and I am here for it."
Heretic,2024-06-25,Thank you A24 and Neon for filling the horror sized hole in my heart like Blumhouse never could.
Heretic,2024-06-29,Hugh Grant is just fantastic in these darker roles. When I first saw him as the villain in Paddington 2 my heart skipped a beat lol. Just brilliant
Heretic,2024-06-28,I love it when older actors who were famous when they were young reinvent themselves and become cool again for everyone to enjoy. Hugh Grant in this film is unexpected and fresh.üíó
Heretic,2024-07-14,Who remembers Hugh Grant in the film &#39;Cloud Atlas&#39; where he played the part of a terribly cruel  man? He said later that he&#39;d really enjoyed being a &#39;baddie&#39; for once. He was good...very good. ü§©
Heretic,2024-06-25,"The last 5-10 years of Hugh Grants career have been arguably his best. The money surely isn&#39;t the same as it was for him back when, but the performances he&#39;s been turning in lately have all been amongst his best career work"
Heretic,2024-07-04,"I like the fact Huge is using The British ACCENT instead of putting on an American accent for commercial purposes, The English accent is Internationally Respected"
Heretic,2024-07-02,For those wondering. Wiki says its scheduled to be released on nov 15th
Heretic,2024-06-25,"hugh grant looks like hes actually having fun making films again,"
Heretic,2024-06-25,Oompa loompa  is now John Kramer!
Heretic,2024-06-25,"As a former Mormon who served a mission, it&#39;s interesting to see realistic portrayals of Mormon missionaries being used as more than the butt of a joke. I can see how the strict set of morals and being homesick could add a lot to the plot of a thriller."
Heretic,2024-06-28,"No harsh language, no violence, no guns, no cell phones, just three people having a good discussion about faith and God."
Heretic,2024-06-25,As someone bakes and has dessert scented candles‚Ä¶my ass would‚Äôve thought he lit it to make more than the kitchen smell like pie üíÄ
Heretic,2024-06-25,"Whatever you think of the Latter-day Saint faith, major props for portaying the missionaries as actual human beings."
Heretic,2024-11-01,Just got home from watching this! I loved it!!!! It&#39;s like A24 meets Stephen King! A true psychological mind game!
Heretic,2024-06-25,"I will say this. Having done studies on LDS media depictions, i think this is the first time I‚Äôve seen sister missionaries shown in a movie or show not created by church owned or adjacent media. So that‚Äôs a first!<br><br>Curious to see the film too"
Heretic,2024-06-25,"I LOVE how he says ‚ÄúDo not be afraid,‚Äù in this context. If you think about it a bit, it might be read as him mimicking (or possibly BEING) God, (Be not afraid) and literally testing them, like he does all the time in the bible. This looks freaking cool!"
Heretic,2024-06-26,My stomach dropped when she clocked the blueberry pie candle. It&#39;s very reminiscent of the drink ordering scene in Inglorious Bastards.
Heretic,2024-06-25,"whenever i see somewhere A24,  i say &quot;man i respect you so much, i will see you on the biggest screen, 4k possible&quot;"
Heretic,2024-06-27,"so many amazing clues/details in the first part of the trailer - him with the watering can despite it raining, obviously the candle, I suspect the framing of the girls in each shot foreshadows their fates ‚Ä¶ love it"
Heretic,2024-08-23,You know it&#39;s not gonna end good when some stranger offer you a pie.
Heretic,2024-08-29,That classic Hugh Grant downward smile works so well for this horror character! LOVE IT!
Heretic,2024-06-25,"Hugh Grant has been on a legendary roll since his performance in Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Gentlemen imo,  and I am here for it all. He&#39;s just a GEM of an actor in Comedy and Dramatic roles and so A24 is a Production company we can TRUST to deliver everytime!!!!"
Heretic,2024-06-27,Love the juxtaposition between the warm and cozy color grading in some scenes versus the impending doom. My favorite.
Heretic,2024-06-25,A24 is the breath of fresh air that the film industry needs!
Heretic,2024-06-27,Old school trailer. Give me intrigue without giving everything away. A fine art.
Heretic,2024-06-25,Just the shot of the candle saying &quot;blueberry pie&quot; and the atmospheric music already makes this a must see! A24 never dissapoints!
Heretic,2024-06-25,Hugh Grant as a villain is a brilliant career move by him. He plays these roles so well.
Heretic,2024-07-02,"I used to be a sister missionary. My first thought was‚Äîthey need to make sure another woman is present (not just trust his word), they probably have a trackable phone, and their district leader would‚Äôve called that night and known something was wrong if they didn‚Äôt answer. But I‚Äôm still intrigued! Hoping they are nice to the church in general"
Heretic,2024-06-25,"A24, horror, and miniature houses. Name a more iconic trio!"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"Would have been nice if they didn‚Äôt reveal what‚Äôs wrong with the girl in the trailer. Would have loved the curiosity and the suspense. <br>And also, I love how the tag line of this movie is: ‚Äúchildren can be such monsters.‚Äù Really takes it to a whole new level. üòçüòç"
Abigail,2024-01-12,"Looks pretty fun to be honest, so happy that old school monsters are getting so many cool releases recently and coming up"
Abigail,2024-01-13,"RIP Angus.......such a peaceful and powerful presence, on and off camera"
Abigail,2024-01-11,I&#39;m glad to see Melissa Barrera continuing her work in horror
Abigail,2024-01-11,"So basically ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trapped in here with you. You‚Äôre trapped in here with me‚Äù? Sure, sign me up"
Abigail,2024-01-12,A vampire? A ballerina? A vampire ballerina?! Looks like a breath of fresh air!
Abigail,2024-01-12,"Nobody is talking about this being possibly Angus Cloud‚Äôs final movie, I‚Äôm shocked to see him in the trailer. Regardless of the quality of this film, will be watching for him"
Abigail,2024-01-11,I love that the vampire genre is slowly coming back! This movie looks great!!
Abigail,2024-01-13,I love the return to fun horror. &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was such a blast to watch and this looks like it&#39;s very much continuing to bring the jumps and the laughs.
Abigail,2024-02-06,‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fucking flying‚Äù idk but that made me lol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Abigail,2024-01-14,"It‚Äôs wild when you realize the house isn‚Äôt locked down to trap them inside, it‚Äôs to keep Abigail from getting out at night!"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"Glad to see Alisha Weir in another project!  She killed it in Roald Dahl&#39;s Matilda the Musical and she&#39;s going to kill it here, metaphorically speaking."
Abigail,2024-03-25,"When Gus tricks you into being trapped in a manor with a vampiric ballerina, you&#39;d better call SaulüòÇ"
Abigail,2024-01-13,I love how they used the swan lake theme for this trailer because to me it&#39;s like a nod to back in Universal&#39;s Golden Age horror days when they used this as the opening theme for 1931&#39;s Dracula!
Abigail,2024-01-11,I&#39;m really interested in everything that this director duo does and this looks like an absolute blast.
Abigail,2024-02-29,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=135"">02:15</a> she delivered this line IMPECCABLY"
Abigail,2024-01-15,For anyone who remembers how terrifying Kirsten Dunst was in Interview with the Vampire‚Ä¶.this brought back memories üòÇüéâ
Abigail,2024-01-11,"Hell yeah, dude! Melissa Barrera, Angus Cloud, Dan Stevens, and Giancarlo are the reasons I want to see this movie (along with the fact that Radio Silence is working on this as well). I love the concept of the movie‚Äôs premise. I‚Äôve had my eyes on this movie for a while since I heard it was in development. It looks like the trailer for it is finally here. I‚Äôm definitely seeing it in the theater when it comes out"
Abigail,2024-04-02,"I love that they did a fourth-wall break and joked about some of the different vampire types, at the same time doing shout-outs and recognition for the people who have written the books or made the stories into film.<br><br>Anne Rice reference was awesome."
Abigail,2024-01-14,"This is giving strong 80s vamp vibes - that fun, bat$hit crazy Lost Boys/Fright Night aesthetic where the horror and humor actually work TOGETHER. Mixing that with a chamber-style, monster-on-the-loose, survive-the-night story is brilliant. Looks promising. Excellent trailer."
Abigail,2024-01-12,"Having once been an evil little girl myself, I have to say this is totally my jam"
Abigail,2024-01-11,&quot;I&#39;m sorry about what&#39;s gonna happen to you&quot; got me üíÄ
Abigail,2024-01-11,I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING FROM THIS TRAILER BUT IT WAS NOWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT I JUST SAW. THIS LOOKS GOOD PERIODT
Abigail,2024-02-28,OMG! It&#39;s the first time I want the &quot;Monster&quot; to win. She&#39;s so cute ü§£
Abigail,2024-04-10,"This movie kind of reminds me of Don&#39;t Breathe, a film about a group of criminals, who commit a crime against someone, whom they think is a harmless person; but that person later turns out to be something much more sinister."
Abigail,2024-01-11,"I‚Äôve had my eyes on this one for a while because I loved Ready or Not and the SCREAM ‚Äúrequels‚Äù, and yeah, this looks like a blast. I remember reading that this was supposed to be tied to an existing character within the Universal Monsters IP, so, based on the trailer, it seems the rumors about said character being Dracula are true, but I‚Äôd love if it was its own original thing not attatched to any existing characters"
Abigail,2024-01-12,This actually looks like an absolute blast. Definitely going on the watchlist!
Abigail,2024-01-11,"I know not everyone liked Scream V and VI, but Radio Silence have yet to disappoint me. On top of that, the cast here is freaking stacked! I can&#39;t wait."
Abigail,2024-01-12,I‚Äôm so glad that Melissa is booked and busy with her acting career. I also love how Kathryn Newton is booked and busy with horror as she will be also starring in Lisa Frankenstein this year!
Abigail,2024-01-11,So happy to see Angus‚Äôs work carrying on. Mellissa in this as well? I‚Äôm excited for this one.
Abigail,2024-03-26,"Nice touch, using Swan Lake as a motif throughout. Not only is it connected to Abigail&#39;s ballet skills, but it&#39;s also the melody heard over the opening credits of a very famous Universal horror movie which this is supposedly connected to..."
Abigail,2024-01-15,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> omg Angus ü•∫ the chills I got seeing him."
Abigail,2024-01-15,This looks like a lot of fun<br>Although maybe the vampire portion should‚Äôve been saved as a twist <br>But it‚Äôll be cool to see Melissa Barrera and Kathyrn Newton work together since they have horror backgrounds <br>Glad the same directors of ‚ÄòScream 6‚Äô and ‚ÄòReady or Not‚Äô are back for this <br>It looks better than ‚ÄòThe  Invitation‚Äô
Abigail,2024-01-11,My bet: Giancarlo Esposito‚Äôs character knew the girl was a vampire and got the $50m from Rich Daddy to deliver her food (ie the rest of the cast).
Abigail,2024-01-11,This Movie looks really good and fun <br>can&#39;t wait to see it and I am glad that Melissa Barrera is in this along with Kathlyn Newton
Abigail,2024-01-11,"This has the meta and dark sense of humor that Radio Silence is known for, I&#39;m all in, and it&#39;s great to see vampires making a resurgence in the modern era!"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"This looks amazing!!! although  i  cannot say that i really sympathize with the people that got themselves into that mess..They kidnapped a  girl, not knowing she is a vampire, and wanted to hold her for ransom..."
Abigail,2024-01-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=96"">1:36</a> the way she said that cracked me up üòÇ"
Abigail,2024-01-11,I&#39;m gonna check this out because it looks fun and I&#39;m a fan of many of these actors as well as the directors...but GOD it could have been awesome to experience a lot of this in the theater first rather than the trailer. I feel like I even spotted a character death in there. I wish more studios would allow for subtle trailers especially when your story has some cool surprises and red herrings.
Abigail,2024-01-15,That smile after she asks if she has kids is absolutely chilling üò∞
Abigail,2024-03-02,"I love how the movies Alisha Weir is in are so so different, and she plays so different characters"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"i was bummed about their departure from Scream. but, if this is the kind of horror flick they are making instead i‚Äôm all for it!! seems like Radio Silence are back to their roots here."
Abigail,2024-01-13,I showed this to my little sister who does ballet and told her look they&#39;re making a movie about you
Abigail,2024-01-11,R.I.P. Angus Cloud.üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Abigail,2024-01-12,"Love radio silence, love Melissa, love Kathryn. Can‚Äôt wait!"
Abigail,2024-01-11,Melissa Barrera? I‚Äôm in! She deserves the world
Abigail,2024-01-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=121"">2:01</a> This part had me laughing! ü§£"
Abigail,2024-01-15,The feel of &quot;ready or not&quot; is still very much felt in this filmüî•
Abigail,2024-01-12,"I&#39;m here for my girl Melissa Barrera! Always will! <br><br>Anyway, this looks promising + what a great ensemble of cast!!! RIP Angus, you will be dearly missedüïäÔ∏è"
Abigail,2024-01-12,I love this whole cast but Dan Stevens is always amazing when it comes to horror and thrillers. I‚Äôm excited
Abigail,2024-02-06,I find this movie trailer funny because they kidnapped the wrong girl‚Ä¶
Abigail,2024-01-12,Love when a trailer includes the entire plot thus killing my enthusiasm for watching the actual movie. Because who wants to be surprised right?
Abigail,2024-01-11,This trailer did a complete 180 U-turn and I am all for it. I will absolutely be seeing this movie
Abigail,2024-01-15,Thanks for showing almost the whole movie!
Abigail,2024-03-08,Nobody ever survives in this kind of movie ! Love to see how everyone dies üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
Abigail,2024-03-11,You had me at &quot;From the Director of Ready Or Not&quot;
Abigail,2024-04-04,The little girl&#39;s acting was amazing. üî•
Abigail,2024-02-28,This was filmed in Ireland!!! I‚Äôm so excited to see it üíöü§çüß°
Abigail,2024-02-29,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> The facial expression, the way she delivered that phrase, reminded me of Colin Farrell in Fright Night<br>So good ^^"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"This looks absolutely bad ass. Radio silence have delivered big time over the years, and I&#39;m confident this will be another crowd pleasing hit. I get the feeling there are gonna be big twists and turns throughout this story also."
Abigail,2024-01-11,Who else is gonna watch this movie for Angus Cloud üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Abigail,2024-02-18,"I hope Abigail makes it in the end. I know, she‚Äôs a blood sucking vampire. But she‚Äôs still a little girl, and has so much potential! Abigail still has more life to live!"
Abigail,2024-01-13,A ballerina vampire ü¶áüòä This is definitely an original idea. Love the cast
Abigail,2024-01-15,Thanks for giving the whole movie away! üò¨
Abigail,2024-04-16,"I love it when the trailer just tells me the whole movie, like thanks guys, I appreciate you saving me the price of the ticket."
Abigail,2024-04-08,Go Abigail! Get them all. And of course she will because she will have to return for a sequel.
Abigail,2024-01-11,Love to see Kathryn Newton getting so much. Loved her in the society &amp; in marvel. Can‚Äôt wait to see her in this &amp; very curious how her Lisa Frankenstein movie will turn out
Abigail,2024-04-06,"She is not trapped with them,they are trapped with her. :)"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"So she went from matilda to this, cant wait to see it, looks good"
Abigail,2024-01-13,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=136"">2:16</a>  what can I say I like playing with my food üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Abigail,2024-01-22,I love that the vampire genre i≈ü slowly coming back!!!<br>This movie looks greatüëèüèªüëèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
Abigail,2024-01-11,This could be best of the year in horror. I LOVE this cast and plot idea!
Abigail,2024-03-01,"Matilda when she&#39;s out of school <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=87"">1:27</a>"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsP8MFH8p0&amp;t=145"">2:25</a> Kathryn dancing should be interesting ü§î"
Abigail,2024-01-11,"The whole trailer is full of &#39;well, that just happened&#39; moments."
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"Hollywood never cast Dev as an action hero, so Dev decides to make his own action movie and star himself. Definitely marking my calendar for this thrill ride."
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,For this to be Dev Patel&#39;s directorial debut is insane. Jordan Peele was smart for taking this from Netflix to Universal. It deserves to be seen in the theaters.
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,Story by Dev Patel<br>Screenplay by Dev Patel<br>Directed by Dev Patel<br>Starring Dev Patel<br><br>Bro skipped all side missions and went straight to Boss mode<br><br>This looks brilliant
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,Whoever edited this trailer together‚Ä¶ give that person a raise
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"That chest tapping scene at the end gave me chills, can&#39;t wait to see Dev Patel in action in this amazing-looking film üôè"
Monkey Man,2024-02-29,"Dev Patel is a one-man army in this film! Story, screenplay, direction, and starring role all by him. Can&#39;t wait to see this epic adventure unfold!"
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,Props to whoever made the trailer. It was 3 minutes but it felt like 30 seconds.<br>I want to watch it right now.
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,"<b>Dev Patel grabs the Infinity Gauntlet</b><br>&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll do it myself.&quot;"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"Dev Patel has come a long way from Skins. Never knew he‚Äôd be this big, but since Slumdog Millionaire he‚Äôs grown from actor now to director and screenwriter. Good for him and he continues to impress"
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,That attempt to jump out the window was gold lol
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,"I saw the commercial today and this feels like half Hollywood and Bollywood movie! Way to go, Dev Patel &amp; Jordan Peele."
Monkey Man,2024-02-25,"This has to be one of the best edited trailer I have seen in a long time. Introduces the protagonist, antagonist, gives a gist of the story, a few snippets of action and doesn‚Äôt give away the whole plot. Brilliant. I‚Äôll be watching this film."
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,Dev Patel&#39;s evolution is definitely recognizable.
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,That attempt to jump out the window was gold lolüòÇ
Monkey Man,2024-02-03,This is his directorial DEBUT? The man is coming in STRONG.
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,Whoever did the FX on this... Give that person a raise
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"Is it a comedy, action, thriller, drama?<br><br>Director: Yes."
Monkey Man,2024-02-19,"I love how Dev Patel is pretty much doing everything. Bro wrote the story, the script, and directed as well."
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,Dev Patel finally getting the mainstream appraisal and support that he deserves.
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,"&quot;Slumdog Killionaire doesn&#39;t exist, he can&#39;t hurt you&quot;<br><br>Slumdog Killionaire:"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"I hope this movie does well, Dev Patel is such an underrated actor, and this seems like it has a great story and has stunning visuals."
Monkey Man,2024-01-31,"Dev Patel returns. And also, please raise the pay for the guys that did special effects and the editing of the trailer"
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,Whoever edited the Panjabi MC soundtrack of Mundeyan toh Bachke rahin to this trailer deserves a raise. Its so well timed
Monkey Man,2024-03-21,"If trailers had an Oscar category, this would win without even voting. <br>This should be taught in cinematography schools. Epic!!!"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,First time Dev is directing a major motion picture.<br><br>If he‚Äôs half as talented a director as he is an actor this will be legendary üî•
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,That window jump attempt made me go &quot;Fuck it! I&#39;m getting the tickets!&quot;
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,"Dev Patel be like: hold my beer, I will show you my creativity"
Monkey Man,2024-02-14,"The fact that those little action scenes we saw didn‚Äôt have the stupid, and typical quick cuts that Hollywood has already gets me excited to watch this."
Monkey Man,2024-02-08,I didn&#39;t knew Dev Patel could do action stuff. Very versatile actor.
Monkey Man,2024-03-13,This is one of the coolest looking trailers I‚Äôve seen in a while
Monkey Man,2024-01-28,Standing ovation!!! I always loved the story how Dev Patel absentmindedly went to the open casting call with a friend for skins &amp; ended up being a main feature role. Upgraded to Slum Dog Millionaire &amp; enjoyed nominations galore of praise. For his first directing debut he slams down this beauty of brilliant culturally rich story telling with scriptwriting &amp; starring. Jordan Peele doesn‚Äôt endorse unless it‚Äôs worthy to his own offerings. Well done!!
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"Never in my dreams, I&#39;ve imagined Dev Patel as an action star much less an action director. He&#39;s broken the shackles or stereotypical portrayal and can&#39;t wait to watch this one."
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"Good for Dev man. I love to see actors making their directorial debuts. If Hollywood won&#39;t give it to you, make it yourself. This will be a day 1 watch"
Monkey Man,2024-02-02,"See? It‚Äôs possible to make an amazing trailer, without spoiling the movie, with great music, and stellar editing. This should honestly make history, trailers have truly been lacking as of late, this surely raises the bar."
Monkey Man,2024-02-01,"WOAH. Story, screenplay, directed, AND starring Dev Patel?!<br>If this young man wasn&#39;t going places before, he sure as shit will now."
Monkey Man,2024-02-29,Trailers need an oscar category.
Monkey Man,2024-03-30,"I&#39;m so glad Dev Patel put this labor of love together. Finally, Patel gets to be the center of attraction in an action movie. If Hollywood&#39;s too stupid or biased to see what we need, then it&#39;s up to the actors to create their own script. Can&#39;t wait for this."
Monkey Man,2024-01-31,Dude.. bloody phenomenal.. give that guy who made the audio mix a raise.. and a bloody award... can&#39;t wait..
Monkey Man,2024-01-31,"John Wick : India, i didn&#39;t know Jordan Peele &amp; Dev Patel can make masterpiece action-pack movie like this"
Monkey Man,2024-01-31,"I cannot believe what I just saw.<br><br>Jordan Peele and Dev Patel, never thought. Insane trailer and the BG score just makes it perfect."
Monkey Man,2024-02-28,The fact that they made a film based Around the Hindu lore of Hanuman the protector of the people this shit is going to go crazy Dev Patel is not playing around
Monkey Man,2024-02-02,The line &quot;A small ember can burn down everything&quot; is a reference from the Great Ramayana where Lord Hanuman burned down a whole city. Kudos to the writers of this movie.
Monkey Man,2024-02-11,"Disney, you&#39;re f%cked. This 3 minute trailer had me more hooked than you have in over 3 years..."
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,Whoever did the remix of the song.... GIVE THAT PERSON A RAISE IMMEDITELY
Monkey Man,2024-02-03,"from the Dev Patel of the Slum dog Millionaire to Directory, Story and actor. You have came a long way. This is called growth and heres wishing you all the success."
Monkey Man,2024-02-02,Looks really good. Big kudos to Dev Patel for bringing an Indian folk hero to the screen in a contemporary way for international audiences.
Monkey Man,2024-02-12,I‚Äôm happy Jordan pushed to  give this a theatre release instead of streaming platforms. Bring back good cinema!
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"That kitchen fight scene is so well coregraphed , it literally gave me chills ü•∂"
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"The beating of his chest syncing with/transitioning into the title gave me chills, this trailer is amazing."
Monkey Man,2024-03-16,Finally an original movie in a sea of sequels and reboots that actually looks good
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,Hanuman Wick.  <br>Looks awesome!
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"man , who the hell is DOP for this movie. he fucking nailed the every scene. Finally Dev Patel comes with one more epic tale."
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"Dev Patel said he never wanted to play James Bond, because he was doing something BETTER."
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,How could you NOT love the multiverse? This new &quot;John Patel&quot; movie is going to be fire!
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,Jordan Peele producing with Dev Patel directing makes this so much cooler. This makes me so happy.
Monkey Man,2024-01-30,"The trailer is so well made, the music matches the editing perfectly. Haven&#39;t been excited for a movie in a long time. Love the comic timing."
Monkey Man,2024-02-23,Dev Patel &amp; Jordan Peele‚Ä¶.I have goose bumps ü§ûü§û
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,"Have been a huge fan of Dev Patel since ‚ÄúLion‚Äù where he delivered an extraordinary performance. Seems like he has outdone himself again. What an amazing trailer, just giving literal chills. Can‚Äôt wait to see this upcoming masterpiece. Love you Dev‚ù§‚ù§"
Monkey Man,2024-02-28,Finally a big budget Indian led and directed hollywood action movie.
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,The transition from the flying kick to the rickshaw drifting üî•üî•üî•
Monkey Man,2024-02-03,"Everyone is talking about editing, audio  etc. I&#39;m just happy to see that there&#39;s another movie set in India. So much culture and potential for great movies to be made. Dev is awesome"
Monkey Man,2024-01-28,"The intensity of Bollywood, the  visual of americans, the drama of europe, the weird comedy of J. Peele, and Patel being angry Patel... Great mix!"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,Indian johnwick vibe...üí£üí•üî•
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"It actually does look pretty decent. Cool set pieces, fun fight sequences. Also I like that it&#39;s not John Wick, Equalizer and Tom Cruise cause they&#39;ve literally been carrying the action genre on their back for like a decade lol."
Monkey Man,2024-03-16,man..dev patel went all in..hats off ..from film making to acting and kudos to the level of hardship and the commitment he has put his body through...Will be a next level theatre experience..
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,&quot;Dev Patel&#39;s directorial debut&quot; stop right there. You&#39;ve sold me. Inject this film into my veins now!
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,Love the way he integrated Hanumans story
Monkey Man,2024-01-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8zxiB5Qhsc&amp;t=186"">3:06</a> That visual and music sync üî•"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"Dev Patel. A beast. Literally and metaphorically. Never thought, a shy gujju guy can pull this off. When they don&#39;t cast you in a badass action movie, you just cast yourself in one and prove everyone wrong. Must watch!!"
Monkey Man,2024-01-28,This is What happens When the Director gets Full freedom on creativity. <br>Stunning....
Monkey Man,2024-01-28,"When no one wants to hire you, you hire yourself!<br>Good job Mr Patel"
Monkey Man,2024-01-29,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8zxiB5Qhsc&amp;t=75"">1:15</a> I laughed when this music popped upüòÇ"
Monkey Man,2024-01-26,"I remember when Dev was doing press for Slumdog, and he talked about how he&#39;d love to do an action movie, as he has done martial arts since he was a kid.<br>Im so happy that this is what manifested üòÅ"
Monkey Man,2024-01-28,This came out of nowhere. This actor can really direct and perform action choreography really well.
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,"If you want to know the story of Arthur, here it is: it was a stray dog (as many of my country Ecuador) who tailed a Swedish team on their journey during the Huairasinchi World Adventure Racing Championship Ecuador. It was a true tough cookie. Also if you want to discover the wonders of my country and take a stray pup with you, you&#39;ll receive garanteed eternal happines for visiting us and taking some love back home. üòâ"
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,I had the pleasure of chatting with Mikael Lindnord and this story is so phenomenal. Speaking with him and hearing him speak about his time with Arthur gave me chills.
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,I had the fortune to met Arthur three times I think it was...an amazing dog and an amazing story
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,"I remember watching a documentary that mentioned this story. It&#39;s so incredible and inspiring. One of those tales where the journey isn&#39;t entirely about the destination, but the friends you meet along the way. In this case, it&#39;s the furry friends you meet along the wayüêæüê∂"
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,Arthur is from Ecuador üá™üá® and we‚Äôre going to remember him!
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,So stoked for a movie about our incredible sport of adventure racing!! I raced in the World Championships the year after Arthur and everyone was still talking about him ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
Arthur the King,2023-11-20,As I lay on my bed snuggled with my dog just watching the trailer is making me cry we really don‚Äôt deserve dogs. They go through hell on earth in some cases and still want to connect with a human being it‚Äôs astounding ‚ù§ I will definitely be watching this
Arthur the King,2023-11-17,"Mikael lindnord wrote the book, Arthur about Arthur. Worth the read‚ù§ and makes the movie so much more special."
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,I cried just watching the trailer ‚ù§ dogs are family
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,"So sad they say in the movie it happened in the Dominican Republic,  because it did not. It happened in ECUADOR"
Arthur the King,2024-02-24,I cried so much üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢watching Arthur documentary and now I come here.  ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§you so much Arthur!!! May you RIP sweet angel !!!
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,"Para los que no sabemos la historia de Arthur, este trailer es muy emotivo. Tantos perritos de la calle y tan pocos corazones capaces de brindarles ayuda. Ansiosa de ver la pel√≠cula por todos los Arthurs del planeta ü§çüôè"
Arthur the King,2023-11-26,Just the trailer literally brought tears to me.
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,"Arthur an ecuadorian hero, congrats and thank you‚ù§"
Arthur the King,2023-11-18,"I am amazed by the story of this little dog ...what a hero, but I am also excited that in the comments Ecuador is mentioned, we could have treated this buddy better but that didn&#39;t happen as most things in life, his story is a reminder to take care of the ones out there and live as they do with passion and happiness despite hardships"
Arthur the King,2023-11-17,Cannot wait to watch!!ü§© I can add Arthur to my list of reasons why Dogs are really ANGELS!üòç

Arthur the King,2023-12-14,I followed that story in real time. Arthur&#39;s story makes me tear up every single time.
Arthur the King,2024-03-05,Great that people will know the story of Arthur.. this true story happened in Ecuador.. we have many dogs that need to be adopted..
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,Finally!!!! Can&#39;t wait to watch this with our full AR community from India. It was wonderful meeting Mikael in person and hearing his story.
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,"Really looking forward to seeing this! The book was fantastic, and we&#39;re excited to see it on the big screen."
Arthur the King,2023-12-08,"I&#39;m already so sure this is gonna make me bawl. I&#39;m very picky with movies about dogs because I don&#39;t wanna get my heartbroken,but this one I&#39;ll watch"
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,"Arthur el perrito ecuatoriano protagonista de una linda aventura su historia ser√° plasmada en una pelicula, con ansias de ya verla... ECUADOR"
Arthur the King,2023-11-15,Ese perrito fue llevado de ecuador por unos extranjeros linda historia de amor puro que nos demuestran las mascotas
Arthur the King,2024-02-16,The story happened on the &quot;Huairasinchi&quot; Adventure Race of 2014 in Ecuador :)
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,An Adventure Racing movie is going to be awesome!! Can&#39;t wait to watch it
Arthur the King,2023-11-16,No puedo creer que cambiaron la localizaci√≥n de la historia de Ecuador a la Rep√∫blica Dominicana.
Arthur the King,2023-12-14,Man this is gonna be a tear jerker. Look forward to seeing this‚ù§
Arthur the King,2023-11-17,"Lo que la productora ahorro o recibio por cambiar la locaci√≥n de los hechos (cambiar Ecuador por Rep√∫blica Dominicana) lo pierde en el marketing que los ecuatorianos hubieran hecho en redes promocionando esta pelicula, ahora ni a los cines querr√°n ir a verla y la esperaran en streaming. Athur era un h√©roe ecuatoriano."

Blink Twice,2024-04-29,"The fact that Zoe kravitz is directing this and co wrote it, she must have seen/heard things growing up in the industry, I‚Äôm looking forward to this!"
Blink Twice,2024-07-28,"Blink twice if im in danger. The dude immediately hard blinks twice at her. She laughs it off. That&#39;s the real world for you. You can try to tell people you can yell and scream it, but people won&#39;t listen. They have to see it for themselves"
Blink Twice,2024-04-23,Interesting for Channing to branch out in this genre. Sometimes actors stay too long in their genre that you can&#39;t see them in anything else. Channing is mainly known for comedy/adventure. But this does seem to fit him.

Blink Twice,2024-07-28,"Actors turned directors are always good at making horror films. All they have to do is give the viewers a glimpse of what goes down with the rich and elites. Hide it in plain sight. On another note, I can&#39;t wait to watch this üòÆ"

Kraven the Hunter,2024-08-14,"So Kraven, Chameleon, and Rhino are in the same movie with no Spider-Man. So are these just dimensions of what the villains would turn out if there is no Peter Parker"
Kraven the Hunter,2024-08-15,Whoever thought of casting Russel and Aaron as Father-Son should be given a raise!!!<br>There is a resemblance
Kraven the Hunter,2024-08-15,"Imagine if Marvel made an Iron Monger movie without Iron Man, a Red Skull movie without Captain America, an Abomination movie without the Hulk, a Baron Zemo movie without an Avengers team to split apart.

Kraven the Hunter,2024-09-30,"I am loving Kraven&#39;s intensity. I just hope they keep the fact he is a trained hunter. You can be a proud hunter and have respect for the animal kingdom all the same. Sure, its alittle morally grey but that is Kraven. In the comics he has tended to and protected a animal. In fact he&#39;s utterly horrified seeing a hornless rhino nearlly killed by poachers.<br><br>All in all while he respects animals and loves them in a twisted way, he still wants to be the apex predator in both food chains so i hope they can find that balance."

The Bikeriders,2024-03-01,Hardy‚Äôs screen presence is unmatched. Makes the absolute best in the game look like secondary characters.
The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,"This cast is stacked, can&#39;t wait for this movie to finally be released!"
The Bikeriders,2024-03-27,We&#39;re getting so much of Austin this year and I love it
The Bikeriders,2024-04-11,The golden era of Bikers is making a serious comeback! And I will just say it‚Ä¶.this country needs it right now!
The Bikeriders,2024-03-03,"I mean, Austin butler&#39;s talent is glowing in everything he does. And Tom Hardy? I&#39;m sold."

The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,"Hardy, Butler, Shannon, Reedus......nice üòç"
The Bikeriders,2024-03-01,The route that Austin is taking since Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is superbly traced and it gives so much more meaning to his career to see him in a biker film like this which suits him well. With Elvis he was on the verge of winning the Oscar but there will be no doubt that he will win the Oscar either with The Bikeriders as best leading role or with Dune 2 as best supporting role.
The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,"Hardy is finally back doing serious roles,excited for this movie."
The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,Looking forward to it. Jeff Nicols is a really good director and Austin Butler......what can I say.......I&#39;d see anything he is in as well as Tom Hardy. Going to see Dune 2 tomorrow where I hear Austin Butler is brilliant.

The Bikeriders,2024-03-02,Dare I say Austin Butler is our generation&#39;s James Dean.  Did I spy Norman Reedus here too!? Hell yeah. Ride on.
The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,"Since Cillian got nominated and may win an Oscar, I now really wish Tom to get his long dued Oscar possibly for Best Supporting Actor....<br><br>He was terrific in The Revenant tooo...."

The Bikeriders,2024-03-01,"That is a hard ass line ‚Äúsome people would rather crash, than slow down‚Äù"
The Bikeriders,2024-02-29,Austin Butler definitely grew on me. He is amazing on<br> ‚ÄúMasters of Air‚Äù
The Bikeriders,2024-06-18,Saw it last night. Terrific film with compelling stories from major and minor roles. Gritty and rough and one of the best film I‚Äôve seen this year.

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-01-31,You had me at &quot;Guy Ritchie&quot; and freaking kept me there with that innnnnnnsane cast ensemble. üòÇ

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-01-30,"This looks like the most fun Cavill has had on a film in a long time. Guy Ritchie is always a win in my eyes, and immediately makes anything watchable as long as he&#39;s directing it. Here&#39;s to hoping for a good box office success with this one - it&#39;s long past well deserved!"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-01-30,The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was one my favourite movies of all time. Absolutely love the vibes this trailer is giving off.

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-01-30,Guy Ritchies&#39; Inglorious Basterds with Cavill playing a lunatic? YES PLEASE!
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-02-21,Cavill looks like he had a blast making this. And Alan&#39;s comedic Thad Castle mixed with Reachers badassery fits perfectly. Everyone seems like they loved making this and the trailer is awesome.

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-01-30,Good to see Alan Ritchson getting more roles as of late. Dude is immensely talented both as a comedic and dramatic actor. For reference go watch him in Reacher and then watch him in Blue Mountain State. Those roles couldn‚Äôt be more different

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024-04-14,I was already on board with the director and cast .. but the fact they cut the trailer so everything happens to the beat of the song ... I&#39;m sold

Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-19,"There are so many excellent actors  out there today,  but Scarlett is a genuine  Movie Star. If she&#39;s in it I go see it."
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-07-09,"This looks fun! Also, happy Scarlett is getting some top billing after her stint at Marvel. She‚Äôs wonderful."
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-08,That‚Äôs one small dean for dean one giant dean for deankind.
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-09,For anybody wondering what the song towards the end was its &quot;eddie floyd - big bird&quot;
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-07-11,Such a creative story line - loved this movie ... great casting. Definitely a must-see!
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-17,They are just trolling at this point now lol.
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-07-11,"Fly Me to the Moon is unlike any movie I‚Äôve seen before. This film is well directed, with moments of slow burn and action, and has a strong backstory. It pays homage to a very memorable historical event whilst being heart-warming and suspenseful. Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!üòä"
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-11,"This is a very well-done trailer! It will bring back the old discussion about humans going to the moon. The fact that we have not been able to go back 50 years after the first landing with all the technology that we have now is confronting. NASA lost crucial information as well as the original film of the landing: this is also embarrassing. I still want to believe it was real, though, but it becomes harder as time goes by."
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-16,Scarlett and Channing‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-23,I brought a deli tray to the set for this movie. Cant wait to see it!
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-07-11,I was an extra in this.. awesome project to be on!! Crazy to see myself in the trailer. Cant wait to watch it this weekend!!!!
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-04-10,Next year they&#39;ll release &quot;fly me back to the moon&quot;. Supposed to take place in 2025&#39;s. And still a vaporproject.
Fly Me to the Moon,2024-06-18,I liked this movie when it was called Capricorn One.
Unsung Hero,2024-04-04,"I laugh every time I hear Lucas Black say, &quot;I wish I had an accent.&quot;"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,"Saw it last night in an early release special , I‚Äôm a guy that doesn‚Äôt cry that much it had me tearing up 3 or 4 different times an amazing story"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-03,"Can&#39;t wait for this movie. We&#39;ve been lacking heartfelt, family stories that teach us good and valuable life lessons from mainstream Hollywood for years now. Kingdom Story in general have made great movies, especially Ordinary Angels which I absolutely loved. Looking forward to seeing this!"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,I just went to go see this and let me tell you probably one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen this year very peaceful relaxing movie I highly recommend yall see this üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,I saw the preview last night. Very inspirational! I was truly moved to see what the power of God can do when we move out of the way and let him fight our battles!
Unsung Hero,2024-04-12,Looking Forward to seeing this! The Trailer looks Great!
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,The world needs more movies like this..
Unsung Hero,2024-04-04,Looking forward to this  movie
Unsung Hero,2024-04-03,much better than the first trailer
Unsung Hero,2024-04-19,"Their story and testimony are uplifting and encouraging.  God has blessed them and annointed their music, words and story for ALL !!  The first weekend is vital in theatres for the movie to stay on the big screen and hopefully more lost souls will see it !!  Please go and invite others too !"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,"This was SO GOOD!!! I really want to share this on Facebook, but there&#39;s no POST button when I&#39;m on Facebook! Sometimes, I really, really don&#39;t like social media!"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-10,Please release in India too.
Unsung Hero,2024-04-03,Amazing.
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,Much better trailer than the first one. Love it.
Unsung Hero,2024-04-16,"Just purchased my tickets, excited to see this film"
Unsung Hero,2024-04-17,Can‚Äôt wait to see it!  Lionsgate puts out some of the best movies.
Unsung Hero,2024-04-09,"By watching the trailer, I felt somewhat unclear on what the story was about. I had to read the description for clarification."
Unsung Hero,2024-04-10,Can‚Äôt wait!!!!
Unsung Hero,2024-04-22,Is this about Rebecca St James?
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,Just saw this awesome very uplifting you can totally see how God works during this
Unsung Hero,2024-04-25,Just watched it and it‚Äôs Sooo good! üòä‚ù§
The First Omen,2024-03-14,"&quot;How do you control people who no longer believe? You create something to fear.&quot; That&#39;s a powerful line <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc""></a>"
The First Omen,2024-03-12,Ralph Ineson&#39;s voice is a character in itself.
The First Omen,2024-03-23,Ralph Ineson voice is so freaking iconic.
The First Omen,2024-03-13,"I&#39;ve missed seeing Nell Tiger Free since Servant ended. Since it was an Apple TV show, probably not many people know who she is. They&#39;re in for a treat!"
The First Omen,2024-04-01,I clicked on the trailer already. I don&#39;t need a 6-second countdown before it begins.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"The omen is such a cool premise that has been completely under-utilised ever since the first movie. If they could do this story right; birth, ascent, battle. It would be a literal god tier trilogy."
The First Omen,2024-03-15,"As someone who has grown a huge appreciation and love for the Omen films recently, this is quite exciting!"
The First Omen,2024-03-11,Damien&#39;s mother is a literal Jackal.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,First trailer was iconic with the reversed footage tenet style
The First Omen,2024-03-11,So how does this explain Damien&#39;s mother being a jackal in the original 1976 film?
The First Omen,2024-03-17,Love the voice of this actor. He played the father in &quot;VVitch&quot;.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"Nell Tiger Free was amazing in Servant, so I can&#39;t wait to see how she does in this"
The First Omen,2024-03-12,Cracks me up that every horror franchise eventually goes ‚Äúhey you know how all that scary stuff happened in the first movie? What if we set the next movie before all the scary stuff happens?? This is a great idea!‚Äù
The First Omen,2024-03-18,The sound effects of this trailer are incredible
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"Working title was The Jackal, so we‚Äôre getting the Jackal. So calm down, y‚Äôall, this looks good"
The First Omen,2024-03-11,All we want is Alien Romulus trailer
The First Omen,2024-03-14,the &#39;&#39;it&#39;s all for you&#39;&#39; reference from the very first omen sent meeeeeee
The First Omen,2024-04-03,"saw it today,there is one scene I think they did a tribute to Possession 1981‚ù§"
The First Omen,2024-03-11,I wonder if the thing she gives birth to in this film isn&#39;t Damien himself but a hellhound-like jackal creature that becomes the mother of Damien?
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"Perhaps they&#39;re taking the approach that the young girl, Carlita, was a failed attempt to birth Damien? This would set-up a potential &quot;happy&quot; ending, where Nell Tiger Free&#39;s character can save the girl and everything looks to end well. At this point, you can bring in the jackal plot point and not stray too far from canon. Or the &quot;this girl is meant to be a mother&quot; element is a red herring. I mean, I can&#39;t imagine they would just drop one of the most important (and disturbing) elements of the previous books/movies."
The First Omen,2024-03-11,I thought Damien was born from a jackal in the original books and films.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"April 5th, right after Easter!! Nice touch üî• üî•"
The First Omen,2024-03-26,"At the end, when she saying it‚Äôs not real, it‚Äôs not real , and the thing goes what‚Äôs not real . That truly made me laugh out loud. ü§£ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I love a good jump scare move üëçüèæ"
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"Dude, where&#39;s my jackal???"
The First Omen,2024-03-23,Where&#39;s John  Constantine and Chuck Norris when you really need them
The First Omen,2024-03-12,&quot;Chris Finch...bloody good rep&quot;.
The First Omen,2024-03-13,"I love the original 1976 film with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. It had the right combination of camp and horror. I&#39;ll keep an open mind about this film, and the casting of Ralph Ineson as Father Brennan is an inspired choice."
The First Omen,2024-03-13,After the Exorcist Believer. I will wait for the reviews to come out.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,"Wow. I wasn&#39;t expecting much,but i did laugh out loud and groan when they did the whole &quot;this is for you&quot; bit. When will these studios do anything original?"
The First Omen,2024-03-12,I just want a season 2 of Damien. Please.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,Some parts of this trailer look amazing other parts Hollywood producer cliche meddling
The First Omen,2024-03-15,Thr real history of the church and the children they kidnapped is more terrifying then a horror movie.
The First Omen,2024-03-13,‚ÄúHis mother was a jackal!‚Äù. Where it at though?
The First Omen,2024-03-17,Nell Tiger Free is incredible. She was so good in The Servant.
The First Omen,2024-03-11,Wasn&#39;t Damien&#39;s mother a jackal?
The First Omen,2024-03-11,Has anyone mentioned that Damien&#39;s mother was a jackal yet?
The First Omen,2024-03-12,Now this is definitely more creepier and intense especially This trailer gives me a lot of optimism that we might be in for a real gem the cast looks really good. It feels that the protagonist of the film nell tiger free may not be at the full front of the movie which I thought she might be instead it‚Äôs a little girl but throughout the trailer it‚Äôs shows they maybe twists and turns. Overall the trailer looks good and intensely interesting
The First Omen,2024-03-12,Released on my birthday; I can&#39;t wait!üòç
The First Omen,2024-03-12,This looks really wicked. So far visually promising
The First Omen,2024-03-13,"Hopefully they keep his mum being a Jackal, that was a really cool addition to the story that has been consistant"
The First Omen,2024-04-04,It premieres in Japan tomorrow! I have high expectations because it‚Äôs a series I love üëè I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how it connects with the first installment!
The First Omen,2024-03-12,"Okay, this looks great; all the fresh faces, all the suspense."
The First Omen,2024-04-04,I‚Äôm more hooked to the Ralph Ineson‚Äôs voice than the trailer itself haha
The First Omen,2024-03-11,They better play &quot;You&#39;re The Devil&#39;s Son&quot; at some point during the movie
The First Omen,2024-03-11,I&#39;m looking forward to see this movie. I am genuinely intrigued to watch after the premiere date.
The First Omen,2024-03-12,I‚Äôm sorry but I am a 6o‚Äôs baby and nothing can duplicate the original 1st and 2nd movie. The 3rd was ok but the 4th and 5th they could have kept. The remake with Julia was ok because they sorta kept to the script. I‚Äôve read the comments and I agree- looking for the jackal and the mark of the beast is a son. The scene when she died for Damien was classic- this scene did nothing for me. I will only watch it if it is free on one of the streaming channels.
The First Omen,2024-03-12,"Oh, so that&#39;s why Disney made a prequel to The Omen."
The First Omen,2024-03-11,I Think This Needs Some Jerry Goldsmith Music For This Trailer...!
The First Omen,2024-04-03,There&#39;s nothing like the original. Nothing. Never was and never will.
The First Omen,2024-04-01,I&#39;m grateful that they didn&#39;t use a black person
The First Omen,2024-03-11,Ever notice how they use the exact same sound FX and &quot;music&quot; for every single trailer these days? Every. Single. Trailer.
The First Omen,2024-03-16,I wanna see this üò´üò´üò´
Cabrini,2024-03-03,"As a graduate of Cabrini High School, 1991,(where she built her orphanage)I am so thrilled to see this woman given a major motion picture. üíô"
Cabrini,2024-03-02,"I worked for nearly 4 years at a children&#39;s shelter named &#39;Cabrini,&#39; having no idea of the origin of its name. I feel honored now, knowing who it was named after, and that the work we did there honored Cabrini&#39;s legacy. Definitely want to see this movie!"
Cabrini,2024-03-06,"Having Italian immigrant grandparents, being from NYC, and being born at  Mother Cabrini Hospital, I&#39;ve been aware of this magnificent woman all my life."
Cabrini,2024-03-01,It&#39;s such a crime that I&#39;ve never heard of Mother Cabrini before. She seems to have been an incredible woman and I can&#39;t wait to see this with my fianc√©e when it comes out. He can&#39;t wait either and neither of us are even Catholic.
Cabrini,2024-03-01,With the hand of God beats the heart of this Saint. What    an incredible story.
Cabrini,2024-03-04,Much more than a masterpiece!!! Should be screened across the globe in all languages. Please PLEASE bring it to Lebanon üôèüôè
Cabrini,2024-03-07,"My first nursing job was at Cabrini Hospital in Chicago.  I went down to the chapel every day with my mentor, Sr. Alfonsina; and Mother Cabrini&#39;s humerus is ensconced in gold right in the alter.  Unbelievable."
Cabrini,2024-03-02,"Angel Studios is proving there‚Äôs much more to it than The Chosen. I look forward to this very promising film about a very real saint who performed very real miracles. And like all saints, keeps on interceding on our behalf. That, in itself, is a very real miracle."
Cabrini,2024-03-03,Congrats Angel Studios and thank you for being part of this kind of movies. Sound of freedom let us know about you and you are amazing. What for some is trash is a treasure to others. Can‚Äôt wait to watch Cabrini.
Cabrini,2024-03-01,"She makes me so proud to be an Italian, Thank you Mother Cabrini ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
Cabrini,2024-03-05,"I have always wanted to adopt, and the time planned is nearing. ‚ô•Ô∏è Prayers from the faithful for children in need and the process to be blessed are appreciated!"
Cabrini,2024-03-06,I chose her as my patron saint for my confirmation 32 years ago!  I always loved that she came to America and is buried here
Cabrini,2024-03-07,"St. Frances Cabrini, pray for our children who need to be loved."
Cabrini,2024-03-01,This movie is such an eye opener!
Cabrini,2024-03-02,"Father Mulligan (later Monsignor Mulligan) spoke about Mother Cabrini in his homily rotation, regularly in the 70&#39;s.  His knowledge of history and his gift to tell a story with color, calmness and clarity belied his intent...to draw the listener in, open the heart and allow empathy and compassion to flow (a trifecta of the Trinity).  I am really pleased to see a film made to share the story with a wider audience."
Cabrini,2024-03-01,"Wow angel studios, can&#39;t wait for bonhoeffer, homestead and sight am gona put my full support on the projects."
Cabrini,2024-03-01,This trailer alone is &#39;Oscar -worthy&#39;!
Cabrini,2024-03-02,This director is growing exponentially. Got that artsy touch.
Cabrini,2024-03-01,Cabrini is the best movie of 2024.
Cabrini,2024-03-01,"Wow,, my mother gave birth in a hospital in Chicago named after this amazing woman"
Cabrini,2024-03-01,"Wow. Indeed, a true masterpiece. &quot;Our nets will be His story.&quot;  -inspired from the film Testament: The Parables Retold&quot; Angel Studios! üôåüèºüåü"
Cabrini,2024-03-07,We all have been (WOKE) with fake love at some point of our life. This is perfect for anyone with dilutional love to see what real love costs and requires.<br>Perfect gift for the young.
Cabrini,2024-03-06,"Would you believe John Candy was my introduction to this great woman!<br>Believe it or not, UNCLE BUCK was the film.The scene where he stops the drunk clown from entering the house. The rude fellow responds: WHAT ARE YOU, MOTHER CABRINI?‚ù§"
Cabrini,2024-03-03,"How can I never have heard of her?!  I can&#39;t wait to see this.  Angel Studios you are doing such great work, and I am so happy to see the great response you are getting to your movies."
Cabrini,2024-03-01,Hope this gets Angel Studios to have a high rating finally and gets Oscar nominated next year. And that it finally gives high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. <br><br>By the way did anyone get this trailer at AMC?
Cabrini,2024-03-01,"Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini, pray for us!"

American Fiction,2023-10-17,"&quot;The dumber I behave, the richer I get.&quot;  A statement for our times."
American Fiction,2023-10-18,"This looks like a must watch. As a black man, I‚Äôm always critical of the parts of our culture that glorify the lowest common denominator. This movie looks poised to shine an entertaining light on that cultural shortcoming."
American Fiction,2023-10-20,"This is SO real. I remember when I started writing as a journalist, everybody kept telling me, &quot;I know it hurts, but you have to dumb it down so people can understand.&quot; How I felt it: &quot;Your writing sucks. It&#39;s unintelligible, and you should change careers.&quot; That lasted until I started writing as if I were talking to a funny friend who only wanted to know what happened. Things improved, but it still hurts."
American Fiction,2024-01-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0MbLCpYJPA&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> The fact that a white woman is the first one to stand up and clap is the most accurate thing ever."
American Fiction,2023-12-18,This is what I want from black cinema!! It‚Äôs a satirical take on how the usage of ‚Äúblack culture‚Äù sells and can get you famous but it‚Äôs not advantageous for artists who see how they must act a certain way to be successful in the industries they‚Äôre in. Congrats to Cord Jefferson and this flawless cast! üôèüèæ
American Fiction,2023-11-12,"I think it&#39;s great that a movie is tackling the bigotry of low expectations. It seems the &quot;authentic black experience&quot; is always painted in the most stereotypical way, and if someone deviates from the stereotypes they are &quot;acting white&quot;."
American Fiction,2023-10-16,Remember when Bamboozled came out and people said it was one of Spike Lee&#39;s worst? That movie was ahead of its time and everyone owes him an apology.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"As a person in publishing business for years I loved the story, how it mocks popular culture and stereotyping. Also one of my favorite actors Jeffrey Wright is the lead. This is a definite must see for me."
American Fiction,2024-03-20,"The shot where the middle aged white woman in the crowd with the perfect blonde/grey bob and sanctimonious air, leaps to her feet, literally blocking out the black man... is one of the most perfect shots in cinema - no dialogue just a 2 second frame that says it all. The way people are, versus the way you need people to be to suit your own agenda."
American Fiction,2024-01-07,"As an Indigenous Artist, I&#39;m always pigeons holed into people always asking why I don&#39;t make &quot;traditional art&quot;, which is the commodification of our many and diverse cultures. I definitely want to watch this, and have been a huge fan of Wright&#39;s since I saw him in Angels in America when I was a teen. We need more stories like this. WE control the narrative."
American Fiction,2023-10-23,I love Jeffrey Wright. He‚Äôs such an amazing actor.<br><br>‚ÄúThis Juneteenth . . . December‚Äù üòÇ
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"Besides loving the cast, I have to say that I haven&#39;t laughed this much just on a trailer alone in quite some time. I&#39;m here for this one. ü§£ü§£ü§£"
American Fiction,2023-10-17,I have NEVER gone back and watched a trailer before but this was brilliant and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie.  Jeffrey Wright is a brilliant actor.
American Fiction,2024-01-07,"In 2008 I read the book this was based on, Erasure by Percival Everett. It similarly got less fanfare than it deserved despite being a great story. Cutting, devastatingly funny commentary on our culture. Can&#39;t wait to watch it &amp; so glad they made it a movie!"
American Fiction,2024-01-07,Saw this last night and LOVED IT!! The whole theatre was cracking up at the insanity of where we‚Äôre at in society that this is reality.
American Fiction,2023-11-28,Just saw this. It‚Äôs one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a long long time. So intelligent. Great comedy. Great writing. Great performances. I‚Äôm telling everyone to see it.
American Fiction,2023-10-18,Jeffrey Wright has always been phenomenal in every role I&#39;ve seen him in.  I haven&#39;t been to the theater since Blade Runner 2049 but I&#39;ll be there for this.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,Jeffrey Wright acting hood/gangsta is comedic gold. This is going to be a fun movie!
American Fiction,2023-12-16,"I saw this movie last week and it was beyond good. Amazing writing, great character development, fantastic dialogue and most of all great acting. Go see it!"
American Fiction,2024-03-12,This is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Absolutely fantastic. The truth in the humour and satire is spot on. Great cast.
American Fiction,2023-11-11,That white lady who stands up and claps can&#39;t wait to meme that lol
American Fiction,2023-10-17,I freaking love Jeffery Wright since westworld he was so good in that show I&#39;m so glad he is getting more work and hopefully an Oscar for this movie cause it looks amazing
American Fiction,2023-11-09,&quot;My Pafology&quot; killed me!ü§£
American Fiction,2024-03-26,It&#39;s really two stories. Society and their expectations. And family and their expectations.
American Fiction,2024-02-17,"I mean every single actor in this movie did a perfect job, no matter how small the role was everyone was perfect. It‚Äôs a comedy but it‚Äôs real drama, real serious acting and performances. The type of movie I can watch again and again over the years. Loved it. One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a while, iron claw too"
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"as a black poet, yep, the premise of this movie is spot on"
American Fiction,2023-10-16,"This was the best movie at Tiff, well deserved winning the people&#39;s choice award, and kind of made fun of a lot of what they program at that festival even. Excited to see it again. Saw it in a Press and Industry showing, and heard more laughs than I can remember from an audience."
American Fiction,2023-10-19,"For a long time, whenever someone would ask for a book suggestion--particularly if they were looking for something &quot;outside the box&quot; or something with substance--I would recommend &#39;Erasure&#39; by Percival Everett. I first read it over the summer of 2007 (or so), and it really stuck with me, influencing the way I think about identity, societal expectations, and privilege. I still bring it up in conversation to this day.<br><br>I cannot put into words how excited I am to see that Mr. Everett&#39;s novel has been made into a film. Jeffrey Wright looks like he&#39;s going to crush it. This. Is. Glorious."
American Fiction,2024-01-08,"&quot;The dumber I behave, the richer I get.&quot; The quintessential Black man&#39;s plight - same as it ever was..."
American Fiction,2024-07-30,Thanks to all the producers‚Äîwho look like America and reflect us back to ourselves.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"Looks fantastic, the only question is if they distribute this properly and people ACTUALLY get to watch it, instead of being dumped on a streaming service and forgotten. Nowadays, a movie&#39;s quality does not decide anymore whether people actually see it, please release this properly in theatres, it looks great."
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"This trailer is my spirit animal. It has captured my angst as a black woman so well!!! I am laughing and crying, but mostly laughing!"
American Fiction,2024-01-30,"the comment section is the affirmation of this movie and its the most META experience ever. This movie is a remake of the premise of &#39;Bamboozled&#39;, a movie made in 2000 by Spike Lee. Many of us were alive when it was made. Yet, every 25 years, this premise comes back around and &#39;ITS SO ORIGINAL AND WHAT A REVELATION!&#39;. This is the daily life of code switchers, corporate academics and minority intellectuals, and its been the story of our fathers and their fathers before. what makes this movie MOST special, is that it takes an exhausting topic, and takes the exhaustion out of it, because that&#39;s the work we have to do over and over again. In another 25 years, we&#39;ll be right back here: bewildered by a &#39;brand new story&#39;, told in yet another refreshing way, though it is age old."
American Fiction,2023-10-16,Jeffrey Wright is perfect for this. This skewers the right people.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"I don‚Äôt normally go to the theaters but I‚Äôm genuinely excited to go see this movie. The cast is incredible, the plot looks like it should be genuinely interesting with character conflict, and the humor is on point. I‚Äôm excited and that‚Äôs rare for me with the state of Hollywood recently."
American Fiction,2023-10-18,"The literary world&#39;s version of &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;. I&#39;m here for it -- love the premise, love the casting."
American Fiction,2023-12-28,I just got back from watching this movie. It was wonderful. I even got just a little teary-eyed at one point. Great job
American Fiction,2023-10-25,"This is so refreshingly original, can&#39;t wait to watch!"
American Fiction,2023-10-22,"I saw this as a Youtube ad, and it&#39;s one of the first few times in a while I didn&#39;t press &quot;Skip.&quot;"
American Fiction,2023-11-28,"Went to a secret screening of this movie last night and to say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  So funny and well written!  One of Wrights best performances, he will run you thru a gamut of emotions along the way.  At times you are intentionally made to feel uncomfortable....those moments are obvious and always sends you straight into laughter soon after.   So well done and a must watch for anyone looking for a great movie theatre experience with others."
American Fiction,2024-07-30,"Fabulous.  Just watched it.  Not only a makes-you-think commentary on our society but a simple yet real and touching plot, well acted.  As one who remembers when a movie like this could not and would not be made, it‚Äôs thrilling to see how far we‚Äôve come, even considering the last eight years."
American Fiction,2023-12-23,This movie is a FULL GIFT. If it‚Äôs playing near you DO go see it!! üôåüèæ<br>Really unique and clever script‚Ä¶ and thoroughly HILARIOUS.  SO good! üëèüèæüëèüèæüé•‚ô•Ô∏è
American Fiction,2023-10-17,Gonna see this! im glad the topic of black creatives continuing to promote harmful black stereotypes in their work is being addressedüëÄüëÄ
American Fiction,2023-10-28,OMG. This is so accurate it‚Äôs painful. I‚Äôm an author who writes about disabled characters‚Äîbut not in the expected ‚Äúgross inspirational‚Äù way. It‚Äôs a similar concept. <br>Ow. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this!
American Fiction,2023-11-28,Saw it last night. Been in the book world for 20 years. It&#39;s brilliant and the jokes are devastating. Whole cast is fantastic. Don&#39;t miss it!
American Fiction,2023-12-22,As a black man I have been waiting for this my whole life. I am so tired of ALL the movies and books and tv shows written by and directed by black people that are about nothing more than being black.
American Fiction,2024-05-06,An absolute gem of a movie. Could not stop laughing and feeling a bit sad. For black writers everywhere who struggle to get readership and acceptance for their authentic black diasporan/black African/ African writing and staying true to whichever art speaks to them in its truest form trying to elevate it. üëè Bravo.
American Fiction,2023-10-20,"As a writer I sometimes feel like I&#39;m going to have to do something like this to sell books. This might be a comedy. But, seriously, it rings true!"
American Fiction,2023-10-17,Cord Jefferson was already obviously an original thinker way back when he was working at Gawker. This looks like a well earned win for him.
American Fiction,2023-11-18,Mr. Wright has been my favorite American actor for decades. Only he could pull this off. Run Stagger Leigh!
American Fiction,2024-10-12,The white woman standing up and applauding and covering up the black man üòÇ
American Fiction,2024-03-16,The peace sign from one black to another...will forever define us. Thank you for this movie.

American Fiction,2023-11-24,This is based on the book &quot;Erasure&quot; by Percival Everett.  I&#39;ll be reading it this weekend.  I&#39;m also looking forward to this film!
American Fiction,2023-11-30,"About 10 years ago, I read &quot;Erasure&quot;, the book that the movie is based on and thought it was one of the best, most original books I had ever read!! I am a huge Percival Everett fan.  I cannot wait to see this moving.  It looks amazing"
American Fiction,2023-10-17,This looks brilliant. Its very existence hopefully implies we&#39;re around peak pandering as a society and things should get better from here right? Right???
American Fiction,2024-05-14,"Im only 1/4th through it, and ALREADY I&#39;m raving to friends &amp; family!!"
American Fiction,2024-03-04,"Watched it today. It is a must see and the trailer does not do it justice. Funny , heartbreaking, thought provoking, makes you want to talk about ALL the subplots all the way back home."
American Fiction,2023-10-17,It&#39;s like if Donald Glover wrote one of Family Guy episodes that focuses on Brian trying to be a writer. I love it.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,Jeffrey Wright is one of my favorite actors. I‚Äôm looking forward to this.
American Fiction,2023-10-19,"If you can describe this era of humanity and social media with a better line than &#39;&#39;The dumber I behave, the richer I get.&#39;&#39;, I&#39;d love to hear it."
American Fiction,2023-10-16,"Now, this seems like a clever movie!  Love the trailer!"
American Fiction,2024-05-15,Jeffrey Wright is such an underrated actor. Really excellent! Amazing in WW
American Fiction,2024-01-09,"So Ceelo green had a lyric in his song &quot;Oh my God, being a n*gga must be a good paying job, with all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss.&quot; This has been a struggle for me most of my life. Glad to see content for those of us who know better!"
American Fiction,2023-11-28,Just got out of the theater and this was amazing to see. Absolutely hilarious and definitely a must-see film for anyone that likes dark-humor and metacommentary.
American Fiction,2023-11-04,"I can&#39;t remember the last time I watched a trailer twice in a row. This looks good on so many levels, the antidote for the ignorance of our time. Is MGM back to making amazing movies again and building a new legacy? It&#39;s looking good so far."
American Fiction,2023-10-17,"This trailer came on for another video I was watching and it had me dying. I can&#39;t wait to see this, hopefully we can bring this discussion mainstream and not just in literary spaces"

American Fiction,2023-10-17,I LOVE Percival Everett &amp; LOVE Jeffrey Wright‚ù£Ô∏è This is fabulous!
American Fiction,2023-12-11,"Come on Hollywood, give Jeffrey all the awards for this. We don‚Äôt need another movie about an old white dude from 60 years ago."
American Fiction,2024-03-10,"I came across a great review of this in the Free Press. I then shared that with a wonderful black writer on Substack, Winkfield Twyman, Jr. He and his wife saw this movie and loved it, so he sent me a link to this preview! This is what audience are looking for! Give us something real, and stop feeding us the same old garbage."
American Fiction,2023-10-17,One of the first movies in a long time I want to see the day it comes out!
American Fiction,2023-10-20,I am absolutely going to watch this! I am among the many readers feeling exactly this way about the books being published in the last decade.
American Fiction,2023-11-28,Just got out of the theater to see this in advance.  It was a surprise film at the theater but it definitely was a crowd pleaser and Jeffrey Wright is stellar in it!  It&#39;s packed with humor and social commentary. 7/10
American Fiction,2023-12-30,Loved this film ‚Äî there‚Äôs far more to it than the trailer indicates. It‚Äôs like a mix of Sideways and the code switching humor and social commentary of Key and Peele.
American Fiction,2024-03-25,"watched this movie last night. I highly, highly recommend watching this movie."
American Fiction,2023-10-17,Jeffrey Wright is an American treasure.
American Fiction,2023-10-16,In the beginning I thought üóë then I laughed üòÇ

American Fiction,2023-10-18,I&#39;m laughing really loud right now. This is genius! Watching this trailer multiple times.
American Fiction,2023-10-16,"The book this is based on is insane, can&#39;t wait for this."
American Fiction,2023-10-21,Love Jeffrey Wright. I have not seen him play a bad role or do a bad movie. Glad to see him centre stage. His time has come.
American Fiction,2024-12-08,Winning an Oscar for your directorial debut. Glorious.
American Fiction,2024-02-12,"My wife and I saw American Fiction earlier today. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years, with the best scripts I&#39;ve seen in years and some of the best acting I&#39;ve seen in years; the best musical scores I&#39;ve heard EVER, and the closing music is EXCELLENT. I give this movie 99.9 out of 100."
American Fiction,2023-10-19,Really liked it. It was a bit too long for my liking but has more than enough witty humor and wholesome interactions to keep the story going. It develops <b>most</b> characters pretty well and has enough depth to chew leading up to a pretty cool ending.
American Fiction,2023-10-18,"For those that can&#39;t wait-- The movie is based on the novel &quot;Erasure&quot; by Percival Everett, which is also a great time."
American Fiction,2023-10-16,‚ÄúYou said that‚Ä¶.not me‚Äù
American Fiction,2024-02-23,"I just watched this movie in a packed theatre! 5/5 for hitting all the feels and emotions. The story itself is phenomenal and I‚Äôm white but all of these hidden themes hit so hard.<br><br>This is classic! I believe the movie is ‚Äúthe movie within the movie‚Äù no spoilers, watch it you‚Äôll understand."
American Fiction,2023-12-14,Jeffrey Wright and Paul Giamatti are going to battle it out for the Oscar. And I have no problem at all about that. Two phenomenal actors.
American Fiction,2023-10-17,This movie is an adaptation of the 2001 novel Erasure by Percival Everett. Great novel. Check it out if you can.
American Fiction,2023-10-29,"Looks like an exceptional social critique that takes personal responsibility as well, thus being a community&#39;s self-critique. Not common for that latter reason. This looks genuinely amazing."
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-22,A story of stangers helping each other out is something we can all appreciate and strive to do more of in our own lives and communities. Looks like a tear jerker
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-02,"Wow, who else had goosebumps? This looks like such a beautifully moving story. Can&#39;t wait to see Hillary Swank in this role!"
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-12,Finally a movie that shows true values and hardship. And good faith in people..

Ordinary Angels,2023-05-09,We all need a heart warming  movie  that moves us to some sort of action  even if it&#39;s just  a little  one‚ù§üòÇüéâ
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-03,"This looks like it&#39;ll be good.<br><br>Also, I love the use of &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; in the beginning. Sheryl Crow has been one of my favorite singers since I was a kid."
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-10,This reminds me of Erin Brockovich. God bless this movie. ‚ù§
Ordinary Angels,2023-08-23,Can&#39;t wait to see this movie.  The parking lot scene where the volunteers were shoveling the snow was at my church here in Louisville KY.  (Southeast Christian Church).  I remember this like it was yesterday.  The weather report predicted like 4-5 inches of snow but we got like 16 and then the real temperature plummeted to 30 below.  And then this happened.  Can&#39;t wait to see this.
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-12,Is there any movie starring Hillary Swank that isn&#39;t great?!<br><br>I have so much respect for her on her choice of roles and movies.. She&#39;s just amazing..
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-31,"this certainly teared me up....people helping people, faith and love restored, yes!"
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-09,Ok who else teared up at all the shoveling scene? I eant to see this ‚ù§
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-13,"Whoa!  This looks like a good movie and a moving story.   Those who have the ability to help, also have a responsibility to help."
Ordinary Angels,2023-06-19,This looks like the kind of movie we need right now.  What a story! The type of movie that should earn top box office.  I&#39;m in!
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-04,"It won&#39;t be good, it will be great. Anything based on love &amp; faith will always exceed expectations! üòä"
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-27,Way to go Lionsgate!<br>So glad to see real movies with moving stories coming out!
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-14,"Damn Reacher as a Dad, even more attractive üòÇ This looks like a beautiful, heartwarming movie ü´∂üèª"
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-25,"Erin Brockovich fighting the climbing costs of our health care industry!  LOVE IT, cant wait to see this one."
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-09,"Woah an originalmovie that isn&#39;t a sequel, a remake, or with super heroes? Sign me in"
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-09,nice to see a film that is about good people doing good things

Ordinary Angels,2023-05-25,"These days, we need this kind of movies more than ever!!"

Ordinary Angels,2023-05-21,I wish these types of movies were the most popular movies these days!! This is exactly the kind of movie I love! No woke bs propaganda. Just a good ol movie that pulls at the heartstrings
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-19,"Really looking forward to. And I am truly sorry that the Alaska Daily was cut. Until now, I was not very familiar with Hillary Swank&#39;s work, but I fell in love with her in that TV series, she plays a fantastic role as an investigative reporter! üíñüíñüíñ"

Ordinary Angels,2023-11-26,"WOW is right, I went through a rough life and have met darkness and evil at its purest form. To feel the love of someone who has just come back to my life after 20 years and loves me so unconditionally is truly angelic. Can‚Äôt wait to see just off of that preview."
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-14,"Honestly, for someone who is all out of hope and faith. I need this to get it back."

Ordinary Angels,2023-08-16,"Looks like a fabulous film. I cried with the trailer, can&#39;t imagine what the film itself will be like. Very well done!"

Ordinary Angels,2023-07-11,I can&#39;t wait to see this touching movie! I just love Hillary Swank my kitty is named Holly from her portrayal in the movie  P.S. I Love You I saw that movie shortly after my husband passed. I watched it over and over a moving story.

Ordinary Angels,2023-06-13,This trailer just melted my heart ü•π
Ordinary Angels,2023-10-03,Stories like this based on real examples is what we all need right now more than ever.‚ù§
Ordinary Angels,2023-07-26,You can‚Äôt lose when Reacher is on the job. Looks like a nice movie.
Ordinary Angels,2023-07-23,This movie gives me Erin Brokovich vibes ......when Julia Roberts nailed it and made her character unforgettable....looks like Hilary Swank is off for the same here üòäüòä
Ordinary Angels,2023-05-21,Wow!! I always love true story movies! Pretty much love
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,I just want Jeremy Allen White to be cast as a character with a stable family life.
The Iron Claw,2024-01-12,"For anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen this magnificent film yet, please don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking you have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this one. This is a deeply emotional story about brotherhood and loss. In a world where biopics have been deeply oversaturated, this is one of the best ones made in recent years."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,Somebody needs to give Zac that He-man role ASAP.
The Iron Claw,2024-04-03,"Just came back from watching this. Did not think this film would emotionally break me. It&#39;s been a long time since a movie has punched me this hard. The greatest tragedy was how much love these brothers had for each other. They loved each other more than life itself. Zac Efron, made me a believer. The man can act. Through out the film, the greatest feat he had in acting was the amount of emotion and rage he had... hiding under his face. Through out the film while he didn&#39;t say anything underneath, you saw the pain of all the devastation that was happening around him. All he wanted more than anything... was to spend time with his brothers."
The Iron Claw,2023-11-09,"WOW.. The way they made it look like the actual Sportatorium.. The ring, the arena.. the outside sign.. Unbelievable. You can tell whoever made this movie really cared about it."
The Iron Claw,2023-12-23,"Just saw it. And you have to hand it to Zac Efron, he totally was immersed in his part, and he was actually pretty brilliant. He is a serious actor and I look forward to seeing what he‚Äôs gonna do next."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,Feels so odd being so hyped for a movie that is going to be very depresssing
The Iron Claw,2024-03-27,I have 3 teen boys‚Ä¶ they saw this movie together when it first came out and it has changed their relationship. It has always been good but it became even better.  It made them realize how much they love each other and that life is short and anything can happen so value and love on each other for as long as we have.
The Iron Claw,2024-01-22,"Just came back from watching this. Did not think this film would emotionally break me. It&#39;s been a long time since a movie has punched me this hard. The greatest tragedy was how much love these brothers had for each other. They loved each other more than life itself. Zac Efron, made me a believer. The man can act.

Through out the film while he didn&#39;t say anything underneath, you saw the pain of all the devastation that was happening around him. All he wanted more than anything... was to spend time with his brothers."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-26,"I grew up in Burleson, Texas in the 70s and 80s. I can tell you with 100% certainty, the Von Erichs were god-like there. Whoever is picking the material for A24 deserves a promotion. This is going to be heavy ... whether you know their story or not."
The Iron Claw,2024-01-06,"Saw it with wife.   Cried and held hands walking out after the credits.  This movie needs more press.  The box office numbers at 18 million, if accurate, are not giving this film justice.  I&#39;m not a wrestling person, but a human.  This human story is just immensely powerful.  You will remember this emotional roller-coaster for awhile.  You will want to hug your family members after this, your kids, your spouse.   Your lover."
The Iron Claw,2024-08-15,As a 52yr old man I still remember as a kid LOVING the Von Erich brothers... and then one day they all just stopped being on TV.  I never knew why... üò≠
The Iron Claw,2023-10-14,A24 does better quality movies than 90% from all other Hollywood entertainment companies.
The Iron Claw,2023-12-03,Zac Efron is really (pleasantly) surprising me with his choices the past few years. This juicy role will give his acting talent a real chance to shine again. I hope he‚Äôs  properly recognized for it
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,Kinda crazy how zac efron was pretty much the only one to be super successful in the movie industry out of all the cast of high school musical. Insanely talented. Kudos to him.
The Iron Claw,2024-03-12,Why didn‚Äôt this movie get more recognition?!  Fantastic.  This deserved an Oscar!  Powerful.  Zac Efron is brilliant.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,So happy for Zac
The Iron Claw,2023-12-15,"I was 17 and worked security for Will Rodgers Coliseum in Fort Worth where they wrestled every Monday night. The Von Erichs were our heroes. It was like walking next to Superman. It was my job for a time to carry the wrestler&#39;s clothes and props to the back. I would even get to help a wrestler from time to time. I got to appear in the opening (3 seconds.lol) of the Highlander movie. It was a magic. I was the kid that got to carry Superman&#39;s cape. Thank you, Von Erichs."
The Iron Claw,2024-01-02,"Just saw this yesterday. I‚Äôm still processing my emotions, this is a film that is going to linger on your heart and mind for long time. It was so well done, so well casted. I had no idea what I was walking into but I‚Äôm glad I saw it, probably the best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long while."
The Iron Claw,2024-05-25,"I&#39;m 53, I would sit in front of our TV and watch every Von Erich entrance. Seemed those days would last forever. I loved these brothers."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-17,‚ÄúI used to have 4 four brothers now I‚Äôm no longer a brother.‚Äù<br>-Kevin Von Erich üò¢
The Iron Claw,2024-02-18,Just finished it. As a middle child with 3 brothers who aren‚Äôt in my life anymore‚Ä¶ this movie broke me. 10/10 amazing film.
The Iron Claw,2024-01-23,It‚Äôs a sin that this movie didn‚Äôt get any Oscar nominations. Zac absolutely deserved one.
The Iron Claw,2024-05-28,"So impressed by this movie - it took me back to the times. I grew up watching this bunch. Im born and raised Texan - I am saddened and yet so proud. Thank y&#39;all, for representing and entertaining us. You, your family still make Texas Proud. God Bless"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,"If you&#39;ve never heard of the Von Erich family, I suggest looking into their story before seeing this film if you&#39;re faint of heart because it&#39;s legit one of the most gut wrenching and tragic stories you&#39;ll ever read. Just be prepared if you plan on seeing this."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,‚ÄúOnce I had five brothers and now I‚Äôm not even a brother‚Äù the saddest quote I‚Äôve even heard
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"I just learned about the Von Erich family and the tragedies that they have endured over the years, this film is gonna hit me so hard. The cast looks incredible. Can‚Äôt wait to watch the film!"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-20,"For the VERY FIRST TIME in my life, I have a movie that I can see in the theater with my Uncle who introduced me to wrestling in 1991 when I was just 4 years old. He always told me stories about the Von Erichs and the Fabulous Freebirds rivalry and now after 32 years, we finally have our own movie to go see together and his health is on the decline pretty badly so I‚Äôm very happy to be able to share this moment with him. üôèüôèüôè"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"For wrestling fans we know just how hard this is gonna hit<br><br>For non-wrestling fans, oh boy get ready‚Ä¶"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,A24 killing it AGAIN. This looks phenomenal. As a pro wrestling fan I‚Äôve been waiting so long for a movie like this. Hope it wins an Oscar.
The Iron Claw,2024-05-20,Just saw this movie and went in blind just thinking it was gonna be an action sports movie. Was not ready for the story that unfolded. Such an emotional rollercoaster that I was not anticipating at all. Amazing film my goodness üò≠
The Iron Claw,2024-02-25,‚ÄúI used to be a brother. And now I‚Äôm not a brother anymore.‚Äù<br><br>Zac Efron ROBBED of a nomination.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"Along with 2008‚Äôs The Wrestler, seeing what these performers go through and the sacrifices they make in the name of entertainment is something. I hope by watching movies like this, people begin to respect these athletes. <br><br>I‚Äôm stoked for this one."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-15,A24 is rising the ranks of hollywood with really good quality movies while also letting creators do their things and paying everyone equally for the work they did.
The Iron Claw,2024-11-24,The fact that Zac Efron wasn&#39;t nominated for an Oscar is criminal
The Iron Claw,2023-12-30,My best friend and I went to go see this last night and we were both absolutely blown away. It&#39;s heartbreakingly sad and beautifully made. The acting was very good and kept our attention the entire time. Zac was beyond brillant as Kevin. The whole cast was gold üéâ
The Iron Claw,2023-11-22,i really love that shot at the start where hes going back and forth between the ropes. that building of tension is incredible.
The Iron Claw,2024-01-15,"Went to the theaters on a whim and saw this movie with no clue what it was about, not a wrestling fan or anything, didn‚Äôt know about this family‚Ä¶ one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a long time!"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"Once i heard &quot;People said our family was cursed&quot;, I knew it about the Von Erichs! One of the saddest stories about one of the most talented families in wrestling. My Grandma once said that they were &quot;Simply the FINEST men she had ever laid eyes on&quot;."
The Iron Claw,2024-01-02,"Just got out of the movie theatre‚Ä¶.<br><br>I‚Äôm speechless. This is one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen and I mean that. What an amazing story, messages, cinematography, soundtrack, artistic lens, and emotional rollercoaster!  <br><br>12/10 Hands down üôåüèΩüò≠üíØüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"Holy shit he actually became the &quot;the bear&quot;, he looks HUGE"
The Iron Claw,2024-05-02,Zac‚Äôs best role to date. He definitely deserved heavy consideration for an Oscar this role. Soul touching movie &amp; performance üí™üèæüî•üôèüèæü•≤
The Iron Claw,2023-10-19,"As a huge old-school wrestling and Kerry Von Erich fan, I&#39;m so excited for this movie. It looks so well made and I know how tragic the cursed life of the Von Erich&#39;s was, so this will make for a deep and powerful rollercoaster of a film."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,"This movie is going to be one of the most tragic wrestling stories to be shown for big audiences. As a wrestling superfan, the von Erich story is not about a curse, it&#39;s just about the unity of brothers who got into the wrestling business by a legendary but tough father who controlled them and broke them down to turn them into wrestling superstars in Texas, for WCCW (World Class Championship Wrestling). I hope that the story will be very truthful and respectful to the Von Erichs, but show the actual horrible truth about their struggles with depression, drug addiction, and just breaking their bodies and minds to keep WCCW successful by their father, but soon with all of it, all the brothers, except for Kevin, would be dead by their own addiction or by their own hands due to what they went through. So far, the movie looks good, Zac Efron looks a bit weird cast for Kevin Von Erich, but to be honest, movies shouldn&#39;t cast people for looks, but only for their acting chops, so I just hope Zac will do Kevin Von Erich right, but everyone else looks good enough for their respected roles. I&#39;m praying that the movie is great because I think Wrestling should be told more in Movies, like what the wrestler was or now The Iron Claw, I think the wrestling business is very dramatic and eventful for a movie, but yet has very awful, tragic stories that could be a good portrayal for a movie. I hope it does well."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"I was already hyped for the cast, but Holt McCallany as the Dad made this a must-see for me! I miss Mindhunter so much!"
The Iron Claw,2024-05-20,Just saw this masterpiece.. woah credit to Zac Efron you&#39;re a hell of a guy and future legend IMO! Jeremy Allen White and Harris Dickinson did a really good job too
The Iron Claw,2023-10-20,There&#39;s just something about A24 films that really draw my attention. It&#39;s not simply the pure\raw ideas and adaptions but the video quality of it all. Truly something pure and magnificent. I legit wouldn&#39;t have a second thought if they had their own streaming service no matter the cost.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,"Dude, give a raise to whoever put this trailer together ! This was phenomenal! Hyped for this movie."
The Iron Claw,2023-12-28,"Just saw this in the theater and lemme tell ya: if ever you&#39;ve seen a trailer and wondered if it lived up to the actual film, this is the one. It&#39;ll be a crime against humanity if no one gets a major award from this. It really is that good."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"Seeing Kerry on a motorcycle, knowing what happened, gave me chills."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,So happy for Zac. Such a great string of dramatic and comedic work.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,Zac has really nailed down the voice and mannerisms of Kevin from what I&#39;ve seen so far. This is going to be one hell of a devastating film.
The Iron Claw,2024-05-04,"Incredible movie. The whole movie, you could feel the heavy, emotional, unbreakable bond and love these brothers had for one another. So tragic, but what an awesome ending with Kevins whole family coming to their ranch."
The Iron Claw,2023-11-27,That &quot;I told you to look out for him&quot; had to be fritz yelling at Kevin over one of the other brothers death. The emotion and anger in that one line is fantastic. Im prepared to cry that night
The Iron Claw,2023-12-23,I just left the theater. This movie was excellent! I can‚Äôt remember the last time I shed a tear while watching a film.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,I&#39;m so proud of Zac. He&#39;s really come a long way since his Disney days. I hope he&#39;s still acting when he&#39;s 70. I see a few Oscars under his belt before he retires.
The Iron Claw,2024-05-30,Saddest movie I&#39;ve seen in years. Excellent job from the actors.
The Iron Claw,2023-12-29,"I do not care one bit about watching sports or learning about sports history, AND YET I adored this movie. Excellent writing, directing, cinematography, and acting across the board. Good filmmaking can any subject matter engaging and entertaining- this is proof positive. A worse team behind this film would have made me feel alienated and bored for not already being knowledgeable of or interested in wrestling, but this was a beautifully heartbreaking film."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,I‚Äôm a kid of the 80s and I remember them ‚Äì they were huge ‚Äì they‚Äôre still talked about as being some of the best. There‚Äôs only one of them left now ‚Äì terrible tragedy hit that family. I can‚Äôt wait to see this.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-16,One of the most gifted and talented families in the history of wrestling. A story which needs to be told and will do extreme justice to the name.
The Iron Claw,2024-05-26,&quot;You must be my older brother...nice to meet you&quot; instant waterworks
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,"i cannot express how much this movie means to me,i grew up watching these brothers mourned the yellow rose of texas,cheered kerrys championship win over the nature boy,watched every match they had with the freebirds,wccw was our religion, i cannot wait,but as excited as i am,i know its going to be ruff to relive it,the good and the bad,we were young happy care free,and their love for each other made me and my bros bond stronger,thank u and god bless the von erichs"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-22,As much as it breaks my heart watching this trailer it makes me happy to know that the legacy of the Von Erich‚Äôs live on. To me the greatest family in the history of professional wrestling.
The Iron Claw,2023-12-24,"For me personally, best movie I‚Äôve seen this year. Everyone in the theater was crying."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,"For anyone that knows their history, the moment in the trailer that guitar riff hit... I know you felt it."
The Iron Claw,2024-05-19,"I was finally able to see this absolutely wonderful movie today, 5/18/24. Kerry Von Erich was the first professional wrestler I saw wrestle barefoot as a kid. For some reason, that just blew me away. Fritz, clearly was living out his failures in wrestling through them boys. So f*cked up they chose to take themselves out.üò¢  I completely lost it at the end of the movie when they showed Kevin with his extended family. So incredibly happy for him overcoming everything. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,A24 making movies the people want to see!
The Iron Claw,2024-03-01,I saw Kerry Von Erich wrestle when I was 6 yrs old.  The NWA came to my tiny hometown and put on a show at our high schools football field.  Still remember it 40 yrs later.  These guys were legendary.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-14,Zac continues to make incredible choices for roles. He has become a generational talent.
The Iron Claw,2024-04-29,What a awesome movie. Zac deserved a award for this movie
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,What a nice wholesome looking Christmas movie
The Iron Claw,2024-02-24,"The last 15 to 20 mins of this movie, just hit different.<br>Great Movie, even if you wasn&#39;t/aren&#39;t a  Wrestling fan, i would still recommend this.<br>‚úåÔ∏è"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,"Im so glad they chose their story for this.  I grew up going to their matches live, they were amazing and always sweet to their fans.  Everytime tragedy struck their family it hit hard, so i hope they do their story justice."
The Iron Claw,2024-05-07,Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White deserved Oscar Nominations for this.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,I just can‚Äôt get enough of Jeremy Allen White ‚ù§
The Iron Claw,2023-10-14,"Good movie, good scenes, good soundtrack, something to be excited about. Nothing crazy. Something real. Thank you"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,Damn Zac Efron is a beast. Im excited for his acting
The Iron Claw,2024-04-04,It‚Äôs a sin that this movie didn‚Äôt get any Oscar nominations. Zac absolutely deserved one
The Iron Claw,2023-12-26,saw this today. i wasn&#39;t alive in the 80s but my gen x parents love showing me their matches on youtube whenever we drink in the living room. the way my parents could go on for hours about how iconic they were. i just saw this movie today and my goodness the ending made me cry.
The Iron Claw,2023-12-13,Haven&#39;t stepped into a movie theater in YEARS and you better believe I&#39;m bringing my son to this opening day. Looks incredible and got goosebumps from the trailer already ! Love Zach and my boy Lip! Underrated actors and the best production. THIS has been needed
The Iron Claw,2024-02-23,"One of get best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. No spoilers, but the monologue/scene at the end with his two sons when they were wrestling in the grass had me sobbing. Zac Efron is pure talent."
The Iron Claw,2023-12-22,"This movie exceeded my expectations, every character moves you and you‚Äôll want to hold onto your siblings longer ‚ù§üíî‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πtakes you back to the emotional toughness most of us grew up with, bravo to the cast made this one tough girl cry üëè"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,"I&#39;m not huge on wrestling, but I have good friends that love it. You don&#39;t need to love wrestling to appreciate this story, and based on the trailer, the execution of bringing it to life will make it that much better. I can&#39;t wait for this film."
The Iron Claw,2023-11-09,This just brought tears to me eyes. My favorite wrestling family. Greatest Texans of all time. Can&#39;t wait to see this movie. I know I&#39;ll probably very the wholetime. Especially the funeral scene. We all mourn each one of them as if they were blood relatives. Best part of my childhood was watching them in the ring‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
The Iron Claw,2024-04-07,"Right after I was born October 18, 1980, my mom and dad, with my 3 older brothers met the Von Erich&#39;s, ALL OF THEM at DFW airport after they had fun at Six Flags in Arlington. We headed back to San Antonio. We took a picture with them. It&#39;s in the archives somewhere, but we did that. They became my favorite wrestling family after that. Kevin &amp; Kerry were mine. We&#39;ve had a lot of Iconic entertainers in Texas history in my lifetime die or be killed WAAY TOO YOUNG, but I&#39;m glad they existed at least for me to grow up seeing them. RIP Kingsüëë &amp; Queensüëë"
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,Man .. ZACK EFRON is so CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED.
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,"Zac is an amazing actor. Not all actors can go extreme just for their roles. First Baywatch, now this."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,Seeing the Von Erich brothers in the ring fighting the Fabulous Freebirds hit me so hard &amp; completely took me back to my childhood.  Knowing that only two of the six people in that ring are still around is insane.  You could do a series on just World Class Championship Wrestling &amp; you will find too many tragic stories.
The Iron Claw,2024-11-22,"I can&#39;t believe a movie about wrestling made me cry at the end, simply amazing."
The Iron Claw,2023-12-31,"I haven‚Äôt seen this film yet, but I already know it‚Äôs gonna be beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. The visuals, the accuracy that went into making the Sportatorium look as good as it does.. there was so much love and care that went into this film and it needed to be made. The Von Erich‚Äôs are a piece of wrestling history that doesn‚Äôt get enough credit. They not only made tag team wrestling what it is today, but without them, wrestling wouldn‚Äôt be where it‚Äôs at today. I wasn‚Äôt alive during their time, but my mother has told me countless stories about how big they were. I remember her telling me a story about how they came to town one summer and the excitement and talk of the town was so crazy that you would‚Äôve thought that the Beatles were coming."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-12,"Just watching the trailer alone is giving me goosebumps. As a huge wrestling fan, especially from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, this is definitely going to hit hard."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-11,This looks incredible.  I literally got chills and my eyes started to water slightly just watching this trailer.  I never really knew too much about the Von Erich&#39;s growing up but I watched the Dark Side Of The Ring episode about their family and  it was brutal.  Zac Efron looks like a Von Erich and it is awesome to see him get a role like this and own it.  I am both excited and nervous to watch this film.
The Iron Claw,2024-08-02,"This movie just left me so emotional, I‚Äôm too young to have seen the Von Erich‚Äôs wrestle but I did grow up watching a lot of Wrestling in the late 90‚Äôs to mid 2000‚Äôs &amp; I could not believe how tragic this was &amp; reading the Von Erich‚Äôs history just broke my heart. Zac Efron delivered an incredible performance, Jeremy Allen White was great as well. This movie blew me away, I understand they could have included more but I understand runtime is important to people as well."
The Iron Claw,2023-11-08,"I&#39;m sure everyone is a fan of the younger members of the cast, but this trailer gives me hope that Holt McCallany may have finally found a role and a script that allowed him to shine. His scenes look intense and make great use of his screen presence and physical demeanor. Sincerely hoping it turns out as good as it looks. Reminds me of early feelings I got about &quot;Everything, Everywhere, All At Once&quot; before its release."
The Iron Claw,2023-10-13,Ive always dreamed of a movie like this.I am so glad the right company is behind it
The Watchers,2024-04-22,I like how they actually didn&#39;t show the monsters in the trailer for once. Way more suspense that way.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Glad that Dakota is still active. I grew up watching her movies. War of the Worlds made me love her.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Two Shyamalan films this year - now THAT&#39;s an unexpected twist.
The Watchers,2024-04-23,Dakota Fanning deserves a long great career! I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôll be back in big time productions <br>The range we‚Äôll get is a treat
The Watchers,2024-05-01,"Ive never heard of this book. Immediately bought it, read it, and just finished it. It was amazing. I hope the movie doesnt change too much. The twist ending was amazing. I can&#39;t believe how painfully obvious it was, but i never saw it coming. Such a good mystery box story."
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"Georgina Campbell is so underated, hope she shines here"
The Watchers,2024-05-21,Ishana Night Shyamalan &amp; M. Night Shyamalan films this year - WOW
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"Can&#39;t believe this is Shyamalan&#39;s daughter&#39;s first directorial debut, this already looks like a prominently chiseled piece by a trained artist.<br>We got ‚ÄòTrap‚Äô by her dad and now this. Absolutely otherworldly!"
The Watchers,2024-04-23,Why does this give me a &#39;FROM&#39; series reminder... Beautiful!<br>Love it!!!! Yassss
The Watchers,2024-04-22,We‚Äôve missed you Dakota‚ù§Ô∏è
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"Always really sweet to see people carrying on their family legacy.<br><br>David Cronenberg&#39;s son, and now Shylaman&#39;s daughter."
The Watchers,2024-05-10,It‚Äôs so weird seeing Dakota fanning all grown up ha I remember her movies in my childhood ü§Ø
The Watchers,2024-04-29,Im so happy..Dakota is recognised...She&#39;s a top class actor..n so much beautiful than many!
The Watchers,2024-04-24,"The Sinead O&#39;Connor song at the start is beautiful, what a legend"
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Dakota Fanning &amp; Georgina Campbell are gonna both be just so very incredible in The Watchers!
The Watchers,2024-05-03,"Dakota Fanning is such a marvel to watch, anything with her am sold!"
The Watchers,2024-05-17,So happy to see Dakota in a film! I feel like she hasn&#39;t been cast enough as an adult. Loved her in her movie about autism she did a great job. Def will see this one too. :)
The Watchers,2024-04-22,The Shyamalan fam is bringing some of that originality back to Hollywood.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Wow Shyamalan family is really talented!!<br>It‚Äôs fascinating how the daughter got his twisted vision üòÇ
The Watchers,2024-04-24,I love Shyamalan&#39;s movies. He&#39;s different than everyone else. Hope good things come from his daughter too.
The Watchers,2024-06-06,"I just watched this film, and it&#39;s fantastic!<br>Of course, the film has issues, but most do. But as a non-critique who doesn&#39;t post film reviews, I was shocked at how good this modern horror film is. I&#39;m not going to spoil anything! For those who haven&#39;t watched it.¬†<br>I didn&#39;t want to watch the movie initially but decided to do it anyway. My friend and I were the only ones in the entire cinema. <br><br><br>I watched the trailer and didn&#39;t care too much about it since every trailer spoils everything, and this one didn&#39;t. Halfway through the film, my friend and I were shocked at how amazing this technique worked because we were both scared of them because of the unknown ‚Äòcreatures‚Äô we never saw in the trailer. <br>Absolutely a great film that needs to be watched. And now I want a 2nd one üò≠"
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"As a book fan I should urge people to read it first, but going in blind should be phenomenal üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
The Watchers,2024-04-24,It&#39;s good to see Dakota Fanning back üôå
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Good to see Dakota fanning back in the spotlight again.
The Watchers,2024-06-05,I swear if the bird dies
The Watchers,2024-04-22,read the book guys!! its really good
The Watchers,2024-04-22,I‚Äôm kinda Excited for This Movie Anyone Excited for this too?
The Watchers,2024-04-24,Thank you trailer for reminding me to listen to &quot;the lion the witch and the cobra&quot; again. <br>Shineads &quot;never get old&quot; is such a great song from an incredible album.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,This shares many similarities with &#39;From&quot;. A very underrated horror/thriller TV series!
The Watchers,2024-04-22,The Shyamalans doing their work. üòåüî•
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Looks good! Was impressed with Dakota‚Äôs performance in Ripley recently
The Watchers,2024-05-15,The book by A. M. Shine is amazing. So excited to see the adaptation!
The Watchers,2024-06-01,"Dakota is the best actress of all time in work as well as character, we love you"
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Sinead &amp; Enya track!! ‚ÄúNever Gets Old‚Äù.
The Watchers,2024-04-23,Looks like the movie&#39;s taking inspiration based off the eerie phenomenon of the unsolved missing 411 cases. Always creeped me out hearing about the cases of people suddenly vanishing in the forest alone leaving no trail or clues of how they disappeared. What&#39;s even more chilling is the fact that alot of those cases have way too many similarities not to be connected somehow but they never could be explained.
The Watchers,2024-04-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY&amp;t=104"">1:44</a> the trailer should have ended there."
The Watchers,2024-04-23,Here is one of the videos I&#39;ve been waiting for. Thanks to everyone who contributed. Always within art ‚ô•
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Dakota is so grown up! Glad to see her again!
The Watchers,2024-04-22,ive always loved Dakota Fanning
The Watchers,2024-04-26,M Night Shyamalan and Dakota Fanning‚Ä¶.yes please! Cannot wait!!!
The Watchers,2024-04-24,M. Knight has been on a roll the last few years. Looks great.
The Watchers,2024-04-24,"Love seeing little Dakota Fanning &amp; Shyamalan doing comebacks. It&#39;s taking me back to the early 00s. When sci-fi movies were popular during that time. I know Dakota is all grown up. But to me, she&#39;ll always be a child actor. Love her in Man on Fire with Denzel Washington. Creasy Bear! üò≠ Still a great movie."
The Watchers,2024-05-22,"I saw the title of this video, bought and read the book in two days and now I cant wait!üòä"
The Watchers,2024-05-31,I listened to the book in one go during a ten hour shift and it is amazing.. This trailer reveals way more than it should which is sad! I really hope this is good because this is an amazing book and A.M. Shine deserves huge credit for the book! Dakota Fanning is also a great casting as Mina. I really hope Madeline‚Äôs actress is as good as she looks and the spoilers to some of the plot that‚Äôll be a dead give away to anyone who watches the trailers does not ruin the experience
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Reminds me of FROM. Looks good!
The Watchers,2024-04-23,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY&amp;t=164"">2:44</a> I swear I saw something move in the background. It could be the watchers? Is that what they look like?"
The Watchers,2024-04-23,"Landed here after checking ‚Äùwatchers channel update&quot;, thank you YouTube<br>Edit : Interesting trailer"
The Watchers,2024-06-02,I Love ‚ù§ DAKOTA FANNING I can&#39;t wait too see this üòç
The Watchers,2024-04-24,I was one of the Extras there!<br>From Galway
The Watchers,2024-04-22,I have and still just adore Fanning voice
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Like father like...daughter!
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"Finished reading the book. So far, it&#39;s looking good. I recognised many scenes from the book. But the books have some plot holes too. It would be nice to see how the director handle these things. Very excited."
The Watchers,2024-04-23,"Okay, I&#39;ve been listening to the Audible for 1.5 weeks now and am at nearly the end. I only bought and listened to the book because of how interesting the previous trailer was. And now, I&#39;m already irritated that the damn bird has now been switched from something the local drunk Peter gave her to sell and deliver to now it&#39;s her bird. I think it meant way more that she was willing to protect a bird she had just met. But so happy to see a longer trailer now that I&#39;m almost done with the book! Can&#39;t wait to see the visuals on what is surely to be a thrilling story!"
The Watchers,2024-04-22,What Warner Bros. Pictures Animation needs is a new animated movie released in theaters in 2024.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Ishana Night Shyamalan daughter of Famous M Night Shyamalan ... directed this masterpiece.. at this point we can say she was learned a lot from her DAD... early waiting
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY&amp;t=26"">0:26</a> no Warner Bros logo?"
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"My prediction is they&#39;re aliens, and we&#39;re the watchers"
The Watchers,2024-05-13,M Night produced it so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s plentiful in suspense and an intriguing watch.
The Watchers,2024-05-21,M Night Shaymalan is that weird kid in class you end up liking cos he&#39;s actually cool in a dark way....I love all his work!
The Watchers,2024-04-29,Living in the world today‚Ä¶nothing scares me anymore
The Watchers,2024-04-22,"Between this and the movie Trap from M. Night, the Shyamalan family is about to cook and I am here for itüëè"
The Watchers,2024-05-31,Dakota making a nice comeback! She is a great actress!
The Watchers,2024-06-02,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY&amp;t=4"">0:04</a> never say that to a bird friend‚Ä¶what kind of horrible eldritch would harm one?"
The Watchers,2024-05-29,"I love Dakota Fanning, I think she‚Äôs fantastic in all her work‚ù§"
The Watchers,2024-05-21,dont know about anyone else but i just love to drive through a creepy forest every weekend. cant get enough of it.
The Watchers,2024-04-22,Never trust a trailer when M. Night is involved.
Tarot,2024-01-31,"The card design is phenomenal, really hope they&#39;ll release a deck as merch."
Tarot,2024-01-30,"I hope at some point, during the story, a character will do a &quot;Google Search&quot; on how to stop the curse."
Tarot,2024-01-30,I love how Trevor Henderson (creator of Siren head) is the designer for the entities! His designs need to be represented in films more often!
Tarot,2024-01-30,This gave me ‚ÄúScary Stories to Tell in the Dark‚Äù vibes.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for this one.
Tarot,2024-01-31,"The plot doesn&#39;t look promising, but the designs are top tier. Would watch for fun"
Tarot,2024-01-30,"Might end up being a generic horror film, but the production design on this looks great!"
Tarot,2024-02-10,"As a Tarot Card Reader and deck collector, I find the deck in this movie pretty interesting.  I hope it is released to the public in the future."
Tarot,2024-02-01,It‚Äôs literally final destination with tarot cards and I‚Äôm here for it
Tarot,2024-01-30,"Not another piece of media misrepresenting the &#39;Death&#39; card. Hopefully they&#39;ll point that out, because it basically just means the end of something and a new beginning.<br>The tower card is the one you should (edit: mostly, although not necessarily) be wary about. Still, looks like it&#39;s more based on the (pretty awesome) art and not really what the cards really mean."
Tarot,2024-03-12,I&#39;m glad they showed us the whole movie and who will die by what means.
Tarot,2024-04-07,love how the poster shows the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù card as if it‚Äôs somethin horrifyin <br>‚Äúoh no!! oh god!! i‚Äôve grown as a person!! a chapter of my life has passed!! have mercy!!‚Äù
Tarot,2024-01-30,The choir of children naming each of the arcana is hilarious though
Tarot,2024-02-01,The promo for the next YuGiOH card set is üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Tarot,2024-02-05,"As a Tarot Reader / Teacher, this is hilarious! I am sure it will be a good laugh of a movie."
Tarot,2024-01-31,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE all the lit candles right next to the lamp. JUST TURN ON THE DAMN LAMP!!!
Tarot,2024-01-30,As a tarot reader this trailer cracked me up
Tarot,2024-01-30,The closest thing we can get to an UNO horror movie
Tarot,2024-01-30,The title was formerly known as Horrorscope.
Tarot,2024-02-06,I‚Äôm a tarot card reader and a horror movie enthusiast and I kid you not a couple of days ago I asked myself why there weren‚Äôt any movies/shows about tarot and I stumble across this trailer today. ü§≠ STOKED.
Tarot,2024-04-16,I&#39;m actually surprised that I like this. I love the idea of them coming alive.
Tarot,2024-01-31,Omg I want to watch this so bad especially as a tarot reader. I love the fact that each card seems to be used as a concept in the film. Even if it‚Äôs cheesy for the love of tarot I must watch.
Tarot,2024-02-07,"As a tarot card reader, I would love this tarot card deck."
Tarot,2024-02-04,If a stranger&#39;s deck looked that terrifying (it&#39;s excellent by the way) I wouldn&#39;t dream of using it.
Tarot,2024-04-12,One thing they got right: ‚ÄúYou never use another‚Äôs cards‚Äù it brings bad luck and possibly curses or a hex if done in a ritual
Tarot,2024-01-30,Normally I don&#39;t care about tarot stuff but this is exactly how you grab my attention! üòÇ
Tarot,2024-01-31,Thank you for sharing most of the story plot!
Tarot,2024-01-30,Love the designs of the entities. Very cool.
Tarot,2024-04-07,This giving me Final Destination vibes &amp; energy
Tarot,2024-01-30,The random establishing shot of Boston was totally necessary
Tarot,2024-01-31,"I&#39;m so so so happy that Trevor Henderson is the one who designed the monsters, they all look cool asf :D"
Tarot,2024-01-30,I like that there‚Äôs different demons and the costume designs on them look cool
Tarot,2024-02-02,Great to see Avantika getting roles in mainstream movies. Go girl!
Tarot,2024-01-30,Amy Rose: This is why I only use MY Tarot Cards.
Tarot,2024-04-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvDArsKoTOE&amp;t=41"">0:41</a> üó£üó£üó£üó£ <b>FOLLOW ONE RULE TO STAY OUT OF DANGER</b> üî•üî•üî•üî•"
Tarot,2024-01-31,this definitely isn&#39;t going to help with the misinformation that already plagues tarot and people who have no idea what tarot is üòÇ
Tarot,2024-01-31,about time they did a movie about Tarot cards!!
Tarot,2024-01-30,this is NOT your average game of tarotüòÇüòÇ
Tarot,2024-01-30,Made me think of 13 Ghosts. Haven&#39;t seen that movie in forever!! This looks fun though.
Tarot,2024-01-31,I love these 2 minute movies.
Tarot,2024-01-31,we had so much fun filming this!! üíÄüÉè So happy we can share a bit of the adventure
Tarot,2024-04-03,Okay I saw this trailer in the theater and it legit looks SCARY. Good job!!!
Tarot,2024-02-03,I always love the little teaser beforehand to let me know that 2 seconds after I clicked on the video with the title Tarot Trailer that the Tarot Trailer is about to begin. Thanks.
Tarot,2024-02-01,Got me some Talk to me vibes. Looking forward to it.
Tarot,2024-01-31,"I can already tell they failed to consult any actual tarot readers, wiccans, pagans, metaphysical shop owners,  phone psychics , renaissance faire palmstry volunteers, or witchy goth chicks before making this movie. Not even a cursory google of the card meanings?? At least the creature designs are super cool."
Tarot,2024-01-30,"And this is why you don&#39;t touch people&#39;s tarot cards. You never know what they&#39;ve practiced and you&#39;re essentially taking on their energy. Be respectful, be cautious, don&#39;t be stupid.<br><br>On that note, I can&#39;t wait to see this!"
Tarot,2024-02-02,"The movie reminds me of Thirteen ghosts movie. It&#39;s an old horror movie that has a different story for sure, but the introduction for every demonic entity is pretty similar to the old one. Well, I like that trailer about Tarot, so I&#39;ll watch it for sure :)"
Tarot,2024-01-30,&quot;Talk to Me&quot; with cards üòÖ
Tarot,2024-01-30,This is why you follow the rules when it comes to tarot cards
Tarot,2024-01-30,It‚Äôs the heart of the cards
Tarot,2024-03-28,"This looks actually amazing. Love the  uniqueness of each creature and scares. Heard the creatures are made by Trever Henderson, Is that true? If it is, then this is gonna be amazing."
Tarot,2024-03-23,this looks beyond amazing especially the lighting color grading looks so well done
Tarot,2024-01-31,As a tarot reader myself... this is hilarious af
Tarot,2024-02-01,"As someone who is doing Tarot themself and really likes horror movies, I&#39;m really excited for this one!"
Tarot,2024-01-31,The hang man scene got me üòÇ
Tarot,2024-02-06,"This looks like innocent dumb popcorn fun.  Not annoyed at all.  Like not every movie needs to be an A24 thinker.  Sometimes stupid kids are gonna make stupid choices with obviously cursed objects they randomly find in a hell house basement.  üòÇ <br><br>The haunted game concept isn‚Äôt revolutionary, but it‚Äôs still kind of fun and fresh to give each tarot character a spooky redesign.  Looking forward to seeing their death and devil cards come to life.  üëç"
Tarot,2024-03-27,how men see tarot:
Tarot,2024-01-30,"In a way,, it gives me a 13 ghost/final destination type vibe where it seems each person who had a reading gets killed by a different type of creature/entity."
Tarot,2024-01-30,"OK, although this might be entertaining to watch, this doesn&#39;t necessarily help break the thoughts of super religious people (like my folks) who were taught and taught me this was evil....lol<br><br>So, now that I read Tarot, have a channel for reading as well, if by chance they see just this commercial they gonna be terrified even more so of me and the fact they will think I&#39;m going to hell hahahahaha üòÖüòÇüòä"
Tarot,2024-02-06,Wow. So unique. It really had me going. I hope I don‚Äôt die in my sleep because seeing this movie is now my life‚Äôs goal.
Tarot,2024-01-31,"The trailer revealed so much of the monsters but hey, I‚Äôm still excited to watch this üòÇ"
Tarot,2024-01-30,"As intrigued as I am for this, does anyone else feel the trailer showed a bit too much? It seems like we saw all the creatures from the cards and we possibly have seen one character‚Äôs guaranteed death from the ladder falling (supposedly) and even though we know most characters are doomed in these kinds of films, still could‚Äôve left a few surprises. Possibly will be anyways."
Tarot,2024-02-04,the tarot readers entered the group
Tarot,2024-01-30,"The concept is truly interesting,but I think it has huge chances to be poorly executed,teen horror movies are usually really bad executed nowadays,but might be a surprise as well<br>Cool creature design"

Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,"When I was a child, I had a nightmare about an evil, elderly Harold and his purple crayon. This trailer brings that memory back. Thanks."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-06-23,"I used to watch Harold and the purple crayon when I was a baby and it was a sweet show that taught me important lessons about imagination and kindness. It wasn‚Äôt an action comedy about a REAL magic crayon, it was about a kid who would daydream and travel places. This is like one of those collegehumor joke posts but as a real movie"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,"This didn&#39;t need to be anything more than what it already was, a great, simple, core childhood memory."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-23,"Thank god for the 5 second clip at the start telling me the trailer was about to start, I didn&#39;t know if the trailer was about to start!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,I wish Purple Crayon drawing should be 2D animation in the real world
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,"They won&#39;t stop till they squeeze every last drop of nostalgia out of us, huh?"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"Is it just me, or does this feel like Zachary Levi playing the role of Shazam, who&#39;s playing the role of Harold?"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-05-07,"Rudy got the chalk, chalk, chalk zone."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-12,‚ÄúWhat if anything you drew came to life?‚Äù Me: CHALKZONE
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,I&#39;m not gonna lie... this should&#39;ve remained 2D animated. But we&#39;ll see how this movie is
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"I knew Harold would grow up, but I didn&#39;t expect him to grow up in the animated world."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,So Harold grows up and ends up in the real world. That makes sense.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-09,Harold grew up.üíú
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-25,"In India, we the 90&#39;s kids, used to watch a TV show for children named &quot;Shakalaka Boom Boom&quot;(started in 2000) in which the child protagonist had a magic pencil and whatever he drew with that pencil  on a drawing sheet came to life/became real. We children loved it so much."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,There is a 50/50 chance that this movie will get mixed reviews
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"&quot;I&#39;m Harold, and you&#39;re watching Disney channel&quot; üíÄ"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-09,Harold&#39;s crayon‚ùå shaka laka boom boom ‚úÖ
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-09,"Harold and the Purple Crayon was my FAVORITE story when I was a kid (clear back in the late 80s/early 90s). One of the first books I ever read on my own (although my mom had read it to me countless times before I learned to read). I just saw a movie poster for this just before Easter and I freaked out because it never in my wildest imagination thought that this story would be made into a movie. The movie comes out August 2, and then 2 days later on August 4 is my 38th birthday. Best believe I&#39;ll be sitting in the audience with my purple crayon and a huge dumb grin on my face. I am SO excited for this."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"When the guy said the crayon was made of &quot;Pure Imagination,&quot; I thought, &quot;Oh no, the Wonka-verse!!??&quot;"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,&quot;Honestly I don&#39;t do a lot of thinking.&quot;<br><br>Wow this movie is self-aware.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Probably the closest we&#39;ll ever get to a ChalkZone movie.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-30,I&#39;m almost 40 and this made me happy seeing as I read the book repeatedly as a kid. Didn&#39;t even know this was coming out.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-31,Prince&#39;s  favorite book as a child was Harold and the Purple Crayon and was the reason for his love of the color purple.  üíú
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,"what this trailer needs is more loud taiko drums to emphasize just how AMAZING everything is, and how blown away you should be by all of the action!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-22,"People talking about Zachary Levi, I&#39;m seeing this just for Lil Rel Howery! Loved him in Free Guy, and I expect to love him in this too!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-28,"Ngl the adult cartoon character of Harold literally looks like the man in the yellow hat from Curious George, it reminds me of him so much idk why."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-05-22,"As someone who grew up with Hook, I have a soft spot for these &quot;what if characters grew up&quot; stories.  I hope it&#39;s well made and does well.  Also love Zachary Levi since Chuck!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-15,This kids book did not need lore my guy. This is crazy.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Kids grew up watched Harold and the Purple Crayon cartoon from 1959.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-25,"Alright, show of hands: who else thought this was some kind of Collegehumor-style shitpost joke when they first heard about it before discovering that no, they really are making a Harold and the Purple Crayon movie?"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,IVE SEEN HAROLD ONE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID AND I HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS AND HES BEEN IN MY HEAD FOR YEARS AND THIS WAS A REMINDER. THANK YOU!!!!!!!
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-29,"I&#39;m honestly kinda outraged at what they&#39;ve done to my favourite childhood book, a book that was so nice and simple. The last thing I wanted it turned into was a wacky over-the-top family comedy adventure where the little boy is played by a full grown man."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-25,Ah yes. As a child I was always so excited to see a movie about a 40 year old Harold using his crayon to draw himself a blow up doll.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-23,Harold causing friggin mayhem with that crayon
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,An Older Harold is something I never expected as an Child but If I grew up he grew up! Can&#39;t wait for this.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-24,i used to watch the cartoon as a kid back in the early 2000s. To see it now as a live-action film is mind-blowing.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-23,Yall couldnt just make this animated? Yall were doing so well with spiderverse...
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,I loved reading Harold and the Purple Crayon back in elementary school; fond memories.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"This honestly looks like fun. Sure, I‚Äôm questioning why Harold is now a grown man, but regardless, this looks good!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-06-19,Loved Lil Rel Howery&#39;s line.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-23,"Not everything needs to be remade or come back, originals are beautiful the way they are"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,First &quot;IF&quot; and now this. It was about time for movies that look &quot;for kids&quot; went back to theathers instead of ending up being released directly to streaming. Let the magic prevail. üñç‚ú®Ô∏è
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,This was my ABSOLUTE favorite book as a kid and I can&#39;t wait to see this with my kids!
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-24,"So I have a theory.<br>The trailer says that those who write a story ‚Äúcreates a whole another world‚Äù. Well I believe this world has two layers to it. One is its ‚Äúreal world‚Äù, where its people live and what not. The other is its ‚Äúfake world‚Äù, the void Harold is in as a child and as an adult. Since Harold is still wearing an adult fitted version of his pajamas that he had as a child, I believe Harold got trapped in the second layer and grew up there. That‚Äôs why he drew the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù door. Although one wonders why he didn‚Äôt drew it earlier (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do a lot of thinking indeed!)"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-29,I always wished there was a dark rendition of Harold and the Purple Crayon. A child who has a tough life but  finds joy in a world where he can solve any problem he has with his creativity. I think that could be powerful.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,I am surprised to see that Harold will be an adult in this movie instead of a child.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Hold on. I get it now. The baby is the character but he grew up. Okay that makes more sense.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-06-24,I never thought we&#39;d get a movie of this but you know what im here for it.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-22,I remember watching Harold and The Purple Crayon when I was young and here I am seeing this trailer and it‚Äôs bringing back memories
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-26,As someone who watched Harold &amp; the Purple Crayon as a child this is quite the surprise but I‚Äôm all for it üëçüèª
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,My inner 5 year old is jumping for absolute joy!! I LOOOVED this when I was little
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-17,So what im gathering is Harold is and has always been an interdimensional being with the ability to cross worlds üòÆ
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-05-07,HATPC was my favorite book as a child.  &#39;60&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,"Looks like Harold finally grew up for this movie. Anything drawn by his crayon in three dimensions resembles a blueprint for a new machine&#39;s design and a figure&#39;s wire frame! I wish that crayon would grant all miracles, luck, wishes and dreams! It could even suit the special effects machines."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"I think that I will watch it, even if critics don‚Äôt like it. The live-action debut of the director of Rio 1 &amp; 2, Ice Age 2 &amp; 3 and Ferdinand and co-director of Ice Age 1 and Robots. Rio 1 &amp; 2 were childhood movies for me. Zachary Levi is for me a great actor even after Shazam 2 became a flop."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Anything with Zachary Levi and I&#39;m watching it.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-07-29,This is so insanely cheesey broski üòÇ
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WojIv-PVYm8&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> Did that porcupine do an evil grin or is that just me?"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-23,"Okay, this looks better than I thought. I had my hesitations when I heard Harold was going to be an adult but I like it when a film adaptation can work with the source material and make its own story out of it. What would happen in Harold grew up and came to our world with his magic crayon? Thats sounds interesting. Worst case scenario it could just end up feeling like a 2000s style comedy but just based on this trailer...it doesn&#39;t look that bad."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,This feels like it came out in the early 2000s
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Harold and the Purple Crayon was a HUGE part of my childhood and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie!!!!
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-05-27,I read Harold and the purple crayon as a child! This makes my childhood dreams come true
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"My first reaction seeing the poster was bad but the trailer was good, it looks interesting."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,I will say that this has so Imagination and Creativity but we will see when we cross that Purple Bridge.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Levi: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do a lot of thinking.‚Äù<br><br>‚Ä¶Makes sense. He said yes to this script.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-07,"This is a clear example of an ip that would have been better suited as an animated feature. If your live action movie needs like 98% CGI to work, just commit to full animation!"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-27,This movie gonna be a blockbuster üòé
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,"I was enamored with this book as a kid, I hope to god this does it justice"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,That was awesome!ü§©üíú I can‚Äôt wait!üòç I hope the mermaid from the cartoon appears in the movie!üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è She‚Äôs awesome!üòç
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-22,I haven&#39;t heard this old story since 5th grade. Never thought I see this character again
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,Zachary Levi loves playing adult characters with that childish personality. And this reminds me so much of Nickelodeon&#39;s Chalkzone.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,"I know of Purple Rain sung by Prince, the purple dress worn by Rapunzel, the purple tang, several cars that are purple, even some grapes are purple, Ariel&#39;s queen dress and several prom gowns as well as Black Panther&#39;s suit&#39;s fabric lines are purple. My mythical character, Megalo Station (Blaire Rastaneo) wears purple and plum; the darkest purple in the world and there&#39;s even Queen Emmaline (Hayley Atwell) with every light and dark purple."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-05-06,Shaka Laka Boom Boom üÉè‚úèÔ∏è <br>Good old days
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-15,In India This is &#39;Shaka Laka boom boom&#39;üòÇüòÇ
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,We makin out the bargain bin with this one üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-21,"aw this was my childhood book, I would always sing over &amp; over, ‚ÄúHarold &amp; the purple crayon‚Äù, love that Zooey is in it, and honored that my sister worked on assistant editing this film for 9 months ü´∂üèª"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,"Ngl, I kinda thought it would be alot cooler if this was 2D animated since it kinda makes me think about what Harold would look like if he was all grown up, but oh well, maybe giving this movie a watch shouldn&#39;t be too hard when I watch it online lol.<br><br>Tho&#39; also watching the HBO show of Harold and The Purple Crayon when I was a kid growing up did kinda make me inspire me to make a trio of magic crayon users kinda like Harold but with the same color as one of my favorite trios Huey,Dewey, and Louie as the magic crayons would be Red,Blue, and Green, best part is that I can even probably imagine my magic Red,Blue, and Green crayon user trio drawing Vehicles and Mechs tooüòÜ"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-06-07,"I still think I&#39;d rather have Zachary Levi wielding a frying pan than a purple crayon, but this does bring back a lot of childhood memories."
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,The things that got me interested in this movie : <br>1. Shaka-laka-boom-boom <br>2. Zoey Deschanel
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-24,Zachary Levi priorly voiced a rooster and Rapunzel&#39;s once-thief love. He even played Dave Seville&#39;s nephew. Alfred Molina priorly voiced Double Dan and played Otto Octavious and Maxim Horvath.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,He‚Äôs From DC‚Äôs Shazam Movie &amp; TV‚Äôs Chuck.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-27,Harold and the Purple Crayon is rated PG for mild action and thematic elements.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-16,Looks like one of those streaming movies
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,From the BR director of ICE AGE and RIO<br><br>In his live-action debut
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-23,"What I like about how the crayon works is that whatever he draws has some sort of purple on it<br><br>The plane has purple flames, buttons, and the smoke<br><br>The skateboard and the ramp are purple<br><br>The cart has purple lights<br><br>The propellers of the helicopter were purple<br><br>I think you get the idea"
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,This is the Closest thing we&#39;ll get to a Chalkzone movie.
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-04-16,My inner instinct thoughtsüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Harold and the Purple Crayon,2024-03-20,The third movie where Zachary Levi plays a child. At this point I think he&#39;s way too into it.
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"FYI: this is NOT a remake of the original movie, it is an adaptation of the tony award winning broadway musical version. the musical is much more closer to the book than the original movie. the musical is vastly different from the original so there is nothing to worry about. this movie will be its own thing. this new version and the original are two completely different movies. both can co-exist without diminishing the other. i think this movie will be amazing and i have no doubt in my mind that it will be a huge success"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"Whew. The way Fantasias voice came in, the eyes welled up and my goosebumps raised. She should have won a TONY for her portrayal and she better not get robbed for her Oscar."
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Fantasia having her full-circle moment! She totally deserves it! Love her!!
The Color Purple,2023-10-16,"The whole cast lineup is amazing, but tbh I&#39;m mainly excited to hear Fantasia sing again. I got emotional just hearing her sing in this trailer."
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"I pray that this opens the doors of super stardom for Fantasia. She deserves it, she&#39;s worked so hard and I want the best for her"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I never thought i would see Fantasia step back into this iconic role! I‚Äôm seeing this for this ensemble
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I‚Äôm over here freaking out.  I hope this movie gives my girl Fantasia all the praise and recognition she‚Äôs been so deserving of for so long.  Can‚Äôt wait.
The Color Purple,2024-02-18,Fantasia had me crying all through the film. She is a phenomenal singer and actress. Her voice seems a little deeper and  just as incredible as ever.  I love her so much. I pray she wins an Oscar. She so deserves it üôèüèΩ
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"Halle Bailey literally went from singing songs at home on YouTube with her sister, to starring in two of the biggest movies of the year. How incredible, what a gorgeous cast of black excellence. üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüëèüèæ"
The Color Purple,2023-05-25,"People were so worried about Halle playing Ariel... Meanwhile, she snuck an entire movie in without us even knowing! üòÇ I love you Halle! ‚ù§"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"God I hope they give Fantasia room to shine in this movie, she&#39;s got the potential to give an Oscar worthy performance here.  If this movie is as good as this trailer implies, I expect nothing short of perfection from her. She has the talent and the voice and  charisma to pull it off."
The Color Purple,2023-10-13,nothing can replace the original film. thinking of different parts of it could make me cry on the spot. i watch that movie and bawlllll and bawlllll damn i love that movie
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,If Fantasia don&#39;t sing!!! I remember when she performed this song at the Tony Awards. One of my favorites of hers ever ü§óüôèüèæ
The Color Purple,2023-05-25,"I was the Medic for this production.  Let me just say, I saw the day to day work.  Fantasia will surprise a lot of people.  Fantastic moment for her!"
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"As a fan of Fantasia, I‚Äôm soooooo damn Proud of her, everything she‚Äôs been through has lead her to this beautiful point‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so happy for her and just know this moment is going to change her life."
The Color Purple,2024-01-27,"Wow‚Ä¶that was THE best movie I‚Äôve seen. Period. Not usually a big fan of musicals, but the music in this was brilliant. I‚Äôm astonished that it hasn‚Äôt garnered more award nominations. And this isn‚Äôt a black thing: I‚Äôm a 64-year-old white Aussie and it was just the best thing I‚Äôve seen in years."
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Halle‚Äôs really showing us she‚Äôs not a one-trick pony. She‚Äôs not just a disney princess (which she embodies perfectly). C‚Äômon actress! Can‚Äôt wait to see this. So in love with the entire cast
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,This brought me to tears just seeing this. I can‚Äôt wait to see it on the big screen. This cast isn‚Äôt going to deliver nothing short of amazing. This is going to be epic. Tasia girl it‚Äôs your time love. I could feel all the emotions in each note sang.
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,I was lucky enough to see the Broadway production of The Color Purple in NYC starring Fantasia years ago. My Mom and I were in tears during Fantasia&#39;s solos. This is going to be great!!!
The Color Purple,2023-08-04,"I mean... Fantasia is just gold... She deserves the world, I feel like I&#39;ll cry like a baby on the theater"
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Who else is ready to see Fantasia shine?!
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Fantasia was born to play this role! I&#39;m so thrilled for her.
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"I saw Fantasia on Broadway in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;.  So glad she reprised the role for the movie musical version.  Her voice is magnificent. And I didn&#39;t know Taraji P. Henson could sing, she never sang on &quot;Empire&quot;.  Great choice for Suge Avery.   Looking forward to the movie.  üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
The Color Purple,2023-12-27,Saw this movie today. Didn‚Äôt even know Fantasia could act. This was a phenomenal take/musical. They did an outstanding job. I loved it so much.
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,From The Little Mermaid to a musical adaptation of The Colour Purple Halle Bailey is definitely on her way up to international stardom.
The Color Purple,2023-07-14,Just the trailer and I&#39;m crying already.
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"I saw Fantasia perform this role on Broadyway. Not a bootleg on YT. I was in the 6th row. CHILLS! Even if she doesn&#39;t sing, trust that she can play this role!"
The Color Purple,2023-12-26,"I just got home from watching this movie. Amazing, and I can&#39;t wait to see it again. Nice to see Fantasia in this. Always loved her singing."
The Color Purple,2023-06-10,"Taraji, Fantasia, Halle... some of my absolute faves in 1 project. Fingers crossed that it delivers as it should"
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,I have watched this trailer 10 times and I got goosebumps each time. Fantasia???? Her pipes have always been immaculate!!! Gorgeous and perfect casting!!! ‚ù§
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,I didn&#39;t even realize that was H.E.R! This cast is amazing and I cannot wait to see this! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s in theaters and not straight to streaming. This deserves a big screen!
The Color Purple,2023-12-27,"I just saw the movie Taraji Did Her Thing, she continues to show her versatility."
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"man, I did not expect this musical, of all things, to become a movie.<br>I think it&#39;s got a ton of potential, and I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re getting another musical movie this year."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,OMG. I am sobbing from this trailer. Fantasia&#39;s voice. One of my favorite stories and films.
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"&quot;The Color Purple&quot; is a true masterpiece in the making! This trailer has left me speechless and captivated by its powerful storytelling. The all-star cast, led by the incredible Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Colman Domingo, brings Alice Walker&#39;s beloved classic to life with such grace and authenticity. Kudos to director Blitz Bazawule for his bold vision and the remarkable team behind the scenes who have poured their hearts into this production. I&#39;m eagerly counting down the days until December 25th when I can experience the unbreakable bond of sisterhood and immerse myself in this reimagined world. Bravo, Warner Bros. Pictures, for bringing us this extraordinary film!"
The Color Purple,2023-12-23,"Fantasia&#39;s vocals just gives me, the chills. What a very anointing voice, she has. &amp;&amp; they have all the best actors and actresses, in this movie. I&#39;m so excited and I can&#39;t wait to see it!!"
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"Fantasia is such amazing singer. Like, really, she sings that fantastically. And already this movie is amazing.

The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I love H.E.R.! I would love to see her on Broadway!
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Taraji is going to KILL IT as Shug Avery! ‚ù§
The Color Purple,2023-09-16,Fantasia and Halle are the nation&#39;s best singers right now. They have the soulfulness of Whitney Houston. I&#39;m glad seeing Halle getting so much work and lighting up the screen with her divine presence. And Fantasia has been so underrated - she is The Voice. üëëüôèüèª‚ù§
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Fantasia? SAY LESS! so great to see her singing ON the big screen. Kudos to the production company and cast looks like a great movie
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I get that Halle is the lady of the moment (&amp; is heavily featured in the trailer) BUT Fantasia needs more love in this comment section for carrying the trailer with those stellar vocals!
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,Im here for both fantasia and Halle  ......especially Halle...I hope Halle goes all the way to the top in the film industry because she is a force to be reconed with

The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I saw Fantasia play this role here in Chicago. She didn&#39;t act it. She LIVED it. I am too excited!!!!!!!!!!
The Color Purple,2023-12-25,Tear Jerker.. great music.. great cast.. And a whole Lotta Amen.. it made me cry üò¢.. the harmonies at the end was emotional and I see you taraji üëãüëèüëèüëè

The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"Me being happy to see the musical and playing in it in high school and now seeing this version in theaters is one thing‚Ä¶..<br><br><br><br><br>But Spielberg, Oprah and Quincy producing it is another level."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I really thought this was a remake to the classic film but it&#39;s a musical and that&#39;s totally fine with me but I feel like Fantasia is going to killed it as Cecily and Oscars here we come! Cause I know this whole entire cast  will deliver a performance of a &quot;Lifetime&quot; üëè‚ù§üî•
The Color Purple,2024-12-17,Saw this movie today. I cried so much my heart hurts. Loved it so much.‚ù§
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,You had me at Fantasia! I love the other ladies also! I was blessed to see Fantasia in the Color Purple years ago at the Foxx Theater in Atlanta and she brought the house down!
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Fantasia&#39;s voice is definately top 10 - 20 all time. &amp; thats saying something given how many great singers there have been over the last century
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I&#39;m SO happy to see Halle in more movies ü´∂
The Color Purple,2023-12-05,Watched the screening last night and my heart was so full! I can&#39;t wait to see it again! Fantasia was beyond phenomenal! And Halle was so amazing in it!
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,Seeing Fantasia gives me proud mom feels! Ive been a fan since day one on Idol and I&#39;ve followed her every since. Can&#39;t wait to see her and some of the others get that Golden Globe recognition!

The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I saw a screening of this last fall and it‚Äôs INCREDIBLE and I can‚Äôt wait to see it again
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,"This trailer is just a work of art. Whoever edited it should be very proud. The 2 shots of shug (still and then dancing) followed by the cut to the quincy jones slide is so impactful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=71"">1:11</a>  As well as the faster raised hands sequence bouncing from the waterfall to the church then taraji henson slide. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> ‚ù§ <br><br>Also the bright sunny shot of halle dancing followed by an immediate cut to black ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=100"">1:40</a>"
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,"I just watched Oprah, Fantasia, Tarija, watching the trailer and It brought me to tears. I am so excited for Fantasia, she is so deserving! This is her full circle moment!! As soon as tics are available I&#39;m getting a ring side seat!!"
The Color Purple,2023-09-05,"Fantasia is one of only a few artists with a rich, distict voice that carries soul in every note."
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,I still remember Fantasia singing I‚Äôm Here at the Tonys back in the early 2000s. She was incredible then‚Ä¶it‚Äôs gonna be next level now.
The Color Purple,2023-05-25,Every once in a while I wonder what happened to Fantasia. My jaw dropped when I saw her! So happy to see her and I can&#39;t wait!
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"This is going to be a cinematic event! So much quality in the cast, footage and story. And it&#39;s coming out on Christmas. Theaters will be packed day 1"
The Color Purple,2023-10-24,"The original was a powerful and beautiful if not brutal movie, that I still remember to this day. I hope this movie does it justice üß°"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,This movie better sweep the Oscars next year! üíú
The Color Purple,2023-06-02,"And the Oscar goes to‚Ä¶ FANTASIA BARRINO! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I can already hear it. She better get her due. She has worked hard for so long and been through so much. This is the role of her career, and I hope they recognize it!"
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,This brought me to tears!!! I‚Äôve always wanted to see the musical and I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie. The cast looks phenomenal!! Can‚Äôt wait!!!
The Color Purple,2023-10-15,"Oh my goodness the trailer itself has me emotional. The original Color Purple movie is one of my favorite all time movies. I remember the 1st time I watched it at the age of 13 yrs old in 1998 I was at awe. I was 3 yrs old when the original movie came out.  I would make my PaPa sit and watch the original movie over and over again with me. I could tell he would get irritated with me. Lol! That is one of the great memories that I will always cherish that I had with my grandfather. So seeing that it comes out on Christmas my favorite and true holiday, I am going to be a emotional wreck sitting there in the movie theatre Christmas day God willing, just happy and crying tears of joy. Blessings, love, and hugs everyone. Be safe. üíú"
The Color Purple,2023-07-05,"I want to see it, but I&#39;m going to have a hard time trying not to compare every actor, scene, and choice in direction to the original. It was so memorable and stellar that the entire movie is solidified in my head."
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,"I have been a fan of Halle and her sister for several years. Their performance of the Star Spangled Banner showcased their skill and talent. If you haven&#39;t seen that, you must!! So happy for her!!"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Yes Halle I‚Äôm so proud of her
The Color Purple,2024-01-05,"I just came from seeing the movie and I loved it so much! I laughed, I cried; I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the music! Amazing! I foresee awards in the future."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,I‚Äôm at work screaming this is about to be GOOD!! Let‚Äôs go FANTASIA
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Halle Bailey is gonna shine in the movies! She is gonna be great in The Little Mermaid remake and she looks like she is gonna do great in this movie too!
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Fantasia gets me every time üò¢ My girl better rack up during the award season!!! Love seeing Danielle as Sophia!
The Color Purple,2023-08-10,Everytime I see this trailer it gives me chills. Especially when Halle says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre at the center of the universe‚Äù.
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,One just damn know well that this will not disappoint because it‚Äôs coming from the producers of BOTH the film and the musical!
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"i&#39;m crying right now. thank you. halle bailey, tariji,  and fantasia are going to be amazing in the film. i can already see it. fantasia better get nominated if nothing else."
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,Halle is such a great actress im so happy about the whole cast im ready now ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
The Color Purple,2023-12-26,"I saw this movie today, Christmas Day.<br>It is a fantastic movie, and i recommend seeing it."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,The Color Purple will be a must watch because of this phenomenal ensemble cast!
The Color Purple,2023-07-14,This movie is definitely going to send out a bright light of sunshine!!!! Things might get bad in the beginning but later on down the road get better especially when it&#39;s your time to shine bigger and brighter!!!! üíóüíï I&#39;m seeing this movie!!!!
The Color Purple,2023-05-24,"I can&#39;t wait. I&#39;m already crying. Love to Oprah, Steven S., Quincy Q, the whole cast. Much love to my girl, Fantasia. I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time to see Tasia on the big screen. I&#39;m in tears."
The Color Purple,2024-02-13,"If you get a chance to see this movie, it is dynamite. Taraji P, Danielle, Ciara, H.E.R, Fantasia, Holly, and all the cast were awesome, absolutely awesome.  I just watched it and to know what all those wonderful actresses went through to make this movie, made  my eyes about 5 times throughout the movie?<br>Gotta see it‚ù§"
The Color Purple,2023-05-23,"This is the first time I&#39;ve seen anything from the musical, I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about but the voice of Fantasia Barrino, which is so beautiful, the lyrics of the song, the cinematography so great, and seeing that the past is to be forgotten, made me cry, never I had cried over a trailer<br><br>i&#39;m so excited to see this"
The Color Purple,2023-06-13,Who else started crying as soon as Fantasia started singing? Can&#39;t wait to see her and Joe in concert!
The Color Purple,2023-07-14,I saw the first color purple in the movies and remember how long the lines were I left the theater crying it was so touching.
The Color Purple,2024-03-14,"Something special.... Bravo! ‚ù§ Thank you for the love put into it regardless of   the conflict over wages. They deserved everything they asked for fair wages, fair treatment, and a loyalty beyond measure."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"this is what I call a stellar cast, but I feel viola should be too. I am so looking forward to it.  I make a point of living the whole experience in theaters! üò≠‚ù§üáßüá∑"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"Voy a llorar, tengo tantas ganas de verla, por fin todo el mundo va a escuchar esa maravillosa canci√≥n cantada por fantas√≠a ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,This cast is excellent! The trailer got me sold immediately! I‚Äôm seated day one!!
The Color Purple,2024-01-14,I enjoyed this today 1/13/2014 by myself. Husband didn&#39;t want to go or anyone else. Just me &amp; GOD üôè üéâ‚ù§ 3HOURS OF ENJOYING THIS!
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"This is not a REMAKE of the original 1985 film, it‚Äôs an adaptation of the stage musical. Thought everyone should know. I‚Äôm actually interested in seeing this, it‚Äôs looks so good!!"
The Color Purple,2023-05-25,It&#39;s nice to see two Disney princesses in one film. Halle (Ariel) and H.E.R. (Belle)
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,Totally looking forward to this.  The Broadway musical was amazing!  And they have such an amazing cast.
The Color Purple,2023-12-09,"I saw a screening of the movie, it‚Äôs amazing. I loved it so much. The movie is so beautifully written and it made my cry multiple times. The crew is so talented and they are just amazing actors."
The Color Purple,2023-05-22,"Saw the Broadway show with Fantasia. I cannot wait to see the movie adaptation. I‚Äôm Here brings me to tears every time I hear Fantasia sing it. And go Halle. Not only is she making moves, she appears to be making the right moves"
The Substance,2024-09-19,This trailer doesn&#39;t do it any justice. You have no idea. It is one of the most insane movies I&#39;ve ever watched in my 32 years of living. Literally walked out of theater and sat down on a bench in the lobby for 15 minutes speechless.
The Substance,2024-08-15,The casting of Moore is genius!!! Given the intense online scrutiny she underwent recently regarding her cosmetic procedures. Love it.
The Substance,2024-08-18,So GLAD to see DEMI back on screen where she BELONGS!
The Substance,2024-08-15,"Saw it in Cannes, idk how they managed to keep secret the most impressive moments while make you want to (re)watch it. Brilliant marketing!"
The Substance,2024-09-15,"If you&#39;re fortunate enough to have already seen it at cannes or wherever,  please don&#39;t spoil it for us who haven&#39;t seen it yet!<br>It&#39;s very rare that a movie DOESN&#39;T  reveal its best elements and twists in the trailer.  Let&#39;s encourage that!"
The Substance,2024-08-15,She&#39;s perfect for this role. Just like in Black Swan when Wynona and Natalie have that spat. Art imitates life.
The Substance,2024-08-16,"I&#39;ve seen The Substance a few days ago here in Amsterdam, a month before its official release. I have seen thousands of (body) horror films and never ever seen anything like this. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are amazing. You are in for a ride."
The Substance,2024-08-15,"Finally a trailer that actually makes the movie look interesting<br>EDIT ohmyogosh 4.7 thousand likes, on my comment I am genuinely shocked! but ty"
The Substance,2024-08-20,"This is one of the best film trailers in a long while. Disturbing and unsettling from the first seconds. Wanted to go in blind, now want to see it even more!"
The Substance,2024-08-15,Dennis Quaid looks like an absolutely twisted delight in this lol.
The Substance,2024-08-15,"Believe me, it&#39;s INSANE"
The Substance,2024-08-19,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Demi!  You need stay  working with indie directors over the mainstream.  You wont be paid as well but you don&#39;t need the money and the parts will be so much better for you now!  You still have fans and this is the kind of thing that will make us go &quot;HOLY SHIT....Demi Moore was freaking AMAZING!&quot;
The Substance,2024-09-19,"I recently saw this movie and it is spectacular. Demi Moore is brilliant in it and Margaret Qualley also excellent. What I loved about the film were the deeper meanings and lessons within it. That as women (in particular) the &#39;younger version&#39; of ourselves beats up our older self for not being good enough. That we must maintain that youth or we are deemed unworthy, useless and on the scrap heap of life. There are some really poignant and moving moments in it where Elizabeth is told she is still beautiful, but her own self-hatred won&#39;t allow herself to believe it. This isn&#39;t just a gore fest, this is a perceptive film on aging, self-esteem, the way we punish ourselves as women and how society perceives the older woman. WATCH IT. You will not be disappointed. Oh, and by the way. Demi Moore deserves an Oscar for this film."
The Substance,2024-09-14,Saw it yesterday. Was so hyped for this movie and boy did it not disappoint! My jaw dropped at one point. Was kind of lost for words after the film ended and my other friend said to me he was thinking throughout the movie ‚Äúwtf am I watching‚Äù. Definitely go see it at the movies!
The Substance,2024-08-15,"This, my dear trailer makers of today, is how a trailer is made."
The Substance,2024-08-26,"God, if this doesn&#39;t finally get demi moore an oscar nomination, I don&#39;t know what will ??"
The Substance,2024-08-15,"There should be 2 separate screening options: 1 - respectful viewing, 2 - one that let&#39;s me scream because of how shook I am. Of all the movies released this year, this is the one I&#39;m most excited for."
The Substance,2024-08-17,God I love Demi Moore.  Glad she is back.
The Substance,2024-08-15,Watched it. Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt ready.
The Substance,2024-08-20,"Demi is 61 and looks amazing! I don‚Äôt give a damn what she‚Äôs done, whatever it is, it‚Äôs working."
The Substance,2024-08-16,"Demi Moore is going to win an Oscar for this, I intuit."
The Substance,2024-08-18,"Seeing Dennis Quaid eat almost made me lose my appetite for years! Can&#39;t wait for the movie! Coralie Fargeat is one filmmaker to watch. After seeing &quot;Revenge,&quot; I will watch whatever she does!"
The Substance,2024-08-18,This is like Black Swan/Perfect Blue meets Cronenberg in his prime meets a sprinkle of Limitless and I&#39;m HERE FOR IT!!!
The Substance,2024-08-15,I love Demi Moore‚Äôs film work and can‚Äôt wait to see it!
The Substance,2024-08-28,I wanna see just cuz it&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve seen Demi Moore on the big screen. She&#39;s amazing
The Substance,2024-08-15,Demi Moore screaming holy shit
The Substance,2024-08-22,I love love love Demi Moore! Brilliant actress and human being. She absolutely needs to be in more movies to shine for us.
The Substance,2024-08-15,Quite possibly one of the best trailers I have seen in a long time and a long side that we have Demi Moore one of hollywoods finest actresses making a comeback so darn spectacular there are already major whispers of oscar nominations. I am already going to see this as many times as humanly possible.    This looks like cinema to me.   Hallelujah something original
The Substance,2024-08-17,"Welcome back to the outstanding Demi Moore, actress extraordinaire. How you have been missed by movie aficionados around the world."
The Substance,2024-08-15,"Saw it yesterday in Amsterdam, absolutely enjoyed it, some sort of a masterpiece when you enjoy the genre."
The Substance,2024-08-15,Demi Moore is going to slay this role. üíÖ
The Substance,2024-08-16,"Watched this at a film festival - maybe one of the best films I‚Äôve ever seen. Must see in a cinema, ridiculously fun experience"
The Substance,2024-08-15,"Sure, we&#39;re living in pretty hellish times, but cinema is giving me LIFE. So many good films to look forward to, with this + Anora at the top of the list"
The Substance,2024-08-15,It‚Äôs incredible. Get ready folks!
Immaculate,2024-03-05,I give Sydney Sweeney credit for this big move.  She auditioned for this film in 2014 and the film never got made.  So years later she used her new star power to get it made.  That is huge.
Immaculate,2024-01-25,she will never know a day unemployed
Immaculate,2024-01-25,The Anyone But You/The Nun crossover we all demanded.
Immaculate,2024-01-27,I don&#39;t know the belittling in the comments for Sydney. She is a young good actress finding her scope of work while also not narrowing her choices so directors can see she can  deliver other than looks
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Sydney Sweeney is everywhere and I‚Äôm not complaining. Queeeeen! Can‚Äôt wait to see this.
Immaculate,2024-01-26,"This normally wouldn‚Äôt be my type of movie but she‚Äôs so good in everything, I can‚Äôt wait to see it"
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Sydney Sweeney as a nun lmao
Immaculate,2024-01-25,I see Sydney Sweeney I watch
Immaculate,2024-01-25,"this looks like it could actually be really good, but they need to tone down the jump scares"
Immaculate,2024-01-28,"with a voice , face her like  . she will be in thousands of movies ."
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Sister Rosemary&#39;s Baby
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Her literally being mother ‚Ä¶
Immaculate,2024-01-25,I like that they‚Äôre doubling down on her two biggest talents
Immaculate,2024-01-25,"This, to me, seems like a weird spin on either The Omen or Rosemary‚Äôs Baby"
Immaculate,2024-01-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MACU-2pqVOI&amp;t=43"">0:43</a>  professor ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Immaculate,2024-01-26,I‚Äôm tired of jumpscare horror can we just get inspiration from A24 movies style.. thats a kind of horror we need in this generation
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Oh Yeah! I&#39;ll be in a theater seat on March 22.
Immaculate,2024-01-25,i think this will cover up all the jumpscares in the whole movie
Immaculate,2024-01-25,Jump scares are not horror. They never will be.
Immaculate,2024-01-26,"as a man of culture,  I will be supporting this movie."
Immaculate,2024-01-26,Count me in!

Immaculate,2024-01-29,"I can already predict the Letterboxd reviews saying, &quot;Sydney Sweeney was immaculate, but this movie was not&quot;. Also, how many people will mix this up with The First Omen?"
Immaculate,2024-01-26,sydney swOOney
Immaculate,2024-01-25,I will be watching this for 2 very big reasons.
Immaculate,2024-01-26,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MACU-2pqVOI&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> amazing trailer"

Immaculate,2024-01-26,Nothing but jump scare tropes accompanied by a ‚ÄúBOOM‚Äù sound effect. I‚Äôm happy for the dumb people that will enjoy this movie.

Borderlands,2024-02-22,"You know a trailer is bad, when you love every single actor in it and all you can think is &quot;Not a single one of these people are correctly cast.&quot;"
Borderlands,2024-04-28,The most entertaining part of this whole trailer is the comment section.
Borderlands,2024-02-21,This trailer makes Borderlands look like a family road trip movie.
Borderlands,2024-02-21,The most random ensemble cast ever lol üòÇ
Borderlands,2024-07-17,Jumanji 4: Guardians of the Borderlands
Borderlands,2024-02-22,"By the looks of it, they literally got the world, the guns, the creatures, heck, even claptraps design on point, but when it came down to the characters they were just like &quot;Find me the most &#39;how do you do fellow teens&#39; actors imaginable for these iconic character roles..."
Borderlands,2024-02-22,This movie feels like a strange fever dream
Borderlands,2024-02-21,"All this trailer tells me is that it&#39;s gonna end with &quot;We may have not found the vault, but we found friends along the way&quot;"
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Literally Kevin hart just doing his Dwayne Johnson impression the whole time
Borderlands,2024-02-27,Hollywood: &quot;How do you do fellow gamers?&quot;
Borderlands,2024-02-22,This movie looks like it&#39;s trying to be a Borderlands parody rather than an actual adaptation
Borderlands,2024-08-08,"&quot;God, I hate this planet&quot; (Grumpy old grandma noises)<br>And they used it twice in this video!"
Borderlands,2024-02-23,The fact they didn‚Äôt have Marcus narrate the trailer and introduce the characters tells me all I need to know
Borderlands,2024-08-08,Casting Kevin Hart for the role of Roland is like casting Danny DeVito for the role of Iron Man.
Borderlands,2024-02-22,"Me: <b>*No worries*</b><br>Trailer: <b>*From the producers of Uncharted, Spider-Man, and Venom*</b><br>Me: <b>*One worry*</b>"
Borderlands,2024-02-22,&quot;I&#39;ve never played the game but someone told me about it&quot; the movie
Borderlands,2024-02-21,"Spaceballs predicted this: &quot;You idiots, you captured their stunt doubles!&quot;"
Borderlands,2024-05-08,A Borderlands trailer without ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no rest for the wicked‚Äù is borderline criminal.
Borderlands,2024-02-28,I really didnt realize that borderlands turned into a senior living facility ‚ò†üíÄ
Borderlands,2024-07-25,"This movie is like an undiscovered treasure. I say, let&#39;s bury it even deeper."
Borderlands,2024-02-28,&quot;How many poor casting decisions do you want in this film?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Man imagine Idris Elba playing Roland...
Borderlands,2024-02-21,i can already guess the post credit scene<br><br>&quot;hey whats your name?&quot;<br>&quot;My name&#39;s jack&quot;<br>&quot;You look pretty handsome yknow&quot;
Borderlands,2024-04-01,This movie had better come with a disclaimer: &quot;Possibly inspired by a screenshot of a Borderlands game&quot;
Borderlands,2024-07-20,Love that the median age of a vault hunter is 49 in this trailer.
Borderlands,2024-02-21,"if we had marcus asking us if we wanted to hear another story at the start of this i would‚Äôve been 10000x more satisfied, just saying."
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Superb work. You can really tell the production team glanced at the Borderlands Wikipedia page.
Borderlands,2024-02-22,How did I never realize Roland was 4&#39;11&quot; with a high pitched voice?
Borderlands,2024-04-23,It looks like its Dwayne Johnson away from being Jumanji 3.
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Introducing Kevin Hart as Kevin Hart but in Borderlands
Borderlands,2024-02-22,Kevin Hart as Roland?!?!  Who was in charge of that casting?!?!
Borderlands,2024-06-02,‚ÄúHow much like Guardians of the Galaxy do you want this trailer to look like‚Äù?<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù
Borderlands,2024-02-24,to quote Sir Hammerlock: I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one
Borderlands,2024-07-27,Writers source: &quot;Trust me bro&quot;
Borderlands,2024-02-24,My house burnt down recently and watching this was still the saddest part of my month
Borderlands,2024-02-21,They should have cast no names that actually matched the vibes of the vault hunters
Borderlands,2024-06-09,i haven&#39;t even bought a ticket and i already want my money back.
Borderlands,2024-02-22,&quot;I asked A.I to make me a James Gunn movie based on Borderlands&quot; ahhh movie
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Why&#39;d they forget the actor that portrayed Krieg lol
Borderlands,2024-02-22,I didn&#39;t realize the borderlands turned into a senior living facility
Borderlands,2024-02-22,How are they not gonna use Ain‚Äôt No Rest for the Wicked as the trailer song
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Is Kevin Hart supposed to be Roland? Because he has the height of Salvador üòÇ
Borderlands,2024-02-21,"big &quot;errrm he&#39;s behind me, isnt he&quot;  energy"

Borderlands,2024-02-23,The comment section is the best thing about this trailer.
Borderlands,2024-04-16,‚ÄúWhat are we? Some kinda borderlands?‚Äù
Borderlands,2024-07-14,Could‚Äôve at least used the real claptrap voice lol
Borderlands,2024-04-25,"So, you cast a 65yo woman to play a 30 year old. You cast a 54 year old to play a 27 year old. You cast a 16 year old to play an 8 year old. You cast a short comedian to be a serious 6foot dude. Kreig is like 30 years too early. I have a feeling this isn&#39;t going to go down well with the true BL fans"

Borderlands,2024-02-21,"As a fan of the game since 2009, I probably would have done everything completely differently."
Borderlands,2024-02-21,missed ops: Marcus start &quot;So you want to hear a story huh&quot;- so many missed opportunities
Borderlands,2024-03-01,&quot;Roland doesn&#39;t talk like that.&quot;<br><br>Mordecai&#39;s words not mine.
Borderlands,2024-02-21,"Remember, these are the best parts of the movie."
Borderlands,2024-02-23,This is like someone told an Ai to make a Borderlands movie for people who like the Cheesecake Factory.
Borderlands,2024-04-22,"Ah yes, all the coolest, youngest, most relevant actors who have definitely heard of Borderlands."
Borderlands,2024-02-27,"Who in their right mind thought that Kevin Hart was a good idea to play Roland?  &quot;Yeah, we have a mostly serious no-nonsense soldier character, let&#39;s get a comedian to play him!&quot;"
Borderlands,2024-06-20,"This feels like all the actors are cosplaying instead of playing the actual character. Also, why this cast of characters?"
Borderlands,2024-06-07,Borderlands deserves a show with a proper cast
Borderlands,2024-07-22,"Marcus: &quot;So you want to hear another story?&quot;<br>Fans, after watching the trailer: &quot;No.&quot;"
Borderlands,2024-02-21,So Roland is like 6 Feet tall and a very serious character. So the casting director thought it would be a great idea to cast a pint size comedian? The casting in this flick is completely jacked.

Borderlands,2024-06-07,Hollywood:  Why do our movies fail?  Borderlands: Senior actor&#39;s retirement home
Borderlands,2024-02-21,this was a golden opportunity to play &quot;Aint no rest for the wicked&quot; by Cage the Elephant. It would had been way more better if someone that made the trailer played any of the borderland games.
Borderlands,2024-06-22,Remember when we got them to remake Sonic? Can we do that again here?
Borderlands,2024-07-18,Hollywood respect the source material challenge: impossible
Borderlands,2024-02-21,Kevin hart playing roland makes me think no one making this movie actually played the game.
Borderlands,2024-03-08,&quot;We&#39;ve F*cking Given Up on Casting: The Movie&quot;
Borderlands,2024-02-23,"I never really got into Borderlands myself,  but I know enough about it to see this movie is made by people who know nothing about it."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"it‚Äôs just so impressive how mia goth plays maxine, pearl, and old pearl. truly a legend. SHE is THE hollywood star."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"I love how all three films are so dissimilar in tone, and seemingly incredible on their own. This looks like this could be my favorite of the series."
MaXXXine,2024-04-11,"It&#39;s so insane how this, Pearl, and X are part of the same trilogy and share the same characters and yet they&#39;re so distinct from each other. X feels like a 70s exploitation film a la Texas Chainsaw, Pearl feels like an early technicolor a la Wizard of Oz, and this feels like a glossy dramatic thriller a la Showgirls. God I really hope they stick the landing with this one, it looks so good."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"Girl, I‚Äôve been ready since X."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"I&#39;ll never get over how GOOD these movies look. They just feel authentic to the film styles of time periods they take place in, but not without a little modern twist to keep them fresh. There&#39;s a lot of love and care put into making them feel authentic and not clean and digital."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,She‚Äôs an icon. She‚Äôs a legend. She is the moment.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,A quality trilogy within 5 years. Thank you A24.
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,The swiftness in which they cranked this trilogy out must be studied. I can 1000000% say this movie is gonna be amazing and the fact that there‚Äôs no drop in quality is awesome. Mia Goth is GREAT!
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,Mia Goth is slaying as our current Scream Queen.  Love the 80&#39;s nostalgia/feel in this trailer.
MaXXXine,2024-04-13,She is a hell of an actress <br>And A24 has been killing it
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,I don&#39;t understand why that final monologue in Pearl didn&#39;t get Mia at least a nomination for an oscar.
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,"‚ÄúWhatever is going on in your life that‚Äôs interfering with this picture, squash it.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI intend to.‚Äù<br>Epic."
MaXXXine,2024-04-23,This trailer alone is better than some entire movies out there.
MaXXXine,2024-05-27,"I just thought of something. Maxine&#39;s blonde hair could be a reference to the judges rejecting Pearl because they needed someone more blonde, more American for the stage."
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0uS3t6nFgY&amp;t=63"">1:03</a> the music, the shot, the fog,the walk, the sound of the heels,mia goth, I mean come on this part is iconic."
MaXXXine,2024-06-04,looks like Ti West has outdone himself this looks like it has the makings of a forever classic. CAN NOT WAIT!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Pearl was so good. &quot;Imma STAR!&quot;
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"The Night Stalker was a real serial killer in 1984-1985 btw. He was interested in Satanism and drew pentagrams on the walls, his hand, and one of his victims. He killed and tortured people in a lot of different ways and was on death row before dying of cancer in 2013. Really curious to see if and how this will relate to Maxxxine. Very excited for this movie"
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,OMG she sees pearl again in the window! Just like the scene in X when she saw pearl at the door
MaXXXine,2024-04-20,"Her lamenting after not being able to land the role in pearl is actually one of the most powerful performance in recent memory, you need to watch it to experience it."
MaXXXine,2024-04-13,The soundtrack alone makes me want to watch it
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,The fact that they used bits of &quot;Self control&quot; by Laura Branigan makes me so happy. LOVE THAT SONG!
MaXXXine,2024-06-01,Why can some women look amazing in every hair color üò≠
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,I&#39;m so glad how much it feels like a genuine 80s slasher.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,SHES FINALLY HEREE
MaXXXine,2024-04-11,"They way she played young Pearl,old Pearl and Maxine,seamlessly show how talented Mia Goth is. This trilogy is so original. I&#39;m here for it."
MaXXXine,2024-04-11,Mia goth just puts out all the stops when it comes to her acting. She oozes talent not to mention she‚Äôs effortlessly gorgeous
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"Im just glad West is finally getting the credit he deserves. The mans been putting out some of the best horror movies for over a decade, yet I feel like im always showing them to people for the first time."
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,"I loved Pearl and X, now it&#39;s her moment, Maxxxine Minx. She is a STAAAAARRRRR!"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"if you&#39;re curious about the music:<br>animotion - obsession<br>laura branigan - self control<br><br>edit:  animotion - obsession... NOT fashion, my brain farted. <br>if you were a Canadian kid watching cbc Newsworld in the 90s you&#39;d understand where my brain went ."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"Girl, I‚Äôve been ready since X."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,I liked X a lot and Pearl was AMAZING so I‚Äôm very excited for this. I like the 80s/retro aesthetic I think it works so well with slasher type movies. I‚Äôm also glad that it‚Äôs actually continuing the story from X with the private investigator tracking her down because I wasn‚Äôt sure how they were gonna continue that story seeing how X ended.
MaXXXine,2024-06-01,"The first song is Obsession by Animotion which is a banger and the 2nd song that plays is Self Control by Laura Branigan, and is also a banger!!!!"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"I love how logo A24 is styled to Hollywood sign, it‚Äôs just fabulous"
MaXXXine,2024-04-29,"Mia&#39;s acting was just so outstanding in Pearl. The instant changes in facial expressions based on situation, not forgetting the the vibe she gave out of a naive girl who seems to be 99% (without overacting), she just delivered it at its best."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Mia Goth is straight up incredible and deserved an Oscar nomination for her role in Pearl. This looks to be just as amazing!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"I&#39;m a simple man, I see A24 I click."
MaXXXine,2024-04-22,This is one of those trailers that I can&#39;t stop watching
MaXXXine,2024-04-11,I love X and Pearl.  Can&#39;t wait for this.
MaXXXine,2024-07-04,This soundtrack will be 10/10!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Shes still got that X factor! Who else instantly noticed jenna/lorraine‚Äôs scream from X in the police evidence tape??üòÑüòÑüòÑ
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"Please,  make sure this is released simultaneously in Brazil ! Mia Goth is a legend here."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,What I love about this trilogy is that every film has its own unique energy.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Anything with a 70&#39;s/80&#39;s look i&#39;m here for it!! those were the best days
MaXXXine,2024-04-14,Whoever cut this trailer is a genius!
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0uS3t6nFgY&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> the jenna scream is amazing"
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,"Very Giallo-esque. I like how X had a Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe, Pearl was like a technicolored nightmare,which bleeds into Maxxxine, which appears to be influenced by a sub-genre of horror, Giallo, that&#39;s known for bright shiny blood and Technicolor. This looks outstanding. And I&#39;m holding out hope for an unexpected 4th film!!"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"God I can&#39;t wait to see this sequel, the aesthetic of the 80s, the music and the world of fame in Hollywood makes it look perfect. I hope Maxine achieves her dream of being a famous actress and doesn&#39;t end up like poor Pearl."
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,This has gotta be the single biggest blow up of an indie movie I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime. How do you go from X to having a cast and marketing like this in 2024? Blown away
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0uS3t6nFgY&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> I was already sold, but that 0.1 second shot of Lily Collins has me over the moon. What a stacked cast."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,This was a well done trailer. Showed a lot but without actually revealing anything. They&#39;ve captured the 80&#39;s feel perfectly &amp; I love the use of Universal Studios as a setting. Add a bit of Laura Branigan with one of my favourite songs of the 80&#39;s playing over the trailer &amp; üëå perfection.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,MAXXXINE THE FINAL GIRL üòçüòçüíÖ
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,"There&#39;s something truly remarkable about the way these movies look. They transport you back in time while adding a modern flair to keep things interesting. You can feel the love and attention to detail that went into creating them. It&#39;s like stepping into a time machine and experiencing the past with a fresh perspective. You can almost smell the nostalgia seeping through the screen, reminding you of a simpler time when things weren&#39;t so polished and perfect. It&#39;s a testament to the artistry and dedication of those behind the scenes who strive to keep the authenticity alive in a world of sleek digital perfection <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a>"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,IT FEELS LIKE WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR AN ETERNITY!! ANOTHER MASTERPIECE INCOMING!
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,You had me at Giancarlo Esposito.
MaXXXine,2024-04-10,I love the way she said &quot;Maxxxine fuckin&#39; Minx!&quot;<br>She&#39;s fuckin&#39; great!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,They already appear to be making the most of the music! Love those 80&#39;s hits!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,THE BATES MOTEL üòç
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,&quot;X Part 3&quot; is one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Mia Goth is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"With &#39;X&#39; and especially &#39;Pearl&#39; Ti West and Mia Goth are a legendary pairing. If this turns out as good as the first two, this will be the best modern day horror trilogy. Period."
MaXXXine,2024-04-14,its crazy how different mia looks with just a change of hair and makeup
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"Mia Goth and TI West has the potential to have multiple collaborations like Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese in the slasher horror genre and if that happens in the future, that&#39;d be freaking awesome"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,‚ÄúSelf Control‚Äù by Laura Brannigan <b>IS</b> my eighties jam!!
MaXXXine,2024-04-11,"80s background music,<br>Loved it‚ù§"
MaXXXine,2024-07-02,Pearl: PLEASE IM A STARRRR<br>maxine: IM A F*****g STAR THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING TO KNOW MY NAME<br>maXXXing: The whole world knows her name
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"jenna&#39;s scream at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0uS3t6nFgY&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> tho"
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,You don&#39;t know how happy I am to see a well-lit movie these days
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,The trilogy is officially complete! A24 will forever be the greatest and most respected studio of the 2020s!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,I couldn&#39;t imagine anyone else in this role except Mia Goth.
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,"I have so much respect for Ti West and the entire crews that worked on the movies. They almost came from nowhere with so much talent and a balance between hommage and identity, with freshness, well-written characters without dwelling on endless over used tropes‚Ä¶"
MaXXXine,2024-04-15,"Night Stalker, Bates Motel, AND X!? This is gonna be crazy!"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Wow. Ti West officially has outdone himself. Instantly one of my all-time favorite trailers. Blown away.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,OH MY GOD THE PERFECT TRILOGY IS COMING!!!!!!!!!!!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,I‚Äôm seated. The theater employees are scared and asking me to leave because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot July yet‚Äù but I‚Äôm simply too seated.
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,"the diva is back and shining even brighter, eager to see this star shine once again"
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,Mia Goth is pure talent.  Her performance in Pearl was Oscar worthy on her big monologue scene alone.  This is going to go down as one of the greatest horror trilogies of all time!!!
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,The way they cut the music into this trailer is fantastic and a masterclass on how it should be done.
MaXXXine,2024-04-09,"X, Pearl and Maxxxine... Mia Goth Rocks..."
MaXXXine,2024-04-14,"I hope the 80&#39;s come back in fashion, been waiting 40 years..."
MaXXXine,2024-04-08,no way IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS TO COME OUT

Homestead,2024-11-17,Neal is another underrated actor and I swear has been in everything since the 90s and hasn&#39;t aged a day
Homestead,2024-12-10,I met Neal once as a cashier at an LA grocery store. He and his family helped bag and had the friendliest most delightful energy of any celebrity I&#39;ve met.
Homestead,2024-11-16,Neal McDonough looks perfect for this role. Will definitely watch.
Homestead,2024-12-08,"Neal portrayed my father in Clint Eastwood&#39;s &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;....the story of the men on Iwo Jima who raised the flag..photo became iconic. My father was not one of the men who raised the flag, rather the commander of E-company and gave the order that they hike up to Mt. Surabachi and put up the flag. Neal phoned my father to interview him as he wanted to portray him in the best way possible. I also admire Neal&#39;s  moral stance when choosing roles he will take...have appreciated the other films/tv productions where his talents are evident. (Lynn Severance)"
Homestead,2024-11-16,I love the idea of a survival movie like this.
Homestead,2024-11-16,If you advertise that you are prepared the government will come and take what you have.
Homestead,2024-12-18,"Looks like an awesome an eye-opening movie. It reminds me we are living in some serious times and we need be preparing ourselves with Word to be able to withstand the things that are coming. Being emergency prepared and having sustainable sources of food etc is important, but without  God we cannot make it; that is true preparation."
Homestead,2024-11-16,Congrats to the actors and creators! This looks amazing!
Homestead,2024-11-15,Angel Studios delivers again-spectacularly.
Homestead,2024-12-16,I love when a movie about the end of the world includes a song where they sing ‚Äúit‚Äôs the end of the world!‚Äù
Homestead,2024-12-10,"The John Goodman quote from 10 Cloverfield lane certainly would apply here: People thought he was crazy, but crazy is building your ark when the flood has already started."
Homestead,2024-11-16,"neil McDonough  was an absolute beast in Yellowstone.  Such a great actor, should be good!"
Homestead,2024-11-15,One of the most exciting Angel trailers yet!
Homestead,2024-11-16,"This movie literally looks like it was taken from a book series called Black Autumn. You have a financial guy who happens to be mormon and owns a homestead in Salt Lake City. He hires a friend who was a Green Baret and then enlistes a bunch of former military operators and former Afghan commandos that fled Afghanistan. They have to figure out how to live without any idea what&#39;s going on in the outside world. They have to fight back gangs and cartel members. On top of starving people, they end up calling zombies. They also have diseases getting contracted. It‚Äôs a really good series that doesn‚Äôt solely focus on the homestead but people navigating the world after the fall of the country, including the sitting president who starts of kinda tame but goes out like a badass"
Homestead,2024-12-18,Neal McDonough is finally getting the recognition is solely deserves. He&#39;s going to steal the show in this movie. I just know it. I never even heard of this movie until today and I&#39;m only watching it because of him.
Homestead,2024-11-15,I absolutely love homesteading! Pumped for this movie!
Homestead,2024-12-15,"Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.‚Äù<br>Luke 21:28  nkjv"
Homestead,2024-12-13,"The offer is generous and will be an amazing assist to those who have purchased their land or are in a position to do so now. This is one of those times when someone was working towards the dream and all the best drops into their laps because they had WORKED at preparing for this. As for me, my family just got off the farm."
Homestead,2024-11-15,Take my money now. I HAVE to see this!
Homestead,2024-11-15,Yes!!! I‚Äôve been looking forward to this movie for months!
Homestead,2024-12-16,This concept has been done before but I&#39;m still gonna watch it.
Homestead,2024-11-16,I&#39;ll watch anything that has Neal McDonough in it!
Homestead,2024-11-18,This movie looks so much better than this year‚Äôs movie ‚ÄúCivil War.‚Äù
Homestead,2024-11-21,This actually looks more nuanced than I expected.
Homestead,2024-11-15,I feel an LA vs Utah vibe in the scenery :)
Homestead,2024-11-16,"Should have been a series to be honest. There a lot of content and the books can provide enough even for a full classic 7 season, 23 episode format."
Homestead,2024-11-18,We will go as a family to see this in Canada. We love what Angel studios has been putting out.
Homestead,2024-11-16,I bet my late father would love this film because he was big on films and books about atomic holocaust and survival.
Homestead,2024-12-15,"Did anybody get the weird feeling that for the sweepstakes at the end, you&#39;d be put on a government list?? Lol"
Homestead,2024-11-20,Best apocalyptic content I&#39;ve seen since Jericho.
Homestead,2024-12-08,Kinda wish this was a show so I can enjoy it longer. Can‚Äôt wait!
Homestead,2024-11-25,"As hard as it may be or as &quot;hateful&quot; as it may seem, you just cannot open yourself up to everyone in a situation like this. When resources are limited you cannot simply say &quot;come on in, we&#39;ll do what we can&quot; for everyone. It sounds terrible and would be very hard, but it&#39;s a very simple fact. This looks like it may be a pretty good movie, I really like Neal McDonough."
Homestead,2024-11-20,I was an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù in this film so they let me come and be an extra in the filming. It was pretty cool to be a part of it. It‚Äôs gonna be a great movie followed by a series!
Homestead,2024-12-08,I love knowing everything going on in the movie before watching it
Homestead,2024-11-22,"Excited for this, just stumbled across this trailer today. Looks exciting and also very timely."
Homestead,2024-11-20,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XURLw2XXHWA&amp;t=12"">0:12</a> . I had a dream that looked almost exactly like this shot of the trailer. Myself and 2  others were walking on a highway over pass. I did not know these 2 strangers,suddenly, I heard showfar horns or aka judgment/rapture horns. A couple of seconds passed, and 3 nuclear explosions on each side of the overpass many miles away just erupted nearly simultaneously. These nuclear bombs looked like footage of the Hiroshima nuke drop but larger, and instead of an orange fiery color, they were glowing blood red. I fell down at the sight of the explosions and, for some reason,I couldn&#39;t get back up. The stranger behind me retreated from the way we came,the stranger in front of me ran away, leaving me behind. I told him to wait for me, and he yelled back. no.I yelled back, &quot;Stay safe&quot;. I was able to get back up and move forward. For some reason, I felt safe and protected even though I was caught in nuclear cross fire.Downhill was a highway rest area where truckers and people alike can rest and recouperate on long trips. I saw the picnic area and sat on a picnic table bench. By this time, the sky started to turn to this orange reddish colour due to the explosions. I just sat there thinking about what just happened. Suddenly, I started crying and yelling &quot;I missed the rapture&quot; over and over again while sobbing.This is a warning that the return of Jesus is near. Accept Jesus Christ as lord and savior and repent of your sins and follow the 10 commandmandments. Amen"
Homestead,2024-11-15,ü§Ø This looks amazing.
Homestead,2024-12-19,"I used to be fearful of this kind of scenario, and was in full &quot;prepper mode&quot;.   I have peace now that I am walking with Jesus, and I know its all in His hands.  The Bible says 365 times do NOT be afraid.  Now I walk by faith!"
Homestead,2024-12-17,We got our tickets and can&#39;t wait to see this!
Homestead,2024-11-17,This is gonna be a great Christmas family movie
Homestead,2024-11-18,&quot;America&#39;s just been attacked. They blew up a barn.&quot;
Homestead,2024-11-15,This trailer is üî•. So excited for this!! That giveaway is epic
Homestead,2024-12-10,"If you want to know what&#39;s getting ready to happen in the near future,  this is the movie to watch! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23getready"">#getready</a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wariscoming"">#wariscoming</a>!"
Homestead,2024-12-17,All Christians &amp; Prepper/Survivalist need to go &amp; support this. Just cause DJT was elected doesn‚Äôt mean you go to sleep
Homestead,2024-11-16,Cant wait to watch it and the series that will come after also!
Homestead,2024-12-10,This looks great. Neil McDonough is fantastic.
Homestead,2024-11-16,Excited to see the Movie! Even more excited about the series! I think a story like this really needs the long form to develop and unravel. Any dates on the TV Show?
Homestead,2024-12-05,This movie looks sweet it looks at helluva lot better than Civil War
Homestead,2024-12-14,Movies like this are a study guide for the future.  It&#39;s coming.
Homestead,2024-12-08,Loved Neal McDonough in arrow and Tulsa king
Homestead,2024-12-08,Finally something worth watching. I Can‚Äôt wait!
Homestead,2024-11-15,OH MY WORD THIS WILL BE EPIC!!!!!
Homestead,2024-12-12,movie looks great cant wait to see it
Homestead,2024-11-15,This movie looks like it&#39;ll be the BOMB üí£
Homestead,2024-12-19,this looks so awesome. a couple few actors I have seen before and I admire their work. No doubt I will see this in the closest theatre I can find it in
Homestead,2024-11-16,"Cool, been waiting to see Homestead  for ages. Can&#39;t wait."
Homestead,2024-12-02,"Quiet realistic, if America breaks out a crisis like this, the scenario could be the same as the movie."
Homestead,2024-12-10,See this is what I thought movies like Leave the world behind and Civil War would be like. This looks good and I will gladly support it.
Homestead,2024-12-08,Looks like a spectacular film that you guys all put together but it reminds me of the film Left Behind with prepper supplies added into it! But at least you got a couple good actors! That&#39;s a plus! üëçüèªüòéüíØ
Homestead,2024-11-15,Angel Stuios sure knows its audience lol
Homestead,2024-12-09,Just in time for Christmas.

Homestead,2024-12-09,Thank You for Trying to Reach Them üíõüíú
Homestead,2024-12-18,"From the people who brought us Sound Of Freedom. Great, I‚Äôm in"
Homestead,2024-12-05,Why do movies like this that ACTUALLY look good not have commercials everywhere and I didn‚Äôt hear about it until just today
Homestead,2024-11-15,Soooo excited for this one!
Homestead,2024-11-15,I want to see it<br>Looks awesome
Homestead,2024-12-18,"Gonna make this unneeded point: As the owner of a property or your own home, YOU choose who gets to come in and out. Nobody else gets that permission or privelege to do so. YOU are the King of your own Castle, and whoever tries to violate that natural and sacred private right has no right to complain about any form of retribution enacted upon them for violating someone else&#39;s sanctity and peace of mind. <br>This movie is just an extremely upscaled version of a &quot;what if&quot; scenario based upon that rule. There&#39;s a whole reason why Americans are afforded the &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; in defense of themself, their property, and their peace."
Homestead,2024-12-08,Will definitely watch this on theatres
Homestead,2024-12-11,Great cast. Looking forward to this. All three main actors/actress in this have been amazing in all their other roles. They&#39;ve either been screwed over by Hollywood or just shadowed by too big of a name in the show/movie they were in. Which sucks. Glad they get to shine here.
Homestead,2024-11-17,The irony in all these films the apocalypse takes everything away from from them but they never run out of ammo. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Matt Walsh becoming the conservative version of Borat is not what I was expecting.

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I love how Robin D‚ÄôAngelo is smart enough to anticipate it being necessary to ask who Walsh is but not to anticipate just how necessary it is to find out who he is.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,THAT ENDING! ‚ÄúYou can never be too careful‚Ä¶‚Äù ü§£ She has NO idea.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,This is clearly just a massive plot to show that Clark Kent&#39;s disguise was actually reasonable.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I am a college history professor.  It is crazy town.  In one meeting I said I don&#39;t judge people by the color of their skin and the other professor lost her mind.  It just encourages me to share all my lectures.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Matt sitting down with Robin DiAngelo is gonna be a wild ride.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"That‚Äôs crazy for the lady to say that the system is broken and this country needs to burn. Meanwhile, she‚Äôs sitting at a dinner table eating fine cuisine while others in Third World Countries are starving."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,&quot;You can never be too careful.&quot;<br>Troll level: <b>OVER 9000</b>
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"The fact that Robin DiAngelo didn&#39;t know who Matt Walsh was, and we all recognize her immediately, just says so much about the two camps in this country.  Can&#39;t wait to see this."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"‚ÄúRacism is not dead, but it is on life support ‚Äì kept alive by politicians, race hustlers and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as ‚Äòracists‚Äô ‚Äù ~ Thomas Sowell"

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Robin Diangelo NOT recognizing Matt Walsh at the end was hilarious and perfect.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,The most impressive thing about Matt Walsh is his ability to keep a straight face.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,All the women at The feminist dinner are exactly who I would expect
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I never thought that Superman‚Äôs glasses would work in real life. Matt just proved they would.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I cant believe Matt Walsh switched sides for the inside scoop
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"If Robin D&#39;Angelo seriously didn&#39;t know who Matt was, it just shows you how disconnected she and other people like her are from the real world."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"The way Matt responds with, &quot;You can never be too careful&quot; was probably the most gleeful he could&#39;ve felt while keeping all audible emotions perfectly hidden. He is an absolute deadpan master."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"‚ÄúIs America inherently racist?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe word inherent is challenging there‚Ä¶America is racist to its bones.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo, inherent?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù üôÑ"

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"I saw a discussion once where someone said:<br>&quot;I don&#39;t even notice the different skin colors&quot;<br>and the black girl was offended, replying:<br>&quot;So we, black people, do not exist, is that what you are saying? That&#39;s racist. We aren&#39;t white. We do look different.&quot;<br>The guy was trying so hard to not be a racist, that he got labelled a racist in the process. This wasn&#39;t a sketch. This was real life."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"Being called racist 10+ years ago meant something, now it‚Äôs just empty and meaningless."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-26,Not sure why she bothered asking his name. He gave her his real name and it still didn‚Äôt set off any alarm bells for her.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"When Robin asked who he was, i was waiting for Matt to say &quot;I&#39;m Matt, he/him&quot;"
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,No f&#39;ing way you got an interview with Robin DiAngelo after the notoriety from &quot;What is a Woman?&quot;. Matt is an absolute legend.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"I have a crazy story. My daughter has a friend from Nigeria. This girl was always very popular and loved by her peers since the kindergarten. Then, she went to high school and some ‚Äúintelligent ‚Äú teacher started to educate kids on BLM and claimed that all white people are racist towards blacks and even when they are nice to black people, it‚Äôs a form of racism. Later, this girl complained to my daughter that nobody dared to look at her or even talk to her after that class. It wasn‚Äôt because kids were racist towards her, but out of fear to be one. What a sick idea to separate kids in such ways and create a division. Glad I decided to homeschool and not teach my kids such nonsense üôà"
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Looks even funnier than What Is a Woman.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,The people who ‚Äúhate‚Äù this country the most won‚Äôt leave this country. Keep that in mind.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,This is going to be an epic eye opener for a lot of Americans that have no idea just how far these Leftists are willing to go. Matt Walsh is making himself one of the most important figures in this movement to save our country.
Am I Racist?,2024-09-09,That lady upset exclaiming &quot;Martin Luther King said a lot of stuff!&quot;
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Surprised they didn&#39;t spot him as a conservative just because he sounds like an actual man.

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"Growing up white in the 90‚Äôs in rural Alabama, driving through the woods in 4x4‚Äôs with Tupac blasting on our radio we thought being ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù was the right thing to do, that you do not see color but every person as your equal. Seems like life was much simpler and less complicated back then."
Am I Racist?,2024-08-19,"I come from a 3rd world country. Living in a 1st world country, watching these folks eat their gourmet dinner in safety, wash it down with a chilled glass, and ... complaining?! üòÇ"
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Suddenly Superman&#39;s glasses disguise doesn&#39;t seem so far fetched.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,&quot;You can never be too careful&quot;<br><br><b>Matt smiles motherf***ingly</b>
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I noticed the younger kids laugh when someone calls them racist now. Screaming racism over every single thing has killed that words power.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"Morgan Freeman was once asked about racism in a 60 Minutes interview, his response: quit talking about it, quit bringing it up, it exists because people always bring it up."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,Matt‚Äôs gonna need his own private security after this comes out

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,I hope this movie exposes race grifters the way &quot;What Is a Woman?&quot; exposed gender ideology.

Am I Racist?,2024-07-25,"‚ÄúI just had to ask you gotta be careful‚Äù ‚Äúyou can never be to careful‚Äù. Matt Walsh rolls his eyes back, and I don‚Äôt blame him."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"I&#39;m a half black woman born and raised in Northern Idaho‚Äîwhere actual neo-Nazis live. My mom always complained about the people who freaked out when she married a black man in ‚Äò88. I talked to my grandmother decades later, who pretty much said ‚Äúwe were so scared for you children! How were we supposed to know the world would change so much that you&#39;d be able to grow up without horrific bullying and being stuck between two worlds.‚Äù Race really wasn&#39;t a thing growing up. I didnt experience racism that kept me up at night until I saw some of the really disgusting notes sent to my white husband when we announced our engagement. It was 2014 and things on college campuses were heating up. DEI people ambushed him about being ‚Äúracist‚Äù for marrying a black woman (however that&#39;s supposed to work). I&#39;d been called ‚Äúnot really black‚Äù because I sound and act like a middle-class educated white girl rather than a stereotypical minority. My daughter is not only white-passing but BLONDE and I&#39;ve gotten lectures about how she needs to become more ‚Äúconscious‚Äù of her ‚Äúblackness.‚Äù My son is darker than me. To our children, skin color is as unpredictable and non-consequential as hair and eye-color. They know their ancestry is from Africa and Germany and Ireland, and we&#39;ve traced our family tree back to the 1200s‚Äîtheyre the descendent of kings from both Scotland and Africa, and it‚Äôs fun trivia. That‚Äôs the place for history and ancestory. That&#39;s the way it should be. Race is a social construct and the concept needs to die."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,The facial expression they catch from Matt when he says &quot;you can never be too careful&quot; at the end of the trailer is iconic.

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,‚ÄúYou can never be too careful‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve seen Matt Walsh smile ever.

Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"Matt Walsh just adds a wig, and TRANSforms into a lefty. Beautiful"
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,As a Black Man I recall being yelled at by my White Boss in front of everyone (I should mention he does this all the time not just to me). A fellow black colleague said I should sue on accounts of racism. At no point did I ever consider him yelling at me racist. If anything I thought he has major anger issues.  I guess I grew up in the 90s When race is not a thing like that. I may be one of the few Who is confused at this &quot;lets attack White straight men&quot; agenda because I&#39;m also fully aware that I and my &quot;species&quot; will be next in the worst way.
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"As a black man born in the 90s, living in Europe, I have witnessed the anti-white racism my hole life. It started out with whites not being allowed to comment against foreigners or immigration politics, and continued with white people being afraid to use a politically incorrect term for describing the color of my skin.<br><br>I myself have never suffered under racism, but I feel all my white friends have. My mother, having black children with my black father, has always been absolved from the inherently assumed racism she obviously is supposed to harbor, because she is white.<br><br>I live in Germany - and this is how it always has been. All Germans are afraid to be called Nazi - but especially white Germans are always at the edge of being called racist Nazis simply for being white."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-25,"For the woman who &quot;allegedly&quot;says America is trash &amp; not worth saving, I say go live in Afghanistan for a year. Let me know how that works out for you."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-26,"Not an American here, I&#39;ve travelled many countries because I used to work in UN and lived in USA for 2 years. I can confidently say USA is better than 80% of the world. So if USA isn&#39;t worth saving, there isn&#39;t much left in the WORLD worth saving."
Am I Racist?,2024-07-24,"This is too good! Chick at the end is worried he‚Äôs a conservative in disguise for a fake interview. Doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs THE conservative. Matt, you‚Äôre the GOAT."

Here,2024-06-29,"I&#39;ve lived in the same house for 52 years. I know what it&#39;s like to experience time unfold in one space. People and pets come and go. Bush turns to farms, to land subdivisions, to houses on acreage, to added community infrastructure. Trees in backyards disappear to accommodate more houses on smaller blocks. Apartments creep in. People are born and die, young and old. Love is found and lost, or remains beyond the grave. Thoughts evolve from simple to complex, then simple again. Longtime residents grow from infancy to one of the few remaining custodians of local history. A living witness to time on Earth. üåè An explorer of time, charting a course that can only be travelled once. ‚è≥"
Here,2024-06-26,"I like the idea of timelines captured in a single frame, it‚Äôs like a movie stage play"
Here,2024-06-26,I&#39;m going to tell my kids this is Forrest Gump 2
Here,2024-07-12,"Too sad. It looks beautiful.  Maybe it&#39;s just my age, but too sad. My husband and I sold our first home when we were in our early 60s. I walked through the house one last time trying to hide my tears. So much had happened! Now, he&#39;s gone and I&#39;m living in our second home, and sometimes,  the tears fall. I expect to hear his voice summoning me to see something on his computer, or ask me why I&#39;m not up yet, or asking me what is for dinner... life passes by so very fast. A  home without love is just a house. Time is the cruelest master of all."
Here,2024-06-26,In an era where risk-taking in cinema is increasingly rare it&#39;s good to see Zemeckis willing to just go for it.
Here,2024-10-29,"I don&#39;t know how this film will do (best of luck), but I understand the concept. I recently found my childhood home online on a realtor site, and looking at the photos I see things me and my Dad worked on when we lived there along with some of the changes that were made by other families who lived there after us. But I look at the photos of those empty rooms and I can still picture so many memories of the people that filled those rooms, the furniture we had, our first color TV, Christmas trees and trains, huge  holiday family dinners stretching from the dining room to the living room, our dog, friends, neighbors and family visits, you name it. <br>It&#39;s nice to be able to take a trip down memory lane like that to remind you, no matter how fast life seems to fly by, we all did a heck of a lot of stuff, it just doesn&#39;t seem like it at the time..."
Here,2024-06-26,"You gotta hand it to Zemeckis, this man GOES FOR IT."
Here,2024-07-03,"And at the end, he flies away in the house attached to thousands of balloons"
Here,2024-06-26,I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúa ghost story‚Äùmeets ‚Äúthe tree of life‚Äù vibe from this trailer.
Here,2024-06-27,"I highly recommend the graphic novel this is based on. ‚ÄúHere‚Äù is by Richard McGuire and set in the same exact perspective, spanning decades, centuries, millions and even billions of years across all time periods (but especially the events inside the room). I spotted so many shots in this trailer taken directly from the book, so I‚Äôm excited"
Here,2024-06-29,The de-aging technology is incredible. Seeing &quot;young&quot; Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in a new movie blows my mind.
Here,2024-08-12,"Kind of refreshing to see trailers for something other than horror, crime and superhero movies."
Here,2024-10-23,"My mom passed last November, so we just sold the home my great grandmother, grandparents, parents, and two brothers lived it from 1950 until 2024. All have passed but for one brother. Plus my sister and her family live in the family home we grew up in from 1955 to now, 2024! So that movie might be hard for me to watch. Strange they have Robin Wright paired up with Tom again. They are forever Forrest and Jenny even as other characters."
Here,2024-06-26,"&quot;You&#39;re my girl&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;ll always be your girl, Forrest.&quot;"
Here,2024-06-26,"Jon Anderson is still an amazing vocalist and after all these years YES manages to sound fresh, insightful, sometimes and magnificent. <br>Forever they will be discovered by new generations, that makes me content."
Here,2024-06-29,"Fortunately, people like Zemeckis, Hanks, Wright still exist. Thank you."
Here,2024-06-27,"‚ÄúYou could spend the night here.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI could spend the rest of my life here.‚Äù<br>.<br>Simple quotes, but with the majestic meaning.<br>Zemeckis at his finest."
Here,2024-09-12,"I‚Äôm absolutely whole heartedly going to love this! We‚Äôre moving into my wife‚Äôs childhood home, her father has passed and we just helped her mother into a 55 + home. The memories she has there and the new ones were going to make are one of the greatest gifts our lives grant us. This is going to be a great movie! And what a great soundtrack with YES!"
Here,2024-06-26,"Oh guys, you made a movie where Forrest and Jenny are finally together as a happily married couple. You made me cry. Thank you so much. You don‚Äôt know what it means to a Forrest Gump fan like me to finally see that. It‚Äôs so beautiful üò≠"
Here,2024-07-01,"This preview has me crying . The passing of time is hard to accept face, and inevitable"
Here,2024-06-29,"Here is what we all study for, what we all work for, and what we all fight for. Many people spend their whole lives thinking that &quot;here&quot; is in the future, but the truth is, &quot;here&quot; is already here."
Here,2024-07-07,"An original, positive, mature, uplifting story with actual movie stars? I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make those. More of this please!"
Here,2024-06-27,Cinematographer: How you wanna setup this shot?<br><br>Zemeckis: Just set the camera down. Thanks!
Here,2024-06-26,Proof that using Yes in a soundtrack is always a great idea
Here,2024-06-28,"I can&#39;t explain how emotional I&#39;ve got with this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_id-SkGU2k&amp;t=109"">1:49</a>-minute trailer. I&#39;m crying. I&#39;m expecting so much from this movie."
Here,2024-06-26,The technology slowly scares you but the premise of letting the film run from this chosen perspective at a certain point is brilliant. Sitcom moderately brilliant.
Here,2024-06-26,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie it‚Äôs so strange being 22 and seeing Tom hanks well look only just a few years older than me in 2024, on the other hand Forrest Gump is literally my favorite movie and this looks like it‚Äôs going to be just as magical in its own light."
Here,2024-06-26,The use of the Yes song is perfect.  Just lovely.
Here,2024-06-26,I never thought I&#39;d be so happy to see de-aged Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. Showing them through the years like this is going to be a rollercoaster of emotions. This is Cinema at it&#39;s best!
Here,2024-09-18,The prehistoric scenes transitioning into the modern era was very well done.
Here,2024-07-05,Song is ‚ÄùI‚Äôve Seen All Good People‚Äù by Yes
Here,2024-06-26,Zemmy please cook i can&#39;t keep defending you
Here,2024-08-06,My grandparents lived in the same house from 1941 to 2012 when my grandma passed. What an amazing journey. Gonna definitely see this one in the theater
Here,2024-06-27,"Forrest Gump came out in 1994, the same year I was born. This is how we‚Äôre celebrating our 30th birthday! Mr. Forrest Gump, you‚Äôre always my favorite person ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Here,2024-06-26,"Welcome back 1980&#39;s Tom Hanks, we missed you."
Here,2024-06-26,Welcome back Robert Zemeckis. This looks absolutely beautiful.
Here,2024-06-27,Forrest Gump: Adventuring everywhere!<br>2024: Here
Here,2024-06-26,"Forrest Gump reunion!!!!!!<br><br>Hanks, Wright, Zemeckis and Roth!!!!!!"
Here,2024-06-26,"We have to admit, this is such a Zemeckis type movie."
Here,2024-10-07,You had me at YES playing Your Move.  Sounds great still after 50 years
Here,2024-06-26,That last line was a dagger through the heart. üò≠
Here,2024-06-26,Forrest and Jenny again???<br>In Robert Zemeckis film??<br>Wow
Here,2024-06-26,"Welp, wasn‚Äôt expecting to cry early this morning."
Here,2024-06-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_id-SkGU2k&amp;t=60"">1:00</a> is the Forrest and Jenny closure I needed in my life. Thank you Mr. Zemeckis."
Here,2024-06-28,Why am I crying already?
Here,2024-06-26,This might be the ultimate Zemeckis movie. Filled with heart and a big emphasis on experimental special effects. Curious as always
Here,2024-06-30,"If the trailer made me tear up, this movie is going to have me bawling in the theaters"
Here,2024-06-26,This is in top 3 anticipated comic book movies of this year.
Here,2024-07-05,Whomever the boomer or genxer that chose the Yes song for this is an absolute GOAT creative!  Cheers and a large pint of beer clinks! this song married to the imagery is perfection!!!
Here,2024-10-23,"This Film looks very interesting, anything with Tom Hanks is usually very good. The House where so many wonderful memories happen, and yes Time does go by fast. I remember my Grandmother and then my Mom telling me to embrace every season, I am in my 60s and I feel like in my head I am maybe 30 years old <br>But my body tells me otherwise, the people and experience‚Äôs of a lifetime. I have no regrets except that I didn‚Äôt travel more than I did, but I am still the only person in my family who has been to Europe and the UK, <br>I doubt I will see Asia, but I am lucky enough. Time, is the only thing we really can‚Äôt control, no matter what we do the seasons past us by. I Love the fact that they are using the song, All Good People by YES in the trailer. The trailer does show us how the Film might end, but I bet it has a little more to the story than that last frame. Like someone said, it‚Äôs refreshing to see a new Film come out that is not, Super Hero‚Äôs, Horror or creepy Science Fiction, oh and just down right stupid. <br>I use to go see a movie once a week, then Covid came and the little art house Theater couldn‚Äôt survive. <br>I hope this Film is good."
Here,2024-06-26,Written by Eric Roth.<br><br><br>I&#39;m in
Here,2024-06-27,Nice to finally see YES get some recognition for one of their greatest songs EVER!!!
Here,2024-07-01,Uncanny valley and Robert Zemeckis. Name a more iconic duo.
Here,2024-07-03,I am already crying at the T-Rex running away from the meteorite. I won&#39;t make it &#39;til the end.
Here,2024-06-26,I absolutely love the premise. Everything about it. I&#39;ll be there day one.
Here,2024-06-28,Nice -- Zemekis pushing the envelope of tech and story....and Robin Wright not playing a hardened woman for a change. Plus Forrest and Jenny back together.....hope this is movie magic
Here,2024-06-29,"Is anyone else in tears just from the trailer??? Man, this is going to be an emotional ride."
Here,2024-06-26,"As someone who watches and have all the episodes of Robin Wright on soap opera Santa Barbara (1984-1988), I think her de-aging in this movie is really good."
Here,2024-06-26,I immediately have a feeling this will be a masterpiece
Here,2024-06-28,"In less than two minutes tears were streaming down my face.  I&#39;m almost 70, this may be a dangerous movie for me to watch."
Here,2024-08-21,"I saw this trailer in the movie theaters a few weeks ago and I&#39;m thinking to myself &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see this movie on November 15th!&quot;  This movie looks good, Tom Hanks and Robin Wright are back working together again and the magic is back.  Robert Zemeckis is an amazing director and it is great to see him working with Tom Hanks again.  Thanks and have a good day!"
Here,2024-07-02,"Well this is going to be an obvious Oscar contender. <br>No boubt, I&#39;m gonna be shedding tears watching this one."
Here,2024-06-26,It perfectly catched novel&#39;s feature.<br>&quot;HERE&quot; will be one of the gratest film zemeckis ever made.
Here,2024-06-26,Oh man this gonna be wonderful. You can never go wrong with Zemeckis and Hanks as a duo.
Here,2024-06-27,"The first a major movie studio mentioned, ‚ÄúContact‚Äù. A hidden gem of science fiction movies."
Here,2024-06-27,"The life that these people have in this trailer is everything I want for the family I‚Äôm building right now as a 26 year old. Truly inspiring, can‚Äôt wait to see it"
Here,2024-06-26,It&#39;s been 30 years but we finally get to see Forrest and Jenny living happily ever after
Here,2024-06-26,From Wikipedia <br><br>‚ÄúThe film uses a new generative artificial intelligence technology called Metaphysic Live to face-swap and de-age the actors in real time as they perform instead of using additional post-production processing methods.‚Äù
Here,2024-07-01,"What a wonderful use of Yes music, Jon Anderson recorded this in 1970, &amp; imo he remains the only active vocalist from that era who&#39;s voice is almost completely intact. He&#39;s on tour right now on the cusp of 80 performing this &amp; other Yes classics. Blowing minds every show &amp; worth every penny. If he comes near you don&#39;t miss him üëçüèªüëçüèª"
Here,2024-06-26,"Everyone keeps talking about the de-aging process, but I‚Äôm more compelled by the framing device. Just as I was compelled by the graphic novel it‚Äôs based on. To have a static shot in that format is one thing - it can be expected. To have it in a wide release, over 90 minute, big budget studio film is daring. I‚Äôm really looking forward to this."
Here,2024-06-27,"1994: Tom Hanks and Robin Wright collaborate in Forest Gump with director Robert Zemeckis.<br><br>2024: 30 years later, Tom, Robin, and Robert collaborate again for this cinematic journey through time!<br><br>Interesting cast, yet really excited for this one since I&#39;ve enjoyed Robert Zemeckis&#39; other classics like BTTF, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Polar Express and of course, Forest Gump."
Here,2024-06-27,"I haven&#39;t watched a movie in the theaters since 2021, I&#39;m definitely going to have to see this when it comes out. Being someone who has seen many Robert Zemeckis-directed films, this seems like a must-watch for me.<br><br>Also, huge credit to the person who used Yes&#39; &#39;I&#39;ve Seen All Good People&#39; in this trailer, hearing it while watching this trailer made me tear up and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever gotten emotional over a trailer in my life before. Loving Prog-Rock, I used to listen to Yes for years and I can say their music makes me emotional sometimes. It&#39;s awesome to see their music getting recognition again. Great stuff!"
Here,2024-06-26,"Not every Zemeckis film is golden, but you can&#39;t deny that he gave us all-time classics (like Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), and he tries to make something outside the box."
Here,2024-07-01,"There are no words. This takes the cake. Thank you, Robert Zemeckis, for understanding American history and presenting it in such an emotional way. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è"
Here,2024-06-27,I‚Äôm gonna cry so much in the theatre‚Ä¶all right I‚Äôm in
Here,2024-07-01,One of my favorite YES songs.   This looks fun.
Here,2024-10-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_id-SkGU2k&amp;t=47"">0:47</a> why did the camera disappear."
Here,2024-08-10,This is classic Zemeckis. I love it when he experiments with special effects.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Thanks so much for including our music in this incredible film üôèüôè
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-24,"Bonhoeffer&#39;s last recorded words were, ‚Äúthis is the end for me, the beginning of life.‚Äù"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,"This is literally a prayer answered. Reading his biography was not enough. He is such an inspiring man devoted to his unwavering faith in God. Thanks, angel studios!"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-25,"I do so hope this film will be released in South Africa. Bonhoeffer was a touchstone of faith and a hero for us here during the dark days of Apartheid South Africa. The late Rev John Boorman - our Methodist minister in the 70s often referenced him in his sermons. Bonhoeffer&#39;s faith and compassion was an inspiration to those from the English churches who were standing up for those who were marginalised, persecuted and unseen. So grateful to Angel Studios for telling his story."
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-13,"Thank you for this movie. His faith and courage should be honored. People need to know many Germans did oppose the Nazis. My grandmother was one of them, also devout Lutheran."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"I am looking forward to Bonhoeffer finally getting the attention he deserves, not only for his unwavering faith in God, but also for his righteous bravery in the fight to destroy a demonic enemy. Thank you Angel studios. I will attend its release along with my entire family."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,I like that Angel is trying to help us return to traditional storytelling and uplifting stories.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"After Sounds of Freedom I started watching your films. I‚Äôm impressed of the quality for an independent company. This trailer made me emotional. I was tired of watching content without meaning. I stopped going to the cinema, but I really want to watch this movie now. Keep creating art. You clearly know what you are doing. Thanks."
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-17,"&quot;Hate comes in every Colour&quot;<br>A healthy reminder that all of us need accountability.<br>Me, You, Everyone."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,"I am SO EXCITED for this film!! My German father of Jewish descent (but of Christian faith) taught us all our lives about the great Bonhoeffer and I am STOKED now to see his story on the screen for all the world to know. I never go to theatres but I will be there on opening day for this one! (Also my friend is in it, and that&#39;s incredibly cool, but definitely secondary to the important story.)"
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-06,Every time I go to watch an Angel Studios movie in theaters I always see a trailer to an even better one.
Bonhoeffer,2024-08-27,"Cried through 3 repeated watches of this trailer. It is HIGH TIME this man‚Äôs life and courage is brought to film. As a teenager in the early 2000s I loved this man‚Äôs story so much and saw him as such a hero of the faith that I was determined to name one of my future kids Dietrich. üòå Cannot wait to see this and from what I‚Äôve seen so far, I feel Angel Studios is going to do him justice and I‚Äôm so grateful for that."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,Wow. I have chills. CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS IN THEATERS!!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,This gave me chills. This man is a true Father of the Faith and a picture of true belief and martyrdom.
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-17,"Disturbed&#39;s cover of the sound of silence is one of my all time favorite song. A movie trailer has to be really good to be worthy of this song, you guys nailed it.  Looking forward to the movie!"
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-09,This is the most I‚Äôve been excited for a movie in literally years.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,I am so stoked for this Angel studios just keeps putting out these bangers!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-24,OMG!!! I had just finished his biography and thought to myself...someone really needs to make his movie. And here it is!!! Tysm!!! üòçüòçüòç
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-09,I‚Äôve been waiting for this story to be told on the big screen for awhile. Very glad to see this happening.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,This gave me chills. I cannot wait to see this. I have read Bonhoeffer‚Äôs biography by Eric Metaxes and he was amazing. Such a hero for us today.
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-11,The song on the trailer gives me chills. Vince is incredibly intense. Can&#39;t wait to see this movie. Thank you Angel Studio for spreading the word like you do.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-24,"Powerful. The music with the trailer, powerful. Excellent."
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-12,"Oh, my word! I have been so anxious to see this man‚Äôs story on the big screen. He has been a hero to me for a long time. I pray that his story inspires many of us to rise up in the perilous times that we now live in."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-22,&#39;Sound of silence&#39; in the background is perfect
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,Wow!<br>Probably the best Christian trailer I&#39;ve seen since Passion of the Christ over 20+ yrs ago.<br>Bonhoeffer&#39;s story is a powerful one. May we remember the errors of Germany&#39;s ways and may God bless this film.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,wow. Angles studios is truly shifting the movie culture
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-22,Always great to see stories of heroic resistance to evil.  Here&#39;s one for you.  Fr. Maximillian Kolbe.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Thanks for produce Bohnhoeffer&#39;s history. It can&#39;t be forgotten.
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-14,"Oh my gosh. Im not normally into these kinds of movies, but absolutely fascinated with WWII. I want so badly to see this movie. I trust Angel Studios to do an amazing job and i want to support REAL movies. The trailer is the absolutely best trailer ive ever seen. Had me on the edge of my seat and my heart racing and just the EMOTION from a TRAILER. Cannot wait to see this"
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-09,"I was never the biggets fan of disturbed version of this song, but my god does it really hold power with this trailer! Well done on this, and I cant wait to see the film"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-26,I gotta say this looks indeed great. &quot;The sounds of silence.&quot; Gave me chills.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-26,One of my favorite Christian heroes along with Corrie Ten Boom
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-13,"I CAN&#39;T wait, his story needs to be told worldwide. Belivers should stand up for the oppressed and the minority ‚úäüèø"
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-20,YES! Another melodramatic biography! I can&#39;t get enough of these!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-22,This song &quot;Sound of Silence&quot; sung by Jewish  David Draiman is perfect! It was the silence of the world that allowed the Holocaust to happen.
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-05,"I&#39;ve always admired Bonhoeffer, loved the Barmen Declaration, and studied the Deutche Christen heresy and persecution. It&#39;s always been a shame to me that we haven&#39;t had them depicted in a movie like this, and here it is! I&#39;m so excited."
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-12,"Just saw this movie at AMC Screen Unseen. Had no idea what we were in for, but wow it was awe-inspiring and impactful. I&#39;m not religious, but seeing the way he was portrayed as truly devoted to his religion and saving his country was enough to make me shed tears at least twice during the movie (my mom probably 8 times) - acting was amazing and I&#39;m glad I got to learn the story of Bonhoeffer"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,VERY provocative! I can&#39;t wait to see this in theatres @AngelStudios!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"This is such an incredible story. As a Lutheran, with family stories from this time, it means a lot."
Bonhoeffer,2024-10-09,"So happy I was part of this production, I can&#39;t wait. It&#39;s gonna be beautiful."
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZM90izJ8sI&amp;t=74"">1:14</a> That vocal gives me chills. Perfect song for this amazing trailer. Bonhoeffer&#39;s testament to faith always shakes me to my core. Thank you for this film and music."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Nothing beats true stories (ie.e TESTIMONIES)
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,Can‚Äôt wait to see this - more light from Angel studios!
Bonhoeffer,2024-08-18,"Mieszkam 6 km od wsi, w kt√≥rej mieszka≈Ça babcia Marii von Wedemeyer ( Ruth von Kleist-Retzow ) i w kt√≥rej prawdopodobnie napisa≈Ç wiele fragment√≥w swojej &quot;Etyki&quot;. Mama Marii pochodzi≈Ça z pruskiego Kieckow (Kikowa). Cieszƒô siƒô, ≈ºe powstaje ten film, bo Dietrich bywa≈Ç wielokrotnie na naszych terenach i przez to jest mi jeszcze bardziej bliski."
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-12,I‚Äôm not a Christian but I love the studio and I love the films that they bring out. I‚Äôll definitely be going to see this :)
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-05,"The editing for this trailer -- especially with the appropriation of this song, specifically -- is outstanding.<br><br>As the noted himself: &quot;To not act, is to act. To not speak, is to speak.&quot; He chose to act, to speak -- to demonstrate that grace, though freely given, was is not cheap but costly.<br><br>Very much looking forward to the viewing."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-26,This is exactly the movie our society needs right now. I can&#39;t wait for this!
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-01,Holy cow!!  Angel studios is putting out some really great stuff!  I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it but bravo!
Bonhoeffer,2024-10-26,"Couldn&#39;t help but cry when he said, &quot;I am ready to meet my destiny. &quot; My dad&#39;s last words were &quot;I am ready&quot; before he went to be with the Lord."
Bonhoeffer,2024-10-15,"I just got my tickets for November 21st! Bringing the tissues! The beauty of people standing against evil, the beauty of people loving Jesus in the most desperate of times allows me to cry for the Goodness of God, and the tragedy of mankind.  Thank you Jesus, for everything. üíóüôè‚úùÔ∏è Oh yeah, and this version of the song is crazy good!!"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Bonhoeffer + Disturbed&#39;s version of Sound of Silence = 100%   Bravo!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Haven&#39;t seen a trailer drop this hard in a long long time
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-18,Yes an amazing story! I read a book about pastor Bonhoeffer. So glad this story will be told on the big screen ‚ù§
Bonhoeffer,2024-07-18,This looks way better than I expected.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"Looks great! I&#39;d love to see more of these films on heroes of the Christian faith. In particular, I&#39;d like to see films on David Wilkerson (&#39;The Cross &amp; The Switchblade&#39;) + Nicky Cruz (&#39;Run Baby Run&#39;), like a part 1 &amp; 2, but also a fresh adaptation of &#39;The Hiding Place&#39;."
Bonhoeffer,2024-11-05,Gracias por su incre√≠ble y maravilloso trabajo üôå‚ù£Ô∏èüí™
Bonhoeffer,2024-10-02,"Thank you, Kampourises for making this important film!<br><br>Encountered Bonhoeffer during the two years I studied the holocaust and the Nazi era in German History at the university masters level. While i greatly appreciate Eric Metaxis, Bonhoeffer would have appalled to hear himself called a ‚Äúmartyr,‚Äù so you got that part right.  Bonhoeffer did do some service as a pastor but was known and highly respected as a professor of ethics on both side of the Atlantic, which is why he was chosen to be the world spokesman for the Valkyrie group had they succeeded.  Delighted you are telling his timely story!"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"Wow!!! Not familiar with the story but I&#39;m excited to watch and learn more. I love a good spy movie, especially based on true events"
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-24,Looks incredible. About time for a movie about Bonhoeffer
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-25,The biography by Eric Metaxes is unforgettable. I can‚Äôt wait to see the film!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-21,Very exited to watch this movie!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,Go Angel Studios!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-25,Breathtaking Faith and Strength at very dark moments in time. A must see!
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,Stoked! Can&#39;t wait to see it for the first time.
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-20,"Walter&#39;s Bible at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZM90izJ8sI&amp;t=20"">0:20</a>. üò≠<br>He used it for daily devotions for the rest of his life."
Bonhoeffer,2024-06-26,Goosebumps All over..!
Bonhoeffer,2024-10-07,"Bonhoeffer was not silent on societal and political evils that were against Christ and his Word. He was outspoken against the evil gaining power, even political power in Germany. Many modern reformed evangelicals today, especially those apart of the ‚Äúgospel centered movement‚Äù, will watch and love this movie, not even realizing they are nothing like Bonhoeffer when it comes to his Christlike boldness."
Bonhoeffer,2024-09-21,"Cannot wait. Looks incredible. &#39;Cost of Freedom&#39; is one of my favorite films. As someone born in Berlin, Bonhoeffer&#39;s story has always hit me on another level."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-19,77 children adopted by 22 families in one town and at the same time? I definitely want to see this movie! &#39;Love never gives up.&quot;‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-07,"Sound of freedom: Save children from Sex Traffickers.<br><br>Sound of Hope: Save children from Child Abusers.<br><br>Angel Studio You are on a another level of sending the right message to Moviegoers! Hollywood is nothing like you when it comes to sending a truly good message."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-23,"I have been saying for nearly twenty years that the future of Christian movies is going to be telling true stories of Christians acting out the gospel in the world. So far, Christian fiction films are schlocky and mediocre at best. But telling true stories not only helps avoid the preachiness that often gets in the way of the drama, but there‚Äôs tremendous value in showcasing impressive people of God and the real things they‚Äôve done. True stories are moving in a way fiction generally isn‚Äôt."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-26,9 years ago my wife &amp; I read the book about the little church in East Texas that stepped up &amp; took in 77 kids in the foster care system.  It was one of several things that helped us make the decision to foster.  We will be seeing this movie‚Ä¶and I fully expect it to make this grown man cry‚Ä¶
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-14,Hollywood can learn a thing or two from Angel Studios. They&#39;re making good movies that send powerful messages that are great for families and society as a whole. Christ is King!
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-13,This is true christianity. Thanks Angel Studios for bring a bit of light in this dark world. I can&#39;t wait to see this film ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-07-03,"My wife and I were so blessed to just see this movie on opening day. Wow, what an incredible and truly anointed movie - beautiful, gut-wrenching, inspiring, tear-jerking, and powerful. As a father of eight (5 of them adopted), I knew we would like the message of this film but I&#39;m so happy to report that the QUALITY of the movie itself is far beyond anything I had hoped for - great acting, moving script, perfect ebb and flow of the plot, NOT preachy, NOT cheesy, just Jesus followers following Jesus and doing really HARD stuff that MATTERS."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-07,Watched the trailer once on the Whaddo you meme livestream and teared up; Showed my wife this and we both teared up. I will tell everyone at my church about this starting with my pastor.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-08,"Already saw it at an early showing. One of my favorite movies ever! Get out to the theater and see it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-21,There should never be a child without a &quot;safe home&quot;.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-09,"I&#39;ve fostered for 7 years.  I love the message we need to do something, but I worry about the message love conquers all.  Advocating for what a child needs sometimes means they need more than just a loving home.  I hope all that is included in the movie.  Many people have been burned out and heartbroken trying to love away RAD, ODD, FASD, boarderline personality disorders, etc."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-14,Wow! I dare you to watch this trailer without tears in your eyes. May the Lord help us all fight for children and help them know they are precious and valuable in His sight. I thank the Lord for Angel Studios bringing light to these tough issues in such a powerful way. üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-15,I am my membership with Angel Studios.  This is the beginning to changing what we watch as a family.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-25,I‚Äôm already cutting onions up in this trailer. God bless those who share love with children aside from their own‚Ä¶
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,"We saw Sound of Freedom the day it came out and it gave my husband and I a sincere realization that many many children are VICTIMS and most people have NO CLUE. It led us to conduct more research and we have not stopped spreading the message to other&#39;s. I look forward to another true movie about saving children and will again, share this. I don&#39;t understand how anyone could give this a thumbs down. SaveOurChildren."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-30,"I am a survivor of severe child abuse and neglect trafficking and CSAM. I now work to educate folks on these atrocities. in 2018 I became a therapeutic foster so I could take in children who have been abused/trafficked. these are the kiddos that no one will take because of what they have been through. Now after Covid and inflation, I am going to lose my farm unless I can come up with the funds to save it by July 25th. please pray for us. That tub seen in the trailer ...I get it! my mama scrubbed me with brillo pads in a scalding tub after selling me to men saying I was dirty and going to hell! She would also put my head under. it was horrible."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-18,"As a foster parent for 6 years, I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôre getting representation FINALLY. gosh dang this teared me up"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-06,"This looks like the representation that fostering deserves! Instant Family was fun to watch but didn&#39;t show what fostering is really like. Thank you Angel Studios! YOU are sharing the stories that bring the light! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23amplifylight"">#AmplifyLight</a>"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-19,There&#39;s so many kids in Foster care and we have to be the Change that we want to see!<br>I&#39;m responsible for one child that was in Foster care she has grown up in a loving family and she&#39;s my niece. If we all commit to finding a loving home for kids we could change the System even if we do it one child at a time!üôÇüíïüëèüèæüôèüèæüíØ‚ù£Ô∏è
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-29,"My family and I went to see this movie, at a special screening and it was so inspirational. Even my husband cried and he is one tough hombre. <br>The theater was FULL! Of course they put it in a small theater, but we were the first ones there and I thought we would be alone. People started to arrive and I was astonished. <br>I have sent this video trailer to all my friends and encouraged them to go see it. I‚Äôm gonna talk to my pastor next, to see if he will organize a field trip after church, and those that want to go can meet there. <br>Also, I want to go visit their church one of these weekends and worship with them. Possum Trot is right here in Texas!"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-24,"This movie is going to break my heart and I can&#39;t wait to see it! I fostered kids, and adopted 2 who were so wounded the state documented their chances of permanency as zero. It has been stressful and even a nightmare at times, but seeing where they are now, versus where they came from, makes it all worth it. We are the adults. We make the sacrifices so kids can be kids. I wish more people would make the same kind of commitment to a kid who needs a forever home. It is a massive commitment, but if I can do it, a lot of others can too."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-26,Glorify God! Hallelujah!!
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-12,I will definitely go to see this movie! Thank you Angel Studios for standing for the children! This does give me hope for our precious babies in the world! I pray for each child everyday ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-16,"Oh man, 30 seconds in and I‚Äôm already sobbing. What an amazing community"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-23,"Lord I pray for all the children, for their safety, guidance and rescuing for the evil ones!!üôèüò¢"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-06,Such a beautiful story.  Wow
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-07-02,Angel Studios... never a more fitting name. God bless you all!
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,"Everyone needs to see this movie. It&#39;s another one of these ones that everybody needs to see. I just came back from my private showing at night. And let me tell you it was really, really good. A lot of people were coming out of bed talking wasn&#39;t many people to go and see it, but there wasn&#39;t a lot of people coming out talking about it. So I definitely highly recommend this one. I&#39;m giving this one also a 13 out of 13 skulls and say everybody needs to see this movie.  You need to test it, I&#39;m tell everyone to go see it that you know.Tell them to tell everybody that they now and someone is so forth.Everybody needs to see this movie"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-23,God bless the kids who need families !!!!
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-21,"This was the sign to be a foster parent for me. I wanna help these kids, too."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,Got to see an early release of it today and it was such a great movie. Definitely going to make you cry.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-07-01,I was holding back tears watching the trailer. I must support this movie to bring awareness. All kids deserve a loving home and family. This is heartbreaking.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-19,"I rarely cry, and this trailer made me sob. I can&#39;t imagine how much I&#39;d cry over the span of the movie. Can&#39;t wait to see it."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-29,The trailer made me cry--especially the little boy shouting no when he saw the faucet running. My little brother and I were terrified of baths after having our heads held under the tub spout when our foster mom washed our hair. She was cruel. She was one of over 20 foster homes I was in.  I don&#39;t know if I can watch this movie. But I&#39;ll donate to the cause! üëç
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,The trailer had me tearing up. I&#39;m a grown man. Watching that kid react to bath time almost took me out.  I am not strong enough to watch this. IJS. Looks like a powerful piece filled with powerful performances. üëèüò¢
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-25,"When the trailer gets you bawling, you know the movie is going to be so good! Coincidentally one of my children who is adopted from foster care has a bday the weekend this movie hits theaters. We are definitely going to go see this. ‚ù§"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,No doubt I‚Äôll be in theaters for this with the family. Thank you Angel studios. You guys are really doing good work out here.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-14,"Wow! The trailer alone got me, this is going to be a hard one to get through but needs to be seen."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-18,"A heartbreaking story ‚ù§ <br>I wish Netflix make movies like this, on important to show society of reality"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-15,"Angel studios is on a role. I&#39;m so tired of seeing the usual action movie with blood, sex, cursing, lgbtq, the usual. We need movies with actual messages and those centered around Christ. Thanks for sending that message angel studios. I&#39;m definitely supporting y&#39;all to the end."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-16,Looks like it will be very good. But 99% chance Hollywood and critics will hate it.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-27,"During a pre-release screening, I sang along with familiar hymns, laughed a little, cried a lot (both happy and sad tears), and felt my heart strings pulled in a way I can&#39;t exactly describe. Now, I&#39;m challenged... what do I do? This movie... at this time.., seems to serve as a clarion call."
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-13,"Thank you, Angle Studio!!!"
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-14,Will definitely be watching. God bless Angel Studio&#39;s. üôè

Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-22,The family unit is the ONLY foundation to build Americans on. We can&#39;t ever let it be deemed &quot;unnecessary.&quot;
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-20,Thank you Angel for your top shelf content.  I wish values were valued more than the crazy and petty content so popular today.
Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-27,Crying my eyes out already.

Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,2024-06-09,"Looking forward to watch this! Will recom this to my friends and coworkers. Press on! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamjesus"">#TeamJESUS</a>"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,I like how Toho is modernising the franchise without losing their style or identity.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,It‚Äôs always refreshing to see Godzilla return to his villain role every once in a while. And the fact that this movie is set right after Japan loses WW2.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"The idea of Godzilla holding a grudge against an entire country, then waiting for them to be at their weakest before striking at them again is... It&#39;s actually really chilling."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-09,This was genuinely a masterpiece. I never expected a Godzilla film to be this amazing but my god. One of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie theater.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"you know you are doing great with a character, when even 69 Years later it still gives goosebumps generation after generation"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us,&quot; followed by the roar was absolutely bone-chilling."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"Looks incredible ! I love the way they show Godzilla isn&#39;t just walking around, he destroyes EVERYTHING."
Godzilla Minus One,2024-03-11,Historic moment.<br>Godzilla minus one won the Oscar.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,My favorite part of this whole trailer is how they managed to implement the impact that godzilla inflicts to the city by just walking! Like the ground breaks with every step
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,It&#39;s nice to see Godzilla treated as a horror monster instead of just an action hero
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,Love this moment when Godzilla took a step and the ground was pushed up. Stunning.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-04,‚ÄúThat monster will never forgive us‚Äù is by and large the most chilling and amazing line ever uttered in a Godzilla film.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster...will never forgive us&quot;<br>That line sent chills. I like that.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"Can we just applaud Takashi Yamazaki? This man directed, wrote, and did the VFX of this movie. Even if this movie someway, somehow manages to fail, you gotta give this man props."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; confrims that this is exactly the kind of Godzilla story I love.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-11-03,"I love that you can feel the overwhelming power of Godzilla, even the apocalyptic theme returning to Godzilla&#39;s original message."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,‚ÄúThat monster‚Ä¶will never forgive us.‚Äù I love that line. This movie is gonna be great
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"It really feels like a modern proper remake of 54. The roar, the atmosphere, the destruction. What a time to be a Godzilla fan"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I think the most amazing aspect is that we see people&#39;s deaths. We don&#39;t watch Godzilla walk through city streets from an eagle-eye view, we&#39;re on the ground as Godzilla tears through buildings and people are flung into the air or crushed. The human suffering is always hidden away, which will make this movie truly horrifying and real."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-03,"Just saw this movie this weekend. One of the best films of all time and in my top 5, out of the 1000s of movies I&#39;ve seen in my life.  Simply perfect!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster‚Ä¶ will never forgive us.&quot; As it cuts to Godzilla‚Äôs roar sends chills up my spine. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters. This looks amazing!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-10,"people tend to forget the the original Gojira was intended as a horror movie, aimed at the horrors of nuclear weapons and war, i love how this brings him back to that root and makes him terrifying<br><br>also that roar is just..."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-07,"Godzilla has always been a fascinating paradox. He is a character with the dichotomy of being either a destructive monster and a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power, or a comic book superhero and defender of Earth, as well as a symbol of Japanese national pride."
Godzilla Minus One,2024-01-01,"This one nearly flew under the radar. I spotted it randomly whilst looking at film listings. 10/10, I literally have no words on how great this film is and what a joy it was to watch such great storytelling and action. I echo the thoughts of other comments about how emotional this film was. The themes it touched on. This pisses all over anything Hollywood produced and will ever produced."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,As a 32 year old who&#39;s loved Godzilla my whole life... this is everything!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-08,That classic roar sent chills down my spine‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the first time a Godzilla roar actually sounded ominously frightening!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"Although I‚Äôm used to Godzilla being the protagonist, this classic antagonistic Godzilla has me screaming out of joy, never been so satisfied with the glory and beauty of such an iconic figure"
Godzilla Minus One,2024-03-11,The time has come.<br>The Godzilla franchise won his first Oscar ever.<br>Congratulation.<br>What a great time to be a Godzilla fan.<br><br><br>Long love the king.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,For someone that has been a Godzilla fan since childhood this is what I have always wanted: a modern remake of the original with all its themes and commentary intact.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,the way Godzilla is breaking the ground by stepping shows he&#39;s not messing around and i love it
Godzilla Minus One,2024-01-07,"Man, not going to lie. This is a really good version of Godzilla. There were even a few tears in the audience. Very pleased and very well done!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; This line got me hyped especially if it means what I think it means. Godzilla being both a force of destruction and an actual character with goals and personality, the last where we see him completly scared made me hopeful we will dive into his tragic backstory too."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"The design for Godzilla is amazing considering it seems to be paying homage to what inspired his original design to begin with. Scarred, radiation-burnt flesh to signify the way he was created."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I‚Äôm 68 years old, I have loved Godzilla since the first one came out way back in the day! I‚Äôve already told my daughter that I want to see this movie as my Christmas present!"
Godzilla Minus One,2024-03-12,"This movie has won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a well deserved Award."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"You can tell that this will be gory and brutal, since you hardly see people get directly killed by Godzilla, save for a handful of movies."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-10-14,&quot;That monster... will never forgive us&quot; Is such a great line
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"From the looks of this trailer I think it‚Äôs really cool how much emphasis they‚Äôre putting on the devastation Godzilla causes to humanity. Not like it hasn‚Äôt been done in previous entries but to see the emotion the impact, the actual destruction of Japan in a perspective like this hasn‚Äôt  been done in a while"
Godzilla Minus One,2024-01-30,Just saw this film and was blown away with how incredible it was.  It puts modern American films with big budgets to shame. This film combined a compelling humanistic story with the thrill of kaiju.  Fantastic film.  Definitely go watch this!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"WOW. These VFX are stunning. Particularly the physics, weight and power of everything. In particular that ship at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=66"">1:06</a>. Geeked."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,Even after nearly 70 years! They still bring the king of the monsters back to the screens! Let‚Äôs go Godzilla minus one!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,&quot;From Zero to Minus&quot; is very impactful. To face this terror post-war for Japan would be devastating
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-28,"It&#39;s about humanity, love, and war. There were tears in my eyes. Will go down as one of the classics of all time--and this generation&#39;s matter-of-fact Godzilla movie that just slays."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I&#39;m all for Godzilla being the hero, but I sure do love his roots and what he&#39;s meant to be portrayed as, a monster beyond the comprehension of men, a metaphor for destruction and outcome of war, except Godzilla is the personification of that. Just seeing this trailer gave me chills. I&#39;m so pumped for this movie."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"This movie looks incredible. Godzilla is CGI but still looks real and horrifying. I like how the destruction is shown, from the perspective of humans, being crushed, falling off buildings and getting stepped on, and I‚Äôm excited to see how they‚Äôll do the scenes with battleships! I‚Äôm unbelievably hyped for this film!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-06,Godzilla has to be the only cinema character were they can keep making movies about him and we never get bored of him. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-16,Can safely say that this is the Godzilla film we need right now. An absolute triumph of Toho Cinema.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-09,‚ÄúFrom Zero to Minus‚Äù<br><br>There‚Äôs something horrifying about this concept. This is gonna be something special
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-06,"No matter what the form of Godzilla, no matter what the series.......Godzilla always gives me the chills."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,peak has arrived
Godzilla Minus One,2024-01-15,The Japanese know how to make a good movie! Looks like the Godzilla I always wanted too see.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-11,"The roar gives me chills. I love how it‚Äôs more of a horror film, it makes Godzilla look more of a threat. Looks incredible."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"Looks incredible, I got chills. I love how it goes back to the original idea of Godzilla and what it represented post WW2"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot;<br><br>Absolute chills.
Godzilla Minus One,2024-03-11,"And now Oscar winner! Congratulations Godzilla MINUS ONE. In my humble opinion, it should have been nominated for Best Picture."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,The design feels like a mix between Heisei and Legendary. I absolutely love it.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-11,"I love the dichotomy between toho Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla in how they are both pictured as forces of nature... makes me all the more excited for this movie. <br>Legendary Godzilla is a hurricane, he doesnt care about humanity unless humanity is directly involving themselves in his business. Hes just there to do his job and defend his home<br>Toho Godzilla is like a man-made disaster, what happens when you poke at earth too much and earth pokes back. Hes directly targeting humans in retaliation. <br><br>Its two very different tones for the exact same character and we get to see both at the same time via different studios (given Monarch: Legacy of monsters will be releasing a month before this)"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"Props to Toho for bringing this to American theaters one month after Japan&#39;s premiere.<br>I recall wondering when I&#39;d get the chance to see Final Wars in theaters, back in 04/05."
Godzilla Minus One,2024-01-12,I never expected a Godzilla movie to make me cry...
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=82"">1:22</a><br>Particularly this shot. Everything in this is incredibly harrowing, but seeing Godzilla himself horrifically burnt and scarred is something else. A force of nature, almost crippled, presumably from nuclear attack, is terrifying in itself. <br>this movie is going to swim in dark tones and themes, but that was not something i was expecting"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,This is the Godzilla movie we always needed. Set in Japan and produced by Toho Studios but with cutting edge VFX effects of the Hollywood versions.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"There&#39;s so much inspiration going on in this trailer. Im getting 1954 vibes, Shin vibes, and even Legendary vibes. This movie really looks like its going to be the great film."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-27,This movie was really really good. Definitely one of my top favourite movies of the year. I cried at a few scenes so it was very emotional. Literally a masterpiece movie I loved it so much üò≠
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,I like the idea of Godzilla being destructive simply by walking around. The other movies haven‚Äôt really done a good job of explaining what his tail does and why his footsteps don‚Äôt cause hell on its own
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-06,"Yes, this is Godzilla done right. You really get the feel for the magnitude of the raw power and destruction that is Godzilla.  I‚Äôm 53 yo woman and remember watching Godzilla on TV with my father. This trailer has such a nostalgic feel to it for me, because it takes the threat that is Godzilla so seriously and it makes you feel  for the people of Japan."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,This looks epic. What a time to be alive. Classic Toho style Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla stories at the same time. We are truly blessed by Godzilla.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-04,"I saw this the night it dropped. Out of any viewable / watchable media content that I&#39;ve seen this year, Godzilla Minus One is special. The whole team behind the movie is amazing. This film has something that has been missing in most media...soul."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,Looks incredible !
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"The aspect of Japan being destroyed after World War II immediately caught my attention. It seems toho is not just making Godzilla a horror monster again, but is also being back the tragedy and loss. Something we truest have not had since the original movie."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-06,"I love that they kept the original &#39;54 roar. That one in particular had a profound effect that meshed so well with the original movie. The other roars from King Kong vs Godzilla onward sort of deceased his fear factor despite of it being so iconic. And that was the first roar I heard! When I heard him roar for the first time in the 1954 classic, I was really taken a back because it wasn&#39;t the roar that I was used to. That one was much darker and terrifying than what I heard previously as a kid. The fact that they only used it when it called for it was a great effect, and it didn&#39;t overstay it&#39;s welcome. The terror and bone-chilling feeling of that roar combined with the actions of a horrific monster of gargantuan heights makes me think this is definitely trying to go back to Godzilla&#39;s roots in the most definitive, authentic way possible. Everything else with the setting, the design, the story; it seems this time Godzilla is going to be dark. Way more darker and sinister than he&#39;s ever been. I can&#39;t wait for December 1st"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-10-25,There have been alot of famous lines throughout all the Godzilla films but the line &quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; is on a whole different level.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot; That hits so hard.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"Haven&#39;t been this excited for a movie since Shin.<br>This looks like it&#39;s going to be an amazing return to form, updated with modern tech and  a much more brutal take.<br><br>Also, I love that shot of the ship flying into a destroyed building. The effects and camerawork are stunning!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"Godzilla sure is menacing. The fact that Japan has been increasingly popular with their movie releases these days is just plain outstanding to me. We‚Äôve seen Hollywood make remakes, but with the Japanese entertainment industry, they‚Äôre taking things next level."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-03,I love this movie! This is a masterpiece.  Humans characters are interesting and i care about them. This movie has heart.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I love how this feels like a 50&#39;s era movie, and having Godzilla as an evil force of nature that brings rampage, despair and destruction to the land feels so good man, that&#39;s how he started, and honestly, I prefer him that way"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,Japan in 1947: Things couldn&#39;t get any worse!<br><br>Godzilla:
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-05,"This might be the scariest Godzilla movie ever made. Godzilla looks really awesome, and the destruction scenes look great."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-06,"Just got back from the theater, it was amazing. So emotional, great soundtrack and acting. Tons of acting and even made me cry."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-10-08,"Not that there is ever a bad time to be a Godzilla fan, but oh my goodness what a time to be a Godzilla fan. <br><br>Godzilla will outlive us all."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-08,This is true Godzilla. Full circle. The classic returns. Godzilla won movies. It is astronomically impossible to explain how existentialy exited i feel for this. This is perfection.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-08,The way they made Gojira 1954s roar sound so menacing even now is insane.
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-04,"One of the best movies of the year, this should be a Oscar consideration I&#39;m so fucking serious..."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I love seeing this return to form for Godzilla. Pure hatred, pure vengeance. A wild animal lashing out in rage at all of humanity for the horrors of war."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,Seeing this on number 2 on trending with the most views within 15 hours makes me and a whole lot of Godzilla fans happy I bet
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-07,"Godzilla feels like a force of nature that is both the consequences of the atomic bomb and also the natural disasters that always hits Japan like earthquakes and tsunamis. It&#39;s well known that Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Now, this movie seems to be going back to his destructive roots as the wrath of nature since uranium and plutonium the main ingredients for nuclear bombs are both found in nature only to be transformed into a weapon by humans as shown in the Oppenheimer movie."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-10,This is the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"If we can‚Äôt get a Shin Godzilla sequel, this is easily the next best thing"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-06,"Im glad TOHO decided to reboot the series again. Shin was fantastic, but really could only stand on its own. This seems to be a return to form for the franchise."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I don‚Äôt normally see movies with subtitles in theaters‚Ä¶ but when I do, it‚Äôs GODZILLA! üî• LET‚ÄôS GOOOOOO!!!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-11-30,"I&#39;m on my way home from seeing it! Day One. So I won&#39;t say too much other than this: The human script, the visual sights and sounds and the monster action were altogether very awesome! As with Legendary&#39;s Godzilla 2014, this 2023 Toho movie ended with you wanting to see more, but the character of the monster was more true to the original movie&#39;s monster. The monster&#39;s look was about up there with that classic-faced 1964 version. It will be one of my top favorites."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I really hope this is as good as it looks. The music, the clips, the desperation in the quote ‚ÄúThat monster will never forgive us.‚Äù The implied, defeated spirit of the man being scorned: ‚ÄúEveryone is dead-‚Äú ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a disgrace!‚Äù To the stubborn will to carry on; ‚Äúfight and survive.‚Äù And, the undeniable imagery of Godzilla‚Äôs disastrous rise paralleling the atomic devastation of Japan. It legit tears me up."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I got chills watching this, it&#39;s the first time in recent memory that I recall genuine excitement for a movie"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,No one&#39;s gonna talk about how realistic that damn CGI is!? That train smashing made my jaw dropped. This is the Godzilla movie we needed so much!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-15,"Minami Hamabe is the cutest, and now she&#39;ll be remembered as the greatest Japanese actress of her generation, since this film is a timeless masterpiece and will be still watched in 30-40 years time."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"I think this is probably gonna be one of, if not THE most gruesome Godzilla movie of the entire franchise. You hardly see anyone getting injured in the old films, but in this trailer alone, you can easily spot like 30+ people just getting wrecked by the damage. It&#39;s insane. Also LOVE a new adaptation of Godzilla being a bad guy again. No crazy fights or anything supernatural or lore with other unique monsters. Just classic Godzilla causing ruthless chaos and destruction. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-10-07,"This looks exactly like the Godzilla movie I&#39;ve always wanted. I try not to get too excited for movies these days since so many are disappointing, but I can&#39;t help but be excited for this. Now please don&#39;t give too much away in endless trailers, let&#39;s keep some spectacle for the actual movie!"
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-26,"I love how this film looks like it&#39;s come full-circle back to the original film. If not an outright remake, it definitely feels like genuine homage. I&#39;m excited to see it."
Godzilla Minus One,2023-12-08,I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to TOHO for producing this masterpiece! I hope this success will enable you to continue on telling this story and I&#39;ll be waiting for it as a newly gain fan of yours!<br><br>Domo arigato!
Godzilla Minus One,2023-09-04,"At some point, we all can agree how TOHO is still pulling off the new movie to a whole new level, I&#39;m so down for what&#39;s coming!"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,I feel like any actor would be honored to be in a ghibli film
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"It has already been released in Spain, and I can tell you that you are not prepared for this masterpiece. It deserves to be seen in a movie theater"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-09,This movie is absolutely insane. Its like a combination of every Ghibli film and yet feels completely different
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"Just in the trailer alone you can see shades of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Totoro, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. It truly feels like this is the culmination of Miyazaki&#39;s life&#39;s work, and hopefully will be the shining masterpiece it seems."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,Rob Pattinson&#39;s voice acting is incredible. The direction for the english cast in Ghibli movies are always stellar.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-20,"I&#39;m a Japanese woman in my 40s living in Spain, and I just saw this movie last weekend. It was the first time that I could not stop crying after watching a movie, not just Ghibli movies, but all movies. It was a movie that deeply moved my heart. This is a masterpiece created by Hayao Miyazaki, who is 82 years old and is the same age as my father, with all his soul.<br> It contains a message for humanity. As you can see from the Japanese title, &quot;How do you guys live?&quot;, Hayao Miyazaki is asking, &quot;This is how I lived my life. How do you guys live your lives?&quot; <br><br>A number of prominent Japanese animation studios collaborated in the production of this work. It&#39;s a kind of repayment that shows respect and awe for what the 82-year-old Hayao Miyazaki has given us. <br>I don&#39;t know why I burst into tears after watching the movie, but I feel like it was out of respect for him and gratitude, saying, &quot;Thank you for showing me so many great movies since my childhood.&quot;<br><br>Unfortunately, this movie did not do well at the box office in Japan. It&#39;s a shame that people in Japan seem to be asking too much for ``correct answers&#39;&#39; from movies. For me, the correct interpretation is that this movie is &quot;art.&quot; What is important is what the viewer feels.<br><br>I&#39;m really happy that it&#39;s been highly rated overseas. The Academy Awards will be announced in January. The Academy Awards have fallen into commercialism, but could you please move those excectives of Hallywood who respect Hayao Miyazaki to action? <br><br>The last Academy Award for Hayao Miyazaki!!!!<br>------------------------------------------------<br>11/03/2024 <br>About 30 minutes ago, the winner of the 2024 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film was announced! Congratulations to Hayao Miyazaki!<br>After watching the Golden Globe Awards, British Academy Awards, and award trends in the past few months, and watching the several-minute video message from producer Suzuki and director Hayao Miyazaki that appeared on the Oscar website a few days ago, I was actually convinced that he would win the Academy Award. I sincerely respect and appreciate the efforts of 83-year-old my„ÄÄgrandfather! I&#39;m really happy! !"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,"This is IMO the most ambitious, and best, movie Hayao Miyazaki has made since Spirited Away. No one does it quite like him. It&#39;s just pure, cinematic magic that transports you to another world."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-08,"I have to remind myself of how grateful I am to see hayao miazaki films in theaters. He truly is of the last masters of his form. I will never gain the experience nor the understanding of why his films just have this sort of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù factor to them, but I am 100% certain that it‚Äôs there. That there is a sort of magic in his films that I can feel. Thank god that I got to live in the same time as the great hayao miazaki. It has a been a true honor to not have watched his films but to have experienced them. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie in theaters. To see it anywhere but on the biggest screen possible would be (to myself) a sin to the love of movies. People sometimes ask about certain pieces of art and say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make like they use too‚Äù or something along those lines, but I want you to know that this movie is one of those movies. There will never be a movie like the boy and the heron. It truly is the last movie of a bygone era of animated movies where animation had this much care and attention to the world itself. You will find movies that will imitate and maybe be inspired by its style but never find another that is THIS AUTHENTIC to its source. If I haven‚Äôt made it clear enough, I really do urge people to see this movie. <br><br>Edit:<br>Just saw the movie and I can confidently say that hayao miazaki still that greatness and that magic that‚Äôs in all of his movies. It was definitely his most personal and his most complex movie to date. It‚Äôs one of those movies that‚Äôs not easily digestible and may take 2 or more viewings to truly gain an understanding of what you saw. I‚Äôm going to see it again and try to see if I can get a better understanding of it entire. Also in every studio ghibli movie there is always that one moment where I‚Äôm watching it and i just look upon in wonder and awe and say ‚Äúwow‚Äù. This movie has those moments. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I said those words in a theater before. I know it kind of cliche to say this but DAMN IS THIS MOVIE BEAUTIFUL."

The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-04,The pure joy and warmth I get out of watching any Ghibli movie is undescribable. My fiance and I have watched the movies over a dozen times but we won&#39;t get tired. Thank you mother for showing me Kiki and Totoro at a young age. Your love sparks with every Ghibli scene. And thank you everyone at Studio Ghibli. You can&#39;t imagine the importance of your movies for my health.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,Pattinson as the Heron is ridiculous in all the best ways
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-10,Just saw this film. Was completely unprepared. The only way I can think to describe it is &quot;like a beautiful nightmare.&quot; One of the most deeply upsetting and deeply moving films I&#39;ve seen.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,The way a ghibli film will give me goosebumps every time is uncanny.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,The amount of people who think the heron is willem or mark is hilarious. Robert is just that good at transforming his voice apparently
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-19,"I absolutely love that Studio Ghibli is still doing Cel Animation for their movies, it makes it feel so organic and nostalgic."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,"All of Miyazaki&#39;s movies make me cry. They are just too damn beautiful. From Nausica, to this, I am never not amazed. I am so excited to watch this, and just grateful we all get another movie out of him."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-07,"Saw this today in Belgium, it&#39;s a masterpiece. It feels like a &quot;conclusion&quot; of sorts to both Spirited Away and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. You are not prepared how strange, creepy and beautiful this story is."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-08,"We‚Äôve just gotten home from watching this movie, what an absolute mind-blow. Incredibly beautiful and full of heart. Please go see this masterpiece for yourself."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"the animation is so damn clean, especially the fire scenes, words just cant express its pure beauty!!"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,Robert Pattinson as the Heron is unrecognizable!!! I can&#39;t wait to watch this
The Boy and the Heron,2024-11-02,"I am 60 years old. I saw a Ghibli movie for the first time when I was 20 years old. I am surprised that even at my age, I can be moved by a so-called animated movie.<br><br>I wanted to show my children the things I love, so when they were small, I bought the DVDs and sat in front of the TV with them many times.<br><br>Now that my son is an adult, he shows Ghibli movies to his children, that is, my grandchildren. Rather than showing them, he watches them with them. My grandchildren are still in kindergarten, so last month it was &quot;Totoro&quot; and this month it was &quot;Ponyo.&quot; When a Ghibli movie is on TV, I can&#39;t help but be glued to the screen and watch it with them, which is funny. Even though I&#39;ve seen the scenes many times, I can&#39;t help but be drawn in, laughing, feeling excited, and feeling sad.<br><br>My granddaughters will grow up someday and be old enough to watch &quot;How Do You Live?&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies.&quot; The sad scenes may make their hearts burst.<br><br>The reason why Ghibli films have a nostalgic sensibility and attract so many people is probably because they carefully portray primal human emotions and human warmth through intricate depictions.<br><br>ÁßÅ„ÅØ60Ê≠≥„Åß„Åô„ÄÇÂàù„ÇÅ„Å¶„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„ÇíË¶ã„Åü„ÅÆ„ÅØ20Ê≠≥„ÅÆÈ†É„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Åì„ÅÆÂπ¥„Å´„Å™„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„Çè„ÇÜ„Çã„Ç¢„Éã„É°Êò†Áîª„ÅßÊÑüÂãï„Åß„Åç„Çã„Å®„ÅØÈ©ö„Åç„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br><br>Ëá™ÂàÜ„ÅåÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Å™„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅØÂ≠ê‰æõÈÅî„Å´„ÇÇË¶ã„Åõ„Åü„ÅÑ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂ≠ê‰æõÈÅî„ÅåÂ∞è„Åï„ÅÑ„Å®„Åç„ÅØDVD„ÇíË≤∑„ÅÑ„ÄÅ‰ΩïÂ∫¶„ÇÇ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„ÅÆÂâç„Å´Â∫ß„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ<br><br>‰ªä„Åß„ÅØÂ§ß‰∫∫„Å´„Å™„Å£„ÅüÊÅØÂ≠ê„Åå„ÇÑ„ÅØ„Çä„Åù„ÅÆÂ≠ê‰æõ„ÄÅ„Å§„Åæ„Çä„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÅÆÂ≠´ÈÅî„Å´„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„ÇíË¶ã„Åõ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇË¶ã„Åõ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Çà„Çä‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´Ë¶ã„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åæ„Å†„ÄÅÂ≠´„ÅØÂπºÁ®öÂúíÂÖê„Å™„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂÖàÊúà„ÅØ„Äå„Éà„Éà„É≠„Äç„ÄÅ‰ªäÊúà„ÅØ„Äå„Éù„Éã„Éß„Äç„Åß„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅ„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Å´„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„Åå„ÅÜ„Å§„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„Å§„ÅÑÁßÅ„Åæ„Åß„Åù„ÅÆÁîªÈù¢„Å´„Åè„Åé‰ªò„Åë„Å´„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´Ë¶ãÂÖ•„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åã„Çâ„Åä„Åã„Åó„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ‰ΩïÂõû„ÇÇË¶ã„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÂ†¥Èù¢„Å™„ÅÆ„Å´„ÄÅ„Å§„ÅÑÂºï„ÅçËæº„Åæ„Çå„Å¶„ÄÅÁ¨ë„Å£„Åü„Çä„ÄÅ„Å©„Åç„Å©„Åç„Åó„Åü„Çä„ÄÅÊÇ≤„Åó„Åè„Å™„Å£„Åü„Çä„Åó„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br><br>„Åì„ÅÆÂ≠´Â®òÈÅî„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„Å§„ÅãÂ§ß„Åç„Åè„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ„ÄåÂêõ„Åü„Å°„ÅØ„Å©„ÅÜÁîü„Åç„Çã„Åã„Äç„ÇÑ„ÄåÁÅ´ÂûÇ„Çã„ÅÆÂ¢ì„Äç„ÇíË¶ã„Çå„ÇãÂπ¥ÈΩ¢„Å´„Å™„Çã„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„ÄÇÊÇ≤„Åó„ÅÑÂ†¥Èù¢„Åß„ÅØËÉ∏„ÅåÂºµ„ÇäË£Ç„Åë„Åù„ÅÜ„Å´„Å´„Å™„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇ<br><br>„Åù„Çì„Å™„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„Åå„Å™„Çì„Å†„ÅãÊáê„Åã„Åó„Åè„ÄÅ„Åù„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅÂ§ö„Åè„ÅÆ‰∫∫„ÇíÂºï„Åç‰ªò„Åë„Çã„ÅÆ„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰∫∫Èñì„Å®„Åó„Å¶„ÅÆÂéüÂàù„ÅÆÊÑüÊÉÖ„ÄÅ‰∫∫Èñì„ÅÆÊ∏©„Åã„Åï„ÇíÁ¥∞„ÇÑ„Åã„Å™ÊèèÂÜô„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´‰∏ÅÂØß„Å´Êò†„ÅóÂá∫„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åã„Çâ„Åß„ÅØ„Å™„ÅÑ„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åã„ÄÇ"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,Anyone else finding it very strange how we can‚Äôt tell that that‚Äôs Robert Pattinson voicing the Heron? You‚Äôd imagine Williem Dafoe or Mark Hamil were the ones voicing him. Very good voice acting range from Pattinson there.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-13,I lived in Japan from 1985 to 1988. Near my apartment there was a movie theatre that specialized in Anime films. I got to see Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind at that theatre. I fell in love with his films from that point on. I have enjoyed watching many Japanese anime films (the TV anime is spotty on the quality) but there is something about Miyazaki Hayao&#39;s work that never fails to touch my soul. I learn something about life and myself every time I see one of his films. I was a young man when I saw that first film and now I&#39;m 60. Unbelievable how fast time has passed. Just glad I&#39;m still here to see one more of his movies.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-11,"Absolutely loved this masterpiece. Mahito&#39;s coming of age journey, his love for his mother and Natsuko, the wisdom of the grand uncle, how the film is left open to various interpretations, the homage to previous Ghibli films, and of course, the stunning animation."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,Pattinson&#39;s voice from being a Cringe Vampire to Batman to Grey Heron üò≥<br>Him and Suda Masaki impressed meü•≤
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"They weren&#39;t lying. After watching it two times, even though I still think Spirited away and Princess mononoke are masterpieces, this movie feels like his Magnum Opus."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,I never thought I&#39;d see another Miyazaki film released in my lifetime. I&#39;m so exited to see this one! legit brought me to tears.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-08,&quot;You see this world....there&#39;s more work to be done&quot;. I was already getting goosebumps due to the animation and editing. This line just brought everything to a climax
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-08,I saw the film on IMAX in LA with the original Japanese voice track with subtitles and I was blown away.  I can&#39;t begin to express the depth of this film.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,Only a ghibli trailer could have me tearing up even when I&#39;ve just got a vague idea of what the movie will be about üíïü•∫
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"My God, Pattinson is doing actual voice acting. Didn&#39;t expect that from a celebrity."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-19,"I&#39;ve rewatched this movie three times now in both subbed and dub. I really wanted to click with it on my first watch, but left the theater like a lot of people here, feeling a mixture of a bit of boredom, confusion, lost, disappointment, and ambiguity. It was kind of hard for me to accept tbh. But, like The Wind Rises, I was lost while watching, but started to really appreciate it more as I pondered and solved certain aspects of the film. I gave it two more watches with other family members, and each time, I caught on to more of the symbolism, and probably most importantly, I had a new perspective on the pacing and plot. By the third watch, I was able to just sit back and enjoy every moment, and it&#39;s now competing for my favorite Ghibli film. It&#39;s Miyazaki&#39;s most introspective film by far, and combines the mature and mellow tones of something like The Wind Rises with the childhood adventure of his earliest works.<br><br>I think the biggest killer of this movie for many fans will be expectations, followed by familiarity with Miyazaki. Based on the English trailer and name I saw, I was expecting a fast and simple adventure. It&#39;s not that. This film is slow paced, meticulous, and leaves a lot unexplained. The first half of the movie is essentiall all build up. We&#39;ve also all gotten used to movies explaining each and every little thing to us and following a formulaic plot format that we all know. Miyazaki doesn&#39;t do that here at all. Characters don&#39;t explain their actions to anyone. He gives you clues to most of the puzzles but leaves it unsolved for the audience. Also, there is no static quest or objective for most of the movie. Just like life, Mahito&#39;s position and goal are always moving. Some might also feel like the transitions are rushed, but they are best described as fluid. Scenes move from one to another in a way not typical of most films. Lastly, the more familiar you are with where Miyazaki is as a creator, the more you can understand the themes. This movie is a farewell letter to his family, friends, coworkers, and fans more than anything else as he prepares us to watch his work disappear when he dies.<br><br>There are also some cultural stuff not explained. For instance, it is taboo for men to enter a woman&#39;s birthing room, especially in 1940s Japanese culture."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"Full English stacked is just like candy, this is insane to see how some came back and do it justice every time‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,"Studio Ghibli&#39;s films have been close to my heart since I was very young. Such emotion, such comfort, such joy they have brought me. To see yet another film from the masters on the big screen, and a new story inspired by such a classic book, I can only imagine how incredible it will be in it&#39;s entirety."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-11,"Miyazaki has done it again; I have the upmost respect for this man, this legend has truly left a mark on every generation alive to witness his works."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,"Idk what is it with Miyazki&#39;s films, but even a trailer for them makes me cry like a baby."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"What a stacked cast. And wow, that animation is clean as hell, can definitely see why it took six years to make this film. Great job everyone, can&#39;t wait to see this."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-09,"I just watched this in theaters, it was the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, it spoke to my soul and changed how I viewed life as a whole."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"This is a pretty interesting trailer. The characters look interesting, the animation is incredible, and voice cast is stacked. But I can‚Äôt believe Miyazaki is back directing his 12th feature film at the age of 83. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. In terms of animated films, did he directed more movies than other animators?"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-10,"Wow, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve gotten goosebumps from a preview like this. I&#39;m glad every time Miyazaki-san comes out of retirement to make &quot;just one more movie&quot; because it&#39;s such a treat to live in his worlds. ü•∞"
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-09,This was a good one. I was so grateful to be able to see a new Miyazaki film in theaters. Never thought that would happen.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-16,"The trailer alone made me shed a tear; the voice acting is impactful as well, just pure emotion put into it"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-21,I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one that feels like this but there&#39;s something about the films made by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli that now any time I see their style of animation it instantly fills me with joy
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-08,I‚Äôm so happy this got nominated from the Golden Globe! Truly deserves it trophy üèÜ
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,Robert Pattinson may be the best voice actor of our generation.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,Robert Pattinson&#39;s voice as the Heron is so eerie i almost thought it was dubbed by Willem Dafoe.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-11,"Just saw it in theaters with my bf and kid as we‚Äôre all massive ghibli fans and we had our minds blown. this movie already means a lot to me, even more so than spirited away which has been a part of my heart ever since I was a young kid."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,There is no mistaking this for anything other than a true Miyazaki piece. I hope it does splendidly in the USA.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"I went to Japan a month ago and last thing i did was see this movie in japanese (i don&#39;t know Japanese). Even without speaking the language, the movie stunned me. I can&#39;t wait to see it again here in the States, and get the full experience this time!"
The Boy and the Heron,2024-03-12,And this film won the Oscars last night. <br>Miyazaki is truly a legend
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,"I dont understand how The Heron is Robert Pattinson? I cant hear his voice at all, its insane. He has so much range"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,Can&#39;t wait to see this one. Would have never guessed that voice was Robert Pattinson either
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-06,"Took my mother to see this last night. My mother is a burn survivor who got caught in a house fire a few years before I was born, and got 3rd degree burns on 99% of her body. To say this film struck a chord with me would be an understatement. After seeing this once, certainly still not my favourite Ghibli, but I don&#39;t know if I could but into words how I felt sharing this experience with my mother."

The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-04,It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôve done something I always love seeing - taking the techniques learned to animate specialized scenes and apply them moving forward. Anyone who saw Suzume knows what I mean. Regardless of director/production it‚Äôs not only smart practice but makes the entire set of movies feel cohesive stylistically!
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-13,god this was absolutely incredible. i genuinely have no words. it captured the magic of all the classic ghibli movies whilst maintaining its own identity. its everything we could have ever wanted.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,This feels like classic Hayao. Can‚Äôt wait to see it. Ghibli movies have a certain quiet magic and they weave a spell over the viewer than other animation can‚Äôt.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-15,"imo, this is his top 3 film. So subtle, so many layers, so character and emotionally driven. Part coming of age, part auto biographical. It&#39;s the kind of film that stays with me for a very long time, like Satoshi Kon&#39;s films."
The Boy and the Heron,2024-11-25,This movie is the culmination of everything that Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki learned over the years in making films. It&#39;s a total and complete Masterpiece!
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-08,"In Italy it has been released only this week and what a masterpiece it is, it&#39;s the coronation of one of the most incredible career in the industry, it may not be the greatest Ghibli movie of them all but the fact that it is a movie both about death(the end pf a life)and about the author himself facing the end of its career deeply moves anyone who has watched it; and as obvious as it may be, I have to say it, Joes Hisaishi really outdid himself, listening to &quot;The last smile&quot; with headphones moved me to tears."
The Boy and the Heron,2024-02-05,"I feel like Miyazaki is the only human on Earth who truly understands what animation is about. If you can do anything with animation, go fucking nuts. Show me something crazy. We need more creative people like him."
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-08,And this film just won the 2024 Golden Globe for <i>Best Animated Film.</i><br><br><b>Update 3/10/2024:</b><br>Now it just won the 2024 Oscar for <i>Best Animated Film.</i>
The Boy and the Heron,2024-03-11,The boy and the heron was the Oscar for best animated feature tonight let&#39;s gooooo
The Boy and the Heron,2024-07-13,"This movie is autobiographical. It&#39;s like delving into Hayo Miyazaki&#39;s long life feelings, thoughts and experiences. Miyazaki tries to tell us that in death, there is life. The line between life and death may be less distinct than we think. If we use our imagination we can find the real beauty in this world. Everyone must see this movie. It&#39;s been a month since i lost my father to cancer and this movie resonates with me so deeply. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I feel like this is a farewell from Miyazaki to all of us,a last gift with rich symbolism for us to unlock. ‚ù§"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-10,i‚Äôm actually so sad that people grow old and have to leave this world‚Ä¶ miyazaki deserves the world for putting a great memory in most children‚Äôs childhood- including mine. idk what i‚Äôm gonna do now that the boy and heron is his last film üòî ghibli will always be in my heart
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-04,"This has to be one of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen. The music, the imagery, the voice acting, it‚Äôs all so perfect. I haven‚Äôt been this excited to see a movie in years."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-24,"I saw this last week. I&#39;m a 35 year old combat vet from the OIF/OEF wars. Miyazaki has always brought me some strange of peace. And I love it.  Makes me feel so normal to know someone as brilliant as he, seems to understand the brains struggle"
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-08,So happy to see probably Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s Last Waltz! And it was such an amazing film for his entire legacy. Hopefully he&#39;s still got room for one more as this was magically fantastic!
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-09,I don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s about but I&#39;m tearing up just watching the trailer. I can&#39;t wait. No one can do it quite like Ghibli.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-04,"There are a lot of references to Miyazaki&#39;s past works.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=27"">0:27</a> Mononoke<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=52"">0:52</a> Ponyo<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=60"">1:00</a> Future Boy Conan<br> <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=62"">1:02</a> Kiki&#39;s house<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=64"">1:04</a> Howl (Calcifer?)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> Whisper of the heart (possibly)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=67"">1:07</a> Animal Treasure Island (maybe)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=93"">1:33</a> Laputa<br><br>The one with the boat is especially obvious."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-06,Studio Ghibli will always have that effect on me wherein you want to be in their world everytime you watched their movies.<br>so excited to see it back with this kind of animation ‚ù§
The Boy and the Heron,2024-03-10,Amazing news! The Boy and the Heron won the Academy Award for Best Animated FeatureüéÜüèÜüéâüéä!
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-17,I was not sure what I saw when I left a theater but the impression it left was something I rarely felt in my life after a movie... and it comes back with the same intensity every time I think about the movie.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-18,"This film, made by an old master 82years old, is full of youthful, fresh energy, like the work by a talented young director. I went to the movie theater thinking it&#39;s must be his last fight, but within the first three minutes of the movie, I was completely knocked out and thrown over the ring. In effect, this will be Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s last work. But I can&#39;t believe he would quit making movies. I&#39;m sure he already has new ideas swirling around in his head."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-09,What a gift it‚Äôs been to watch Mr.Miyazaki‚Äôs movies in my life.
The Boy and the Heron,2024-03-12,"Congratulations, Miyazaki-san, on winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature!"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-20,"I watched the making-of documentary of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s latest work, &quot;The Boy and the heron&quot; . After viewing the documentary, I felt that the theme of the movie is a requiem for Miyazaki&#39;s close friend, the renowned anime film director Isao Takahata, known for &quot;Grave of the Fireflies.&quot; Takahata, who was Miyazaki&#39;s senior by five years, taught many things to a young Miyazaki. For Miyazaki, Takahata was a mentor, a parent, and a rival. Takahata passed away in 2018, and Miyazaki struggled to accept his death for a long time. The boy depicted in &quot;The Boy and the heron&quot; represents Miyazaki, and the great uncle is Takahata. The farewell to the great uncle is the central theme of the film, portraying Miyazaki finally breaking free from the spell of Takahata and depicting his own liberation."

The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-04,"A tool to heal our collective souls - a beautiful and accurate way to describe most Miyazaki movies. He stands apart from other Japanese storytellers who are usually obsessed with tragedy and loss (something to do with the history of Japan perhaps), in that his tales almost always end with the triumph of hope and love."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-09,"Just watched it, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve seen before. It was  visually stunning,  strange yet inviting. I&#39;m so happy that I had the chance to watch a studio ghibli movie in a theater. ‚ù§"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-10,"Watching the trailer with my partner and we fell silent and just tears. Moved because I feel the goodbye, I see the tribute, and there is more in this world to be done. Thank you Hayao."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,seen it at a film fest a couple of weeks back and it&#39;s easily in the top 5 of Miyazaki&#39;s movies for me. Wonderful movie!
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-21,To say that I‚Äôm impressed by Robert‚Äôs performance in this is a VAST understatement. I‚Äôm actually blown away tbh. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-03,As a Japanese who have watched this film 10 times in Japan. This is masterpiece
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-14,"I watched this movie in theater in  German which I&#39;m not fluent at all; however, I felt like I could understand most of it since I lost my mother and had my own herons to deal with. But I cried and cried while watching this great film"
The Boy and the Heron,2024-11-10,"Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs work has been in my life for as long as I can remember. When I go on a walk, I get glimpses of these moments in his creation. In terms of this film‚Ä¶ to one person, it‚Äôs a weird, confusing masterpiece of an animation; to a Ghibli fan, it‚Äôs a culmination with moments of every piece of heart in their previous work, and to everyone, this film is the cure to pain and war."
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-08,Just got back from this movie. I only learned of its existence last night. I didn‚Äôt see the trailer at all. I went in totally blind. It was so much fun to just watch this amazing story unfold. Can‚Äôt wait to see it again!
The Boy and the Heron,2024-03-12,Congrats to the team for winning best animated film of the year! Well deserved for sure
The Boy and the Heron,2024-01-15,"Miyazakis ability to showcase the beauty of the world through animation is crazy. <br><br>The way the colors, shadows etc it feels like being there. Like a distant memory. Its like you been in that exact place before and know How the wind and temperature feels"
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-04,omg plsss i&#39;m so ready yes ty release already „Åæ„Å£„Å¶„Çã„Çà üò≠

The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-02,I need to see the voice recording sessions of Robert Pattinson doing the Heron voice.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-12-10,This is the first time I&#39;ve been genuinely excited for a movie in a long time.
The Boy and the Heron,2023-11-13,"I&#39;ve seen it yesterday and let me tell you, this is not just one of Miyazaki&#39;s greatest films to date, it is simply one of year&#39;s best films period. The storytelling, cinematography, pacing, all remarkable, a true work of art. I did see it in its original japanese dubbing, and that&#39;s how I recommend it to be seen."

Never Let Go,2024-05-16,It‚Äôs interesting because you don‚Äôt know if there are actually malevolent creatures in the woods or if the mother (Halle) is suffering from extreme psychosis and is keeping her boys tethered to the house for no reason.
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,when you hear an old song or see a record player.....you know its gonna be a horror movie.

From B.A.P.S to Catwoman to Losing Isiah to X-men to Dorothy Dandridge to Monsters Ball to Gothika to The call to Bruises etc none of the roles are the same! She‚Äôs extraordinary!! She deserves more recognition! Seriously! Side note I‚Äôd love to see her in a film with Denzel!
Never Let Go,2024-05-20,I love seeing Halle back in these type of suspense stories. I feel that genre is one of her biggest strength as an actress. I would love if she does a TV series full of suspense/thriller.
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,Had the pleasure of working on this!!!
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,Halle Berry is gonna be incredible in Never Let Go!

Never Let Go,2024-05-20,I see the plot going down as the kids and the audience start off believing there are entities. Then the movie will make us start to believe the mom is just crazy. Then at the end it turns out she&#39;s not crazy.
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,She is one of my favorite actresses. She has got talent for sure.

Never Let Go,2024-08-16,Halle Berry. This woman is a legend üî•
Never Let Go,2024-05-17,"Why do I feel this is in the same universe as Tethered (2022)? In Tethered, Solomon, a young blind man, lives alone in the North Carolina woods with a rope that helps guide him home after his parents seemingly died or left him to fend for himself with an unknown monster. Then, one day, Hank, another human, comes into his life, and things confuse Solomon. All his life, he‚Äôs ever known to depend on the rope. Never Let Go has the same premise. Is Hank, the husband of Halle Berry‚Äôs mother, going crazy after he left and never came back? Is her family falling to the same symptom that plagued Solomon‚Äôs? It would be cool if it is."
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,"Nice!! - the song at the beginning is OUR LOVE by the Starr Sisters, written by Al Hazan."
Never Let Go,2024-05-16,Always enjoyed seeing Halle on screen. Looking forward to seeing this. Hopefully it&#39;s good.
Never Let Go,2024-06-19,"i saw a short movie where a mother was raising her single son in a cabin in the woods exactly lie this.  he was tied to the house, never allowed to leave, she would go out with her own rope, to hunt for him.  one day she never came back.  he ended up leaving the house through starvation and discovered his mother was a local nutjob and no one even knew he existed. she was pregnant again and just abandoned her teen son to go start again<br><br>edit:  the tone of the movie hinted that horror existed in the woods around his house but the further he travelled the more it was revealed to be normal wildlife and phenomena that he had been TOLD were terrible monsters, like the deer who would rip him to pieces with their antlers etc. and the trees sway in the breeze were actually trying to reach out and strangle him to death.<br>This movie really reminds me of that short, i wonder if it was inspired by it.  i mean, the cabin, the woods, the rope, basically the same premise."
Never Let Go,2024-05-18,"So the mother is the Cult!? Never let go, never doubt, never question, never leave me, never see the other world."

Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"I remember Dastmalchian since the days of ‚Äúthat creepy dude from The Dark Knight‚Äù. And now, after so many years, after small but memorable roles, like the Joker gang leader and Polkadotman, Dastmalchian finally has a  leading role!"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"I saw this at a film festival last year. David Dastmalchian absolutely kills it in this, and the 70s talk show angle is incredibly well done. Don&#39;t miss out on it!"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,So glad to see David Dastmalchian in a lead role finally. He&#39;s a beast in every role he played. Talented is an understatement.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"I love a premise such as this. Not quite &quot;found footage&quot;, not quite &quot;tv exorcism&quot; but still unique enough for me to be excited to see this. Hell.yeah"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,David Dastmalchian in a lead role! So excited!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"This looks like it will be an interesting take on a villain protagonist. A guy who is not actively trying to hurt people, but IS willing to endanger countless people for the sake of higher ratings."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"If it&#39;s got David Dastmalchian, you know it&#39;s gonna be good."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,I really like the attention to detail paid to the era this takes place in. I love it when it looks authentic like that.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,The 70s feel makes it better
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,The fact that even the credits and trailer look like the 70‚Äôs is the best
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"This is perfect retro-charm, tributing the best era of horror films."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,David Dastmalchian is continually becoming one of my favorite actors of our generation
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,Whoever is making movie trailers lately. <br>Thank you!<br>This looks absolutely amazing and not just for the movie premise. This trailer is top notch too. <br>Kudos to the editors!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-08,"Echoing everyone‚Äôs comments, it‚Äôs so awesome so see David Dastmalchians career continue to ascend! He‚Äôs such a phenomenal actor"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,March 22nd is no longer just another day....I&#39;ll be looking for this!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-09,"I LOVE how real this looks as if it was actually filmed in the 70s, the SOUND design of this is stunning, the fact this didnt even show much of the film is amazing. Cant wait to see this. Some of the horror scenes remind me of ‚ÄúScanners‚Äù IYKYK. They really made this feel like a Biopic, so realistic."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,I saw this about a year ago at an event. It&#39;s a fantastic film... I&#39;ve been anticipating it&#39;s release merely so I can see how this thing blows the entire world away when they see it. It&#39;s original and ridiculously arresting. Everyone&#39;s in for a treat
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,David Dastmalchian is the special reason for wanting to watch this very interesting film.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,Network is one of the greatest films ever made. It&#39;s good to see a new movie exploring similar territory with a new angle.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-08,I saw this at a test screening in September 2022! Everyone NEEDS to go see this in the theater! It cannot be missed!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"This looks like a full length version of a VHS short. I&#39;m into it, especially seeing Dastmalchian in the lead"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-13,&quot; Good too see you again Jack&quot; love the foreshadowing Jack clearly made a deal with the actual devil too do this in some way. Remember the devil always collects his debts
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"Dastmalchian is so versatile, and this movie looks awesome!"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-16,"just saw it at alamo drafthouse tonight, so much spooky fun. They made it really like an authentic 70s show."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"Reminds me of that BBC programme Ghostwatch in 1992 . It was a halloween special and showed a woman who claims her house has a poltergeist. No one knew it was fake and it actually traumatized people, even a teenage boy killed himself. The BBC got sued over it."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-15,"David Dastmalchian literally looks like People&#39;s Temple cult leader, Jim Jones. The resemblance is uncanny. Someone please cast him as Jim Jones in the movie based on the Jonestown massacre."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-11,"Duuude, David as a lead?! Finally! Dude is so underappreciated!"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-16,"As a 44-year-old man who loves horror/scary movie aesthetic but refuses to watch them because I&#39;ll scream like a little girl, this looks fantastic."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-11,This is the first film... in a long time... that I am choosing to watch <b>solely</b> on the merits of the trailer.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"I&#39;m so excited for this movie. The concept alone is a major win, and we have great actors to top it all off."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-16,"I hope it does great, not only is it well reviewed, but David Dastmalchian has been hammering away in quality movies for over a decade, and now has a leading role."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,Wonderful to see David Dastmalchian in a starring role like this! And I love the 70s aesthetic.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-10,Man its the first time in my life that a trailer made a chill go down my spine
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,Polka-Dot Man was my favorite character in The Suicide Squad and that movie is packed with good characters. David Dastmalchian is deserving of a leading role and I‚Äôm excited to watch this movie
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-17,so glad David D is getting his (well deserved!) lead spotlight
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,Im patiently waiting...im a 70s baby and this take me back to my childhood..
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-09,Dastmalchian is one of those actors that never seem to have bad roles but still have a small-scale fanbase comapred to others (similar to Walton Goggins and Steven Yeun)
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,I miss the creepy narrator.<br><br>But y&#39;know what? I&#39;m STOKED to see this.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-09,This movie is perfection. Did an early screening during LIFF in the Netherlands and was hyped and attached from the first second.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-09,I remember when this was advertised back in October of 1977! But I didn‚Äôt watch it back then I was tuned into NBC to watch The Johnny Carson Show and the later on watched Tom Synder afterwards.
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"Finally seeing him in a spotlight role, damn, it looks so good. üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç"
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,Mr. Dastmalchian FULLY DESERVES to step into lead roles! Excited to see this!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,David Dastmalchian in a lead?! YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-10,Thank you for making a movie trailer that doesn‚Äôt completely give away the movie
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,As I was watching the trailer I kept forgetting that it was a movie! LOL I thought it was an actual TV show... THAT IS HOW REALISTIC IT FEELS!!!!

Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"IAN BLISS? I haven&#39;t heard that name in years. I am still fond of his Agent Smith impression in The Matrix Sequels, it was terrific."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-11,"David Dastmalchian is so good, he disappears into every role he plays. I‚Äôm so ready for this."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,After seeing the teaser i was so happy to find this in my feed. Excited!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-19,I haven&#39;t been this excited for a film in like three years!
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,Finally something original
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-06,"Premise reminds me of BBC&#39;s Ghostwatch climax, albeit more explicit."
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-21,Gosh love the lead actor and the 70‚Äôx vibe ‚ù§
Late Night with the Devil,2024-03-07,"When David Dastmalchian wins, we all win!"

Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-08,I didn&#39;t realize how much I craved this sort of movie until now. The vibe is SOOOO comforting. Halloweentown mixed with Sabrina the Teenage Witch and more. I&#39;m so excited for this.
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-04,"I love it, it is like a 80s love letter to all the good Sci-Fi Horror and  Comedy adventure flicks we grew up with"
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-04,"I like it. Fells like a combo of Edward Scissor Hands, My Boyfriend‚Äôs back and Warm Bodies."
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-14,"Saw this trailer last night when watching Mean Girls, I was hella surprised seeing Liza Sobreano sharing the big screen with Kathryn Newton and Cole Sprouse.  I‚Äôm honestly so proud seeing how far she‚Äôs come esp since I used to watch her in teleseryes (Filipino soap operas) all the time.  üáµüá≠ hopefully I get to see more Filipino actors/actresses branching out and doing more Hollywood films!"
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-09,The 80s vibes are iconic. Why the hell has a movie like this not been made in ages? Or at least been mainstream? I‚Äôll definitely go out to the theaters to see this. It looks campy and goofy in the best way possible
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-09,So excited to see Cole sprouse back on the screen. Watching his growth as an actor from suite life to now is exciting to see! ‚ù§
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-04,Liza Soberano is finally on the Hollywood screen!!! üéâ
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-05,I live for the 80s aesthetics. They did such a great job especially with the hairstyles.

Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-04,Im rooting for Zelda Williams!!!
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-05,"This film looks phenomenal. Everyone is mentioning other movies to which this one is a kind of love letter (Edward Scissorhands, My Boyfriend‚Äôs Back, Warm Bodies), and I completely agree. However, one classic film it reminds me of that I‚Äôve not yet seen anyone mention, is Heathers!"
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-16,Cannot wait to see this! Cole looks like a young Edward Scissorhands here! And it&#39;s giving Heathers meets Tim Burton vibes! LOVE!!
Lisa Frankenstein,2024-01-05,Im so proud of you Liza Soberano the Filipino Actress for her first International Recognition Movie.

Piece by Piece,2024-06-06,I really hope they gave Kendrick the shorter Lego legs like Yoda lmao. I like how they made Snoop tall to be accurate.

Piece by Piece,2024-06-17,"as a music producer and a huge fan of lego this is a collaboration I would never have expected , this is great"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Jason Reitman wasn‚Äôt kidding. This really is a, in his words, ‚Äúthriller comedy‚Äù and time itself is the villain."
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,I&#39;m seated. The theater employees are scared and asking me to leave because &quot;the film isn&#39;t out yet&quot; but I&#39;m simply too seated.
Saturday Night,2024-08-11,"I kinda can‚Äôt get over the Chevy Chase casting. ‚ÄúOh, is this an ensemble?‚Äù line tells you everything you need to know about him at that time."

Saturday Night,2024-08-08,The Chevy Chase actor is spot on
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Everybody‚Äôs talking about the Chevy actor but whoever that is playing Belushi could be his grandson, insane resemblance."

Saturday Night,2024-08-08,How jealous is EVERY SNL cast member that someone get to do a Lorne impression for a whole movie??
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Having Jim Henson mention what Michael O‚Äô Donoughe did to a Big Bird toy because he (O‚Äô Donoughe) hated writing for the SNL Muppets is the kind of detail that makes me want to see this movie!<br>Edit: This is the most likes I‚Äôve ever gotten on a YouTube comment, thanks everybody!"
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"I didn&#39;t realize until now how young they all were back then, Lorne included. <br><br>They really were a bunch of kids that invented something from scratch and changed history."
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Dylan O&#39;Brien as Dan Aykroyd is BRILLIANT casting.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Everyone mentions Chevy Chase and don&#39;t realize John Belushi himself apparently came back from the dead for this
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,Gotham‚Äôs Riddler as Chevy Chase is PERFECTION
Saturday Night,2024-08-29,The Lorne Michaels actor is perfect casting. He replicates the exact body language and presentation while still feeling like he‚Äôs not trying to look like someone else.
Saturday Night,2024-08-12,Matthew Rhys as George Carlin looks awesome ‚Äî didn‚Äôt expect that casting
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9O_tl5Npk&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> well it‚Äôs nice to know they‚Äôre depicting Chevy accurately"

Saturday Night,2024-09-10,"This will be fun to watch. I was a young kid when I first watched SNL with the original cast. RIP Gilda, Belushi, and all the other brilliant comedians we&#39;ve lost on that show. Long live SNL."
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"I was just a toddler when the show first aired, but as I grew older I watched re-runs of the early seasons and I think since at least the early 80s my parents allowed me to stay up to watch it live. I am so excited to see this."
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"For me being just a kid up late, this show was that moment I felt my life change. I learned that I liked weird and dark humor. The original show also is what pulled me through what was going to be a very rough, dark period in my life. I&#39;m looking forward to watching this."
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,Obsessed with casting. Everyone studied and no one&#39;s a caricature.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Finn Wolfhard as Kenneth the page is AMAZING casting
Saturday Night,2024-09-08,"As someone who grew up with these guys, it&#39;s tough to wrap my head around the actors playing them. I saw the longer trailer in a theater tonight and was really thrown for a loop, although the actors playing Belushi, Gilda, and Carlin were clear.  But I&#39;d love to see this and I&#39;m praying to God that the film does everyone justice."
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,The actor portraying Garret Morris appears more times in this trailer than the real Garret Morris did during the first season of SNL üòÅ
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,The dude playing John Belushi looks spot on!
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"This feels like The Bear, Disaster Artist and Birdman in just one movie"

Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"I remember watching the first show as a Freshman in 1975 in my college dorm TV lounge...<br><br>They had to call it &quot;Saturday Night&quot; because Howard Cosell already had &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for his ABC variety show.  They picked up &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after that show got cancelled and off the air.<br><br>Note that the cold open close line has never changed.  It&#39;s STILL, &quot;LIVE, from New York, it&#39;s SATURDAY NIGHT!&quot;"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Its so cool that this has a bunch of up and coming actors too like finn, the guy from the fabelmans, and rachel sennott from bodies bodies bodies, it kinda reflects how the ppl on snl were just starting out at the time"

Saturday Night,2024-08-09,But Nick Braun doing Jim Henson is so spot on!!!!!
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Stumbled across the show premiere night in 1975. The bit that sold me and had me watching for the next two years was from someone who wasn&#39;t even a regular. Andy Kaufman&#39;s &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; riff was like nothing I&#39;d ever seen before.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Every day im reminded that Chevy chase was just playing himself in everything
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,Can&#39;t wait to see this movie. Almost 50 years of Saturday Night Live. I&#39;m gonna love Ella Hunt&#39;s performance as the late Gilda Radner. ‚ù§
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"I have family friends that have been working at 8H seemingly forever. Their father is the lead stagehand for that studio, the show does not happen without them. Hope they give him and his crew some props in this."
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"Well, this is a MUST see! It&#39;s about time someone made a movie about this!!!"

Saturday Night,2024-08-08,Cousin Greg sounding just like Cousin Greg
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,This might be one of the best put together trailers I&#39;ve ever seen
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,It&#39;s AMAZING that Dylan O&#39;Brien is playing Dan Aykroyd.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"To me, what really stands out is how Gabriel LaBelle (who is playing the young Lorne Michaels) has already played the younger versions of 2 iconic figures already (Michaels and of course a young Steven Spielberg in THE FABELMANS (directed by Spielberg himself))."
Saturday Night,2024-08-18,"It‚Äôs such a plus to have Dylan O‚ÄôBrien being in it, let alone playing Dan Akroyd. Can‚Äôt wait to see his impersonation of him"
Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"I&#39;ve used one of those lines for years when I approach a deadline.  We don&#39;t start the show because we&#39;re ready, we start it because it&#39;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9O_tl5Npk&amp;t=690"">11:30</a>."

Saturday Night,2024-08-09,"Everyone&#39;s talking about Chevy Chase, but can talk about how accurate the John Belushi actor looks?"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Being my favorite original cast member, whoever plays Dan Aykroyd does an amazing job."
Saturday Night,2024-08-10,Got to admit the original SNL in 1975 was the best and will always be. Those faux commercials really got me...I had no idea they were part of the SNL sketches. That era was and still is the funniest and will always be.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Hey, has anyone other than myself actually seen the first aired episode.  I feel like it makes this whole trailer even better!  Especially the George Carlin, and Henson bits!"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"This actually looks really good! All the actors look to be spot on with who they&#39;re playing, especially Cory Michael Smith as Chevy Chase!"

People will always quote &quot;I live in a van down by the river!&quot; or  &quot;We are two wild and crazy guys&quot; or &quot;Talk amongst yourselves. I‚Äôll give you a topic‚Ä¶&quot;"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,The cowbell in the soundtrack is a nice touch üêÑüîî

Saturday Night,2024-08-08,I‚Äôm using that line next time I fall over.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"If he keeps at it, Cooper will eventually win an Oscar just like his papa :&#39;)"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"I have been a huge SNL fan since Season 38, and I love everything thing about it, from the cold opening with ‚ÄúLive from New York! I&#39;ts Saturday Night!‚Äù to the monologue, to Weekend Update, the various cast members and Guest Hosts they had over the years,  and to see a movie about the first episode of Saturday Night? It‚Äôs going to be flantastic!‚Ä¶ What I&#39;m being told the world is fantastic, not flantastic! Sorry, never mind!"
Saturday Night,2024-08-11,Finally... a movie I am actually looking forward to about a show I used to love but have not watched in decades.
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Willem Dafoe just keeps working doesn&#39;t he??<br>Not complaining, love me some Dafoe!!"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"I remember being 16 &amp; and my older brother and I were so excited for this show! It was live and from New York (we are both native New Yorkers) Our parents told us to turn down the volume of the TV, they were sleeping lol"
Saturday Night,2024-08-10,Chevy Chase played by Gotham&#39;s Riddler is AMAZING
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"Post credits scene: Lorne Michaels hails a cab at an airport in Chicago. He arrives in front of a desolate Wrigley Field very late at night. No one around except for a shadowy figure sitting on a bench. He approaches the bench - without hesitation ‚ÄúChevy is out. What do you say?‚Äù The figure stands up ‚ÄúHello Lorne. I think we missed the game.‚ÄùLorne cracks a pathetic smirk. ‚ÄúBill‚Ä¶ People go to the zoo and they like the lion because it&#39;s scary, and the bear because it&#39;s intense, but the monkey makes people laugh.‚Äù<br>A young Bill Murray walks into the cold Chicago air, into the light and says‚Ä¶<br><br>‚ÄúCall me Billy.‚Äù"
Saturday Night,2024-08-08,"I was already sold based on the casting, but the trailer further solidifies this as one of my most anticipated films of the year. Cast looks spot-on."
Saturday Night,2024-09-12,"There actually is an irony to Jason Reitman being the director. Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters) was his dad who was from Canada and he worked with many Canadian actors who got their start on SCTV (John Candy for example), which was basically the Canadian SNL. I thought it&#39;s a pretty cool but ironic connection.<br><br>Another connection being Ivan worked with Harold Ramis who was a head writer on SCTV."
