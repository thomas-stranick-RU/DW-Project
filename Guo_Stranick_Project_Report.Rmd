# Executive Summary

This section should summarize the project in a concise, compelling manner, as if presenting to a business stakeholder or client. Include:
Context of the project – Why is this analysis important?

- Trying to predict whether the audience will pay to see movie before release
- can be applicable to any business use case for releasing a product

Data sources – Briefly state where the data comes from and why it was chosen.

- Data comes from youtube and box office mojo, youtube is most popular site to post trailers and get audience feedback

Main objective – What problem does the project address?

- before releasing a product seeing what the audience thinks

Key insights – The most valuable and actionable takeaways from the analysis.
Brief methodology – High-level summary of the data wrangling and analysis process.

# Introduction

Problem Statement – Define the issue being addressed.

- Box office bombs, how can we improve revenue by looking at sentiment from a movie trailer?

Project Relevance – Why is this project important? Who would benefit from the insights?

- Relavant for any business use case, before releasing a product or movie, see what the public thinks

Dataset Overview – Explain the source of the datasets, what they contain, and any initial observations.

- Youtube comments contain sentiments of users about the trailer
- box office mojo contains gross income of movie


Goal of the Analysis – Clearly state the objectives and expected outcomes.

# Data Wrangling & Cleaning

Describe the datasets before and after cleaning, making sure to present the process in a way that a client could understand:
- Initial State of the Data – Size, missing values, inconsistencies, or errors.
- Cleaning Process – Handling of missing values, duplicates, transformations, and formatting.
- Data Merging – How were the datasets combined? What challenges were encountered?
- Final Cleaned Dataset – Summary of the cleaned data (columns retained, new features created, etc.).
- Use before-and-after comparisons (tables or summaries) to make it visually clear.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview of the Data After Cleaning – Key statistics and distributions.
Visualizations – Charts, histograms, and boxplots to identify trends and patterns.
