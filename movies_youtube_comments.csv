Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,Ryan Gosling as Ken is all I need in life.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-28,im obsessed with the dream houses being completely open so theyre easy to play in and the shower despite having no water is being treated like it does. its all perfect.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-31,Bro Ken is just having the time of his life in every scene. The guy lives like he just vibes his whole life
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-31,So nostalgic...it should have been nominated for more awards....I&#39;m 60 and I found myself being a child again....at times crying....I don&#39;t think people gave this movie enough credit....I never even knew Barbie was created by an older woman. I&#39;ve watched it now about 5 times...I still get teary eyed..Margot Robbie was astounding in the role...
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"This has top tier level marketing, music, visuals, fresh ideas, it&#39;s got it all! The world is ready for something NEW. Thank you Greta!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"I love that they&#39;re keeping the plastic aesthetic and exaggerated architecture. Plus, all the actors are perfectly hilarious for their roles. I know this movie is going to be a great time."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-27,I like how the person telling Barbie about the real world is a Barbie that a kid scribbled on a messed up. Such amazing details.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-25,Margot is too good of an actress.  Fully had be believing she was an All American blonde Barbie.  Shockingly good.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-27,The fact that almost every actor has said they had a GREAT time filming this is such a good sign
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"I love that she floats down from the second level of her house to the car. Just like when you‚Äôre playing with Barbies, they defy physics."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"&quot;Humans only have one ending, ideas live forever&quot; is such an incredible line, wow. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach can sure write a great script, and I don&#39;t think this&#39;ll be any different. It looks fantastic. The art direction is incredible."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-06-23,I miss this era so much
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"I would have never imagined, even in one hundred years, that I would be genuinely excited for a Barbie movie to come out. Yet here we are"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"I grew up with Barbie and we all know she&#39;s a huge icon in the toy industry,  but this is ridiculous and fantastic at the same time. I actually want to see this"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-31,"&#39;No, you&#39;re supposed to want to know, do that again.&#39; I love this movie already."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-18,She Played This Role Perfectly üíô Wow This Is The Real World üíô
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"Never thought I&#39;d be so excited for a Barbie movie, but alas here we are. Also Gosling as Ken is just amazing üòÇ"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-01,"&quot;If you love Barbie, you&#39;ll love it. If you hate Barbie, you&#39;ll love it&quot;. I have to admit, I kind of love that."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"Margot is simply stunning. She brings so much heart to the role, she‚Äôs not just a blonde bimbo. She really was born to play Barbie."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-17,This was a great movie and I&#39;m tired of pretending it wasn&#39;t.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I like how Barbie grow up with us: from kids&#39; cartoons to something kind of philosofic and thought-provoking. I&#39;m so glad her world is getting wider.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-28,"Every single person, from the writer, to the director, to the producer, to the actors, supporting cast members and the entire crew, has to be IN-SANE for this to have been made!!! Kudos!!!!! üíûüíûüíû"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-28,"I have the feeling that this movie will have some serious &quot;Truman Show/Black Mirror, but slap a pink filter on it&quot; energy, and honestly, I&#39;m <b>all</b> here for it."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-07,"The movie is not just about women empowerment and gender equality, it‚Äôs also about answering ‚ÄòWhat was I made for?‚Äô. Figuring out your purpose. I never thought that this movie will touch my soul. Such a warm-hearted story. ‚ù§"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"‚ÄúHumans only have one ending, ideas live forever‚Äù. Greta Gerwig is making a masterpiece! This feels like it‚Äôs gonna give kids their first existential crisis and I‚Äôm all for it. If you love Barbie this movie is for you and if you hate Barbie this movie is for you. Wise Words!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I never thought about Gosling playing Ken but that is just brilliant casting and of course Margot as Barbie is perfect
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-30,"The fact that they made this movie the way we played Barbie as kids, making the Barbie‚Äôs life perfect, making ken follow Barbie everywhere, not using the stairs in a Barbie house."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-08-20,"Never thought I‚Äôd say this in a million years, but this movie was fantastic. Hilarious and entertaining til the end."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-27,I love when she kicks her heels off and her feet stay ridiculously arched. That was the moment I knew I have to see this movie. üòÇ
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I love that she just floats to the ground because no one used the stairs as a kid üò≠<br><br>edit: little did I know they&#39;d literally say this in the movie üò≠
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,Hearing the Barbie Girl song at the end I about almost had a heart attack from the excitement of it. Hopefully this means that they are finally listening to us and finally putting the song in there.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-15,Barbie...and Ken... has been medicinal for folks. I come across folks who aren&#39;t quite so glamorous and feel it.<br>Now I say to them we are all Barbies and Kens. I then see them smile.<br>Before I saw the movie I would never have imagined myself saying this.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,"Love how accurately they make her seem like a Barbie doll, from her staying stiff on her toes to floating to the ground since there&#39;s probably not a single kid in the world who used the stairs."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"I like how this is actually a unique idea/new concept for a Barbie movie  Even if it&#39;s a huge established franchise, making a Barbie for adults movie that deals with &quot;real life&quot; is new for the Barbie brand. A breath of fresh air from all the remakes and reboots in Hollywood lately. Can&#39;t wait to see this!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-31,I‚Äôm not even embarrassed to say how excited I am for this. It‚Äôs gonna be an instant classic.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-12-28,"One of the most entertaining films I&#39;ve seen, what a pop comedy, with important themes. As a middle-aged man, I wouldn&#39;t have thought this film would interest me at all, but I ended up liking it a lot."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"‚ÄúHumans only have one ending, ideas live forever‚Äù. Greta Gerwig is making a masterpiece!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,If you love Barbie this movie is for you and if you hate Barbie this movie is for you. Wise Words!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"‚ÄúHumans only have one ending, ideas live forever‚Äù. Greta Gerwig is making a masterpiece! This feels like it‚Äôs gonna give kids their first existential crisis and I‚Äôm all for it. If you love Barbie this movie is for you and if you hate Barbie this movie is for you. Wise Words!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-01-26,A barbie couldn&#39;t be this beautiful. It&#39;s really beautiful. I recommend everyone to watch it.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"Not only did Mattel approve a PG-13 Barbie movie mostly intended for adults who grew up with Barbies, but they also approved a story where they‚Äôre the villains. That‚Äôs just insane"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,This looks so artistic and fun for the actors! Can&#39;t wait. Going to go to the theater dressed as Barbie!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-02,"The fact a Barbie movie is one of the most hype movies this year is astounding<br>Edit: this was an abomination, wow"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-08-23,"This movie was an emotion . It tells so much , how barbie was made to be an aspiration of women , and how its turned out to be a sexualized/ objectified &#39;doll&#39; , Barbie was never made to be a &#39;doll&#39; in the first place ."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I literally screamed at the 2 seconds of hearing I&#39;m a Barbie girl! I knew they&#39;re gonna have to put that song somewhere! I bet it‚Äôs gonna be in the credits
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,"I never thought this day would come, yet here I am legit thinking of seeing a Barbie film in theatres"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBk4NYhWNMM&amp;t=44"">0:44</a> I love that when Barbie says ‚ÄúCold Shower‚Äù, there isn‚Äôt actually any water coming out of the shower head"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-01-31,Pink is not just the color. Pink is life for someone.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,This is a miracle. insert this directly into my brain immediately.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,This feels like it‚Äôs gonna give kids their first existential crisis and I‚Äôm all for it
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-27,I love how she wasn&#39;t really freaking out at the flat foot thing and just started screaming bc everyone else was screaming üòÇ
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-02-12,"Stop Asking Who‚Äôs Still Watching!<br><br>We Never Stop Watching To This MASTERPIECE!!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,"This legitimately looks amazing. The shots look beautful, the sets are stunning, the cast is stacked, and the writing seems decent. Going to watch this in theatres"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,She completely embodies barbie. Exactly how I would imagine barbie as a real human<br><br>Edit: why is everyone hating on Margot she is literally one of the prettiest celebrities
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,I LOVE the fact Make Your Own Kind of Music is in this trailer. Goes with the ‚Äòdoing your own thing‚Äô theme of Barbie
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-06-07,"I love that they used some music from the mid to late 60s, when I played with Barbie. Love you Cass Elliot."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I have a feeling that this movie will be a lot more deep and tear-evoking than just &quot;a Barbie doll goes on silly adventures.&quot; I&#39;m all for it.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-26,"This movie is giving me late 90s, early 2000 vibes. It‚Äôs nice to see Hollywood making more weird, light-hearted, comedy films."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,"I love how they make, at the same time, fun of and a hommage to Barbie."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-07-21,Margot as Barbie is just perfection üíñ
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-30,Imagine if a few years ago someone told you you‚Äôd be hyped for a Barbie movie lol also Kate McKinnon‚Äôs look being a Barbie that met a kid with scissors and pencils is everything.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,This cast is amazing and will Ferrell as an antagonist is always a win!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"I really feel like Ryan is going to kill it in this role, lol.  That scene at the end of the trailer had me rolling!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2025-01-22,Finally watched it.<br>Really enjoyed the ride.<br>Keep an open mind.<br>So much fun.<br>Thanks Greta.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"i&#39;m super excited for this movie! one thing i don&#39;t see a lot of people talking about is how they absolutely NAILED the texture variation in the different types of plastic. it really sells the whole &#39;playset&#39; look of the houses and accessories. cars, slides, and roller skates are smooth and super shiny, while larger areas like the houses are made from a less shiny type."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"&quot;if you love Barbie, this movie is for you&quot;<br>&quot;if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you&quot;<br>Ohhh god can&#39;t wait for this movie to come out and see, love you Margot Robbie ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"I&#39;ve grown up with bratz, barbie, and monster high. But Barbie was the one doll that had a HUGE part in my childhood. Seeing the trailer and all the hype for this movie makes me so excited, I can&#39;t wait to see Margot, Ryan, and America. Such a good casting! &lt;3"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2025-01-25,I&#39;ve had to watch  this DVD several times with young nieces and each time I discover clever nuances I&#39;d missed. Love it!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-01,"I&#39;m clearly not the target audience for this movie, but I&#39;m happy this movie exists. I am so tired of heartless remakes, reboots, reimaginings, sequels, prequels, etc, so it&#39;s refreshing to see people doing original things once again."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"Watch as millions of people get their first introduction to an existential crisis through a Barbie movie. In all seriousness, this could be a masterpiece."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"Can&#39;t wait to see it, also love the fact they added Barbie girl at the end of the trailer just so people would shut up about it. Looks really good and it feels like a modern 2000s movie"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-03-17,Best movie I&#39;ve watch in a long while.. Margot is the perfect Barbie in every way &amp; Greta Gerwig is a genius!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,Me and the boys gonna be strollin into the theatre with full business suits on to witness this masterpiece
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,That ending bit where Ken wants to play doctor and ‚Äújust do one appendectomy‚Äù is genuinely hilarious
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,Can&#39;t wait to go to the cinemas with me and the boys wearing suits and watching this masterpiece
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-10-22,God those times of barbenheimer were insane. Everyone asking which one would be the first to be watched. Miss that era.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"‚ÄúHumans only have one ending, ideas live forever.‚Äù Greta Gerwig is making a masterpiece!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"This looks a lot like &quot;Enchanted&quot; but with Barbie and I love it. That&#39;s one of my favorite premises, two worlds, very different, blending together :D"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"That final line where the ideas lasts forever, is simply masterclass."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-07-14,This era was the definition of ICONIC
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-07-07,Finally a trailer that manages to make you curious about the movie and doesn&#39;t spoil the plot.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-01,The way all barbie and Ken&#39;s lines sound like some absolutely feral play session with an 8 year old is what makes it for me
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-28,I had absolutely no interest in this but the pure detail of the sets and thought put into the world has me very impressed.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-06-30,"Not to be cheesy or anything, but I think the thing we all loved most about ‚ÄúBarbie summer‚Äù other than the fact that it was a great movie, was that all of us women no matter what age, race, religion, or sexuality, were so much nicer to and more supportive of one another leading up to and during the release of this movie. If you saw another woman talking about the movie or at the theater, the conversation was always positive and complimentary of whoever you were talking with. If you saw another woman walk by, you‚Äôd usually give them a ‚Äúhi Barbie!‚Äù Or hear someone else say it. We finally got a movie where all of us women were able to relate to and feel good about, instead of being made fun of. I saw it in theaters with my mom on the opening day and the theater was filled with girls my age (20), women of my mom‚Äôs generation, 6 year olds and 70 something year olds and we all got to feel like a little girl playing with our Barbie‚Äôs again"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"This looks waaaay better than I imagined, even when I had high hopes on Gerwig&#39;s direction!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,The amount of times I‚Äôm gonna watch this movie omg
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-06-03,I love how excited Ken is about getting arrested both times. And his name being and Ken is iconic. And of course the Kate McKinnon Barbie is everything and I love all the Barbie aesthetics. Wonder if they‚Äôre going to get arrested because they steal clothes because they don‚Äôt know that they have to pay for them. Oh I am so exited.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2025-04-19,The flaaaaaaaaaaat feeeeeeeeeeet! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! call me off guard rolling to heaven dead laughing dyinglol
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"When Ryan Gosling appears at the back of the car and starts singing got me laughing out loud. Barbie looks so good, sounds like it has a witty script, a well-rounded plot that isn&#39;t just frills and great acting."
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-28,Ryan Gosling seems to be killing it as Ken. I want to watch it just for his character honestly.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,I found myself smiling through the whole trailer. I think my inner little girl is really excited. <br><br>Definitely gonna see it!
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2025-04-04,The hype for this movie was prime
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"I can&#39;t predict the box office of the movie,but this movie has to win the oscar for costumes and make up<br>The work is outstanding"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"How the freak did they make this actually look seriously good? I mean c&#39;mon, the whole thing is ridiculous and it works fantastically already. Also love how they have the balance between loving and hating Barbie, because I think that&#39;s where I am üòÇ"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-29,I love how campy and clever this film looks. Seriously can‚Äôt wait
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-07-02,Ryan Gosling is outstanding in this.
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-26,"Greta Gerwin has always been special, and her, having such a talented cast at her command, helps her case a lot"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"I love how they incorporated a barbie with marker stains and short chopped hair who is the one who lays out the truth... bc well this Barbie has seen it all and she also lives in a not-only-pink topsy, angular house. I love the attention to detail. Also noticed the plastic pink sand?"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2023-05-25,"I was 90% certain to watch it, now I am 100%. Oh gosh, this movie might be one of the best I will have seen in ages with all the jokes in it and the absolutely incredible plot!"
Barbie,pBk4NYhWNMM,2024-08-23,Wow wow wow<br><br><br>I can‚Äôt say this enough <br>Whoever ever wrote this awesome movie <br>I need to give them a handshake ü§ù <br>And for the director of this implacable movie<br>Weldone<br>Thanks so much for the great cast <br>The movie was great<br>It was giving everything it should give üòäüòäüòäüòä
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"It&#39;s nice seeing how much Miles has grown. In the first movie, he needed his father&#39;s guidance, and in the second, it seems he needs his mother&#39;s. This movie is going to be so worth the wait."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,you can tell how much everyone loves miles! look at how all those other spidermen are trying to hug him!
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-19,I love the transition from finding who you are to seeing if you can uphold your ideals in the real world and what it&#39;s like to deal with the pain and conflict of real life
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-04-03,Miles&#39;s mom&#39;s message is one of the the greatest trailer lines around. Gets me every time
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-18,That slam at the end was personal as hell
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-17,"30 seconds in, I was already getting goosebumps from the music, the dialogue, the flashbacks. This trailer lived well up to expectations, and beyond."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,The one thing I love about these movies is the art design! It‚Äôs honestly amazing. Paired with the story and characters I don‚Äôt see this movie being anything but great.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-03,"Just came back from the theater and holy sh*t  , my expectations were high  but it surpassed them , 10/10 , go watch it !!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-01-29,&quot;We are supposed to be the good guys.&quot;<br>&quot;We are.&quot;<br>I get chills everytime. I come back to this video just to hear that line reading again.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-15,I know everyone is talking about the art style and how much Miles grew and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing but I gotta say the soundtrack is beautiful it really gives you the sense of what Miles is going through and how as a hero he should act ! Can‚Äôt wait for this masterpiece:)
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2025-04-01,Now in 2027 we are waiting Beyond The Spiderverse
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"A trailer that gives a new idea, a general sense of the story and pulling some heart strings, WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE FREAKING STORY.   I thought they forgot how to make exciting trailers like this.  I&#39;m super hyped for the movie."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,I had the biggest smile on my face when I saw Peter B. Parker in the bath robe and the baby holder on his chest! Really makes the ‚ÄúDo I want kids?‚Äù line from the last movie come back in an amazing way.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"That moment when you&#39;re more excited for a trailer than you&#39;ve been all year for anything else<br><br>Edit: to all the people who say that my life must be pretty depressing, I say you are completely and 100% correct"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-11,I‚Äôm still not over how incredibly good this movie is. Everything about this movie is perfection and art. That‚Äôs what you call excellent visually stunning filmmaking. It will 100% be one of the top best movies of the year and even of all time
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,That last scene with him being chased by all the other spidermen was epic. This movie is going to blow our mindsüëç
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,I don&#39;t know what impressed me more: The beautiful animation or the fact that a trailer didn&#39;t spoil half of its movie
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"MASSIVE appreciation for the VA of Mile‚Äôs mother here, I swear it‚Äôs like I can hear her holding back tears<br><br>EDIT: her name is Luna Lauren V√©lez for those who wanna know!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-08-16,"After having seen the movie, it‚Äôs crazy how they were able to portray the motivations of each character within Rio‚Äôs speech and also show a corresponding scene for that character. Like how when she says ‚Äúand you won‚Äôt let anyone tell you that you don‚Äôt belong‚Äù and they show Miguel. They did all that and STILL didn‚Äôt spoil the movie. Major props."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-18,Watching the first spider verse movie in the cinemas when I was 13 is the movie that made me realise that I wanted to be an animator- I‚Äôm 17 now and WELL on my way to becoming one :) this movie was such an inspiration for me and it still is 4 years later
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"At the end of the first film I wondered if Peter B. would end up having kids with MJ as the film implied, and seeing him with a baby carrier just made my little continuity-loving heart sing. I&#39;m so excited for this movie! I&#39;m glad nothing major was spoiled in this trailer"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,Might just be the most emotionally mature and emotionally relatable trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. Just one mother&#39;s love for her son. Everyone with a good mother has had a conversation like this.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-08,"Watching this back after seeing the movie, the way they&#39;ve done the trailer is actual genuis. When she talks about Miles not being accepted, it shows Miguel and the other Spider-Men/Women, as well as other things"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,I really love that 2099 Spidey is in this. He&#39;s easily one of my favorite versions of Spider-Man.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-02-22,"I remember watching this movie and seeing Miles talk to Stan Lee, asking if he could return the costume if it doesn‚Äôt fit, but as Stan himself said ‚Äúit always fits eventually‚Äù. That is what these heroes and especially spider-man are suppose to represent that anyone can be a hero regardless of who you are or we‚Äôre you came from. If you are standing up for what you know is right not just for yourself but for others, that is what makes someone a true hero. Thank you Stan Lee for the decades of stories and the characters that show who we can become and who we desire to be someday."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,The first Spider-Verse movie opened up so many gateways for Marvel and Sony that resulted in NWH being made! Can&#39;t even imagine what this one&#39;s gonna bring!
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-04-12,"&quot;wherever you go you have to take care of that little boy for me. make sure he never forgets where came from and never doubts he is loved&quot;<br><br><br>i always get chills on this one, i can really feel it"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"A sequel to an amazing animated film. Still to this day the music, colors and imagination the first one had is top tier. The influence it has on other series is awesome and I can only hope miles gets more love in this movie."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You‚Äôre not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire movie, but it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe. That‚Äôs a trailer!!!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,The quality of the visuals are 10/10. Love how they seamlessly blend the different animation styles together. Another banger movie as expected from Lord &amp; Miller
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-07-12,One of the greatest animated movies of all time
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"It‚Äôs so cool seeing so many different kinds of spidermen, especially when they actually make them relatable and realistic to what teens would do. What a great time to be alive to be able to see it come to life on the big screen."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-15,Pouring one out for all the animators being sacrificed to bring this into existence.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-14,I almost cried on the train. My mom died when I was little and had to live too a new family far away. And during the trailer I closed my eyes and it was like I could hear her. I hope she‚Äôs proud of me.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-02-25,Damn seeing Peter as a father is emotional. Looks like he&#39;s come so far from the first film and I can&#39;t wait to see him again
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,Spider-Man is a character you can‚Äôt help but root for! He has this amazing emotional connection with his fans that no other superhero has. <br>I still cry happy tears in NWH when MJ is saved by Peter 3 and I watched that film several times!
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"I was not expecting to get emotional when I first saw the title of this trailer, but speaking as a father to a young son, Miles&#39;s mother captured the entire essence and struggle of a parent&#39;s journey in one piece of dialogue. Amazing."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-04,"It‚Äôs funny how going back to watch trailers, you can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúthey showed too much‚Äù"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"I can&#39;t wait to see this movie next year. When I saw the first Spider Verse it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time. The animation, the visuals, the writing, dialogue, and musical score were all phenomenal. If the first one was good then the sequel could be just as good. üíñüíñüíñ"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,This is my most anticipated movie. I can&#39;t wait to see Miles grow even more in this film üíô
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"This movie was the most visually stunning cinema of the last 5 years. Maybe even longer. The fact that is had loveable characters, well written dialogue, and a superhero story that didn&#39;t feel like a rehash of the same tired tropes? That was all just gravy.<br><br>If this sequel manages to bring it visually again, and still work in even a fraction of the same charm, it&#39;ll be a huge success."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-22,"This sequel was a <b>work of art!</b> A worthy recommendation, I must say. Shout out to Lord, Miller and all the animators who put all their hearts and souls into these films.<br><br>EDIT: Oh."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"Looks intense. Love seeing how badass Spidey 2099 is, popping the claws out and everything."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"Many people were surprised by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse when it came out. They didn&#39;t expect it to be as successful as it was, and it gave us a new perspective on the world of superheroes. It also brought back our sense of wonder about the possibilities of animation. It introduced us to the new hero, Miles Morales, and showed us how he is just as compelling as Peter Parker. I am so excited to see more epic things coming to the upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,I love how Miles‚Äô mother is kind of describing what‚Äôs gonna happen or what the story will be.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-25,"Just watched it! Truly one of the greatest sequels to be created! The characters, the motives and everything behind and Miles going his own way. The ending too! Can&#39;t wait till BTSV!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-15,Loved the shot where Miles and Gwen first see all the different Spider people. Then the sudden shock at the end when they are all attacking Miles. Im extremely hyped for the movie.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-16,"I loved into the spider- verse. Not only it&#39;s ny favorite spider- man movie ,and one of my favorite animated features films, but it&#39;s literally one of my favorite movies of all times. It&#39;s a love letter to Spiderman, and pushed the boundaries of what animation as a medium is truly capable of.<br>I cant wait to see what across the spider- verse ,and beyond the spider verse will bring us to the table üï∑üï∏"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-20,"I watched Into the Spiderverse with my dad just before my last year of high-school after a long series of personal struggles. This one comes just before I finish my Bachelor&#39;s degree and just before I move on to my last 3 to get my masters, all the while I&#39;ve had a lot of personal struggles. They keep dropping when I&#39;ve needed em, when I least expected. So excited for this one!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-23,"If Stan Lee was still alive to see this, he would be a proud man."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-01-09,"I swear this is the only trailer I&#39;ve come back to multiple times almost daily. Idk there&#39;s just something so addicting about it. The heart, animation, music, action, message. I love it."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"seriously, more movie trailers today needs to have a story behind it like this one, not just action scenes and dramatic music, but actually paying tribute to the message of the movie"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,Now that&#39;s a good trailer. Getting us emotionally invested instead of just spoiling the coolest scenes and plot of the movie
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-04-04,UGH this made my cry. The way she speaks to Miles is warm. Im a mother now and my only wish is that my child grows up knowing he is loved. Im breaking the mexican misogyny and opening doors to talk about mental illness without having to sugarcoat anything. It‚Äôs something i want my baby to know. Thats feeling emotional doesnt make u we it makes you human and thats okay ‚ù§
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of animation and its techniques / processes, so much that I actually started tearing up a little watching this trailer as silly as it is. It‚Äôs just really nice to see something that obviously has a lot of passion, creativity, and love put towards it to pay tribute to not just animation as a creative medium, but also to Spider-Man ."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,What more could a huge Spider-Man fan want than to see so many Spider-Men in one shot? üï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüî•üî•

And i haven‚Äôt felt alone and out of place like this in so long. That speech reminded me of my folks. Jeez, I‚Äôm a wreck right now. <br><br>Haha, will prob cry again when i watch this in theaters. This trailer is incredible, and its got me tied in emotionally already."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2025-04-21,"I love the transition of the trailer saying &quot;Look, there will be a whole multiverse full of Spider-Man and Miles Morales from the first movie is going to be part of it&quot; to &quot;WTF happens there that he got &#39;99 Spider-Man on his back, not talking about the 1000s of other Spider-Men and the ominous &quot;We are supposed to be the good guys&quot;?!&quot;"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,To everyone who spent all days and years working on this movie I want to thank you for putting everything into this and I hope your families are proud of you. You&#39;re all the real heros

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-16,Teared up through it all. That speech his mother give about not forgeting and remembering and acceptance of who you are is so beautiful. Resonates so much with the period I&#39;m going through my life.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"It was a great choice having his mother narrate the beginning ‚ù§ It shows how her fighting spirit will play a role in his story this time around, and to anyone who‚Äôs played the game you know how important her motivation is!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2025-03-11,I just rewatch this movie and now I need the third one so bad.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-01-14,"As one of the spider-people chasing that kid, the reason we were chasing him is‚Ä¶ I have no clue why I was just following the crowd"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,This is the perfect movie trailer. It doesn&#39;t spoil anything that big and most of all it makes you question the plot which then makes you infinitely hyped up for this film. Can&#39;t wait.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2025-03-05,this is nostalgia nowüò¢ this was released two years ago 2023 the best ERA
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,Good to see B.Parker is on the movie; his dynamic with miles in the first movie was one of the best parts of it
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"Hard to believe that it&#39;s been almost 4 years since Into the Spider-Verse came out, now with the new trailer for Across The Spider-Verse released already, it&#39;s already exciting to see it all come together all at once!

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"First 37 seconds are enough of a trailer to know that this will be a good movie. No flashy stuff to lure me in, just going right at the feels and showing me that this is more... just.. more."

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,Into the spiderverse is definitely one of the best spiderman movies of all time. Hope across the spiderverse can deliver the same amount of hype and fun!
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"Into the Spiderverse inspired the animation industry to experiment more instead of chasing tehnically advanced graphical fidelity like Pixar and Disney, on top of being the best Spidey animated film ever. I&#39;m so excited to see what Across the Spiderverse brings to not just fans of Spider-Man, but also fans of animation ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you to everyone working to make these films great!<br><br>Edit: Changed &quot;realism&quot; to &quot;graphical fidelity&quot; to be more accurate, sorry about the confusion! üòÖ"

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-02,Watched it already. They totally delivered. That cliffhanger ending got me all looking at the cinema screen even tho it was already all black. Can&#39;t wait for 2024.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,The best superhero movies are the ones that remind us that these superheroes we see on T-shirts and backpacks are people that feel like we do.  They&#39;re not just action figures.  <br>They&#39;re characters in a story.  They&#39;re made to make you feel something.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"I&#39;m gotta be honest, that unexpected Stan Lee cameo bought a tear in my eye"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-29,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqGjhVJWtEg&amp;t=114"">1:54</a> The first movie version of this theme sounds cool and perfectly structured, tightly woven with the hip hop element, where miles is in his home dimension; whereas here everything is turned up to 11. They have deliberately made us immediately associate it with the first theme and then walk us step by step, SHOWING how things are different now. It feels like that perfect structure is unravelling all over the place with too many additional layers added and its all overwhelming in so many different ways, which is exactly what is happening in the movie. God I love everything about this movie"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,I think I&#39;ve watched the first one 100 times. It&#39;s by far my favorite movie of all time. From the animation to the story line to the message. I can&#39;t wait for the next. ‚ù§
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-15,"I&#39;m glad this movie seems to be emphasizing the heart and the main character&#39;s personal journeys because as much as I&#39;m hyped for the cameos, I don&#39;t want that to be the only thing going for it. There&#39;s so much more this movie has to offer outside of that<br><br>Im hoping we see more of Miles&#39; relationship with his communnity outside the Spider-Verse like his friendship with Ganke."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-06-09,Just finished watching this and it&#39;s the best movie I&#39;ve seen in a long long time. Didn&#39;t know it was a 2 parter and actually left the cinema raging as I would have gladly sat through another 2 hours of it.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-13,"I like how this style of animation gives ways to Spider-Man&#39;s of varying shapes and builds. I&#39;m used to seeing them all with standard physiques, it&#39;s kind of refreshing to see them with more bulky appearances as well."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"Miles has such a bond with the other spidermen, how he has a sense, how he knows what is the right thing to do.<br><br>Edit: MOM IM FAMOUS"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2022-12-14,"This movie will probably deserve to be one of the top films of 2023 for the art direction alone, but the last movie wasn‚Äôt just beautiful art, it had a great story and plot.  Probably the movie I‚Äôm the most excited for."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,cqGjhVJWtEg,2023-05-31,"I just came back from seeing this movie and i‚Äôm absolutely astonished, this is one of the best superheroes movies (AGAIN) and maybe the best spider-man movie, is incredible they managed not to only make a movie as good as into the spider-verse but better, not only in story, message but also animation. One of the best sequels of history in cinema without a doubt"

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-06-09,I don‚Äôt normally cry at films but this was genuinely one of the saddest films I‚Äôve ever seen.

Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out, as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together. I like to think it&#39;s him saying &quot;hey, I&#39;m still here.&quot; I cannot wait to see this and feel all of the emotions."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-14,"As a man in his 30s, I was crying like a baby, 10/10"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"I‚Äôm already tearing up and the movie isn‚Äôt even out yet, this looks like a true finale for the guardians of the galaxy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,The looks of every character is so cool and the work of CGI is done in a great way .
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,Every guardians of galaxy always give different vibes...sort of goosebumps...
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-09-08,After watching the movie and doing some research on the song &quot;in the meantime&quot; <br><br>I don&#39;t think James could have picked a more perfect track. The song in a nutshell is about self acceptance and learning to live with yourself however flawed you may be.<br><br>Rocket finally accepting himself as a  raccoon and saving others from a terrible fate was absolutely beautiful.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"I can tell this film is gonna have a lot of emotion to it, and the characters really display it so well. Can&#39;t wait for this one"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-03,"Just finished watching the film. I cried, I laughed but most of all I clapped right at the end. A true roller coaster of a movie and it got the ending it deserved. Definitely the best MCU film since Endgame."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,"The music, the dialogs, and the foreshadowing. Man we are going for one hell of an emotional ride."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-10-08,THIS HOW YOU END A PERFECT TRILOGY!! Gosh what an awesome emotional experience.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-06,"I love this franchise, they were able to take this group no one knew about and filled them with the most character to be loved known and loved."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-15,"For me, Guardians are the best movies in the MCU, they&#39;re the only ones I could watch over and over. I love how are the most comedy-filled ones, but still managed to get the most emotional scenes at the end. I&#39;m not ready to say goodbye to the Guardians, specially the saddest being in the Galaxy (yes, Rocket), but I know it will be and amazing, emotionally driven send off"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,When Rocket said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done running.‚Äù It gave me goosebumps.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-08-03,"Have to admit, I shed a tear a few times. Not only for the sheer weight of the scenes and the pay-offs but the bittersweet feeling of knowing this is the last time we&#39;ll see this team up again. This was the last of an era, the swansong of the previous phases. Other than Captain America and Ironman, no one else had such a great send off"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"&quot;We&#39;ll all fly away together. One last time, into the forever, and beautiful sky&quot; <br>This is gonna be so great!!!"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"When Drax threw the ball at that child‚Äôs face, I got goosebumps."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"I‚Äôm so happy to see gamora back and rockets origin story, this is like a mix of gotg 1 and 2 and the ‚Äú I‚Äôm done running‚Äù absolute chills."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-16,this was genuinely one of the best films i‚Äôve ever seen
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-01-23,It amazes me how this feels so much more like an epic conclusion to these characters than anything else in the MCU ever has.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"‚ÄúWe will all ride away together‚Ä¶ one last time, into that beautiful sky‚Äù üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,This movie is gonna be the exact representation of ‚ÄúWorth the wait‚Äù
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-12-04,One year later and it still gives me chills watching the trailer
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-09,‚ÄúPete‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done running.‚Äù Man that line hits so much harder after seeing it.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-08,"it‚Äôs gonna be so hard to say goodbye to the guardians, they‚Äôre easily (and have always been) my favourite group in the MCU and I think ever in any movie/show. I‚Äôll miss them ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"I really hope Rocket does not die, seeing him as a little Raccoon baby was just heart wrenching. Can&#39;t wait for this movie."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2024-12-16,Watching this in 2024 to get a feel for James Gunn&#39;s first Superman teaser trailer lol
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-11,For me the appeal of the Guardians is that it celebrates the &quot;Found&quot; family. Finding people you connect with on a level that transcends blood is an amazing thing. Sometimes those people are a fading twinkle that flickers out too soon. Some stay with you for life. I&#39;ll be sad when this groups story is over but it was amazing while it lasted.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,The family dynamic that this group has will never be replicated when it comes to the MCU. This trilogy is something special üíú.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3V5KDHRQvk&amp;t=79"">1:19</a> I love seeing Nebula with her hands up in the air &amp; looking like she&#39;s having the time of her life. I just want my blue girl to be happy."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-22,"What I love about the trilogy, especially this 3rd film, is how well the music really reels you in in each scene it plays in, and how strong its impact is as the driver for emotions the audience feels"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"Honestly what has me most excited is seeing Nebula be so much closer with the Guardians now, she&#39;s part of their family and it makes me so happy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-25,I‚Äôm not ready to say goodbye to this group.  My favourite group in the MCU.  ‚ù§üò≠
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"Giving Rocket this backstory is extactly the way into our hearts, the only sad part is James Gunn is also gonna make our hearts break doing it.<br>I love this team."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-06-08,"Movie was beautiful, actually restored my faith in marvel. Best one since endgame no doubt."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,I fear not all of the Guardians are going to survive this one :( This will be an emotional one
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all ride away together‚Ä¶ one last time, into that beautiful sky.‚Äù<br><br>Tears already."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3V5KDHRQvk&amp;t=79"">1:19</a> Nebula looks so happy here.  I&#39;m glad she can finally enjoy something full.  Being with the Guardians (and Tony) all that time really helped her open up."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-30,"I&#39;m sad that the guardians franchise is over, but this was a perfect way to end it!"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,I feel like I already know I&#39;m going to cry harder than in the first two movies
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-03,Drax throwing the ball at the kid is all it took to make me burst out laughing üòÇ
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,Hyped for this conclusion! Glad to see them in the classics designs!!
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-07-18,"The movie is a masterpiece, and the trailer complements it so much. It is such a good trailer."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,Now this looks like it‚Äôs going to be great
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-08,"It&#39;s honestly so cathartic seeing Nebula looking so happy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3V5KDHRQvk&amp;t=79"">1:19</a>. Her character&#39;s gone through so much and changed so much through the series. Seeing a moment that at least here seems to be just pure and absolute joy is so moving<br><br>Edit: holy crap, didn&#39;t expect a thousand likes! Thanks y&#39;all!"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-06-09,I watched this when it came out and I still come back to this trailer like I never seen it before lol. I just love when rocket says &quot;We&#39;ll fly away together one last time&quot; üò¢üöÄ
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-04,For those of you that dont realize why not all marvel movies look this good its because James Gunn is a true talented director. He will be missed as hes now heading over to DC to help them create their universe. Its gonna be tough saying goodbye to the guardians.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"‚ÄúPete, I‚Äôm done running.‚Äù<br>I truly felt that. I absolutely cannot wait to see more of Rocket‚Äôs past and Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. üåü"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-04,We need more films like this marvel. Guardians 1 and 2 are phenomenal.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2024-10-10,"The trailer was enough to make me cry. The music, man‚Ä¶"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,"I can‚Äôt explain how much I‚Äôve enjoyed each and every one of these movie. The ‚Äúmotley crew‚Äù that becomes a family has seldom ever been portrayed in movies as well as it has here. Seriously, my favorite movies of the MCU and in general. These movies are truly special to me and I hate to think that some of the team (Rocket) will possibly meet his end here"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,"I don&#39;t know guys, but I feel that this movie is gonna hit really hard in our hearts"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-04,The Guardians have never disappointed. I&#39;m ready to take this last trip with them.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-12-01,This trailer is a year old tommorow. What a wonderful film.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,This movie is going to be a rollercoaster of emotions
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-04,I know marvel has been extremely disappointing for few years but this movie is such a marble with emotional moments that will make you cry. Hope many people go see this movie
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,This movie will definitely deliver some serious emotional moments. Baby Rocket is already melting my heart ‚ù§
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-11-18,Why the rest of the MCU movies can‚Äôt be like this?? This movie is so good
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all fly together‚Äù and then they show Quill screaming for his life really got me in the feels üò≠
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,It‚Äôs hard to believe nearly 9 years ago we were introduced to these amazing characters. ( clarification: introduced into the MCU and many people that didn‚Äôt read comics)
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-07-24,Marvel still got that touch. Endgame wasn&#39;t the end.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-03,"Don&#39;t know what it is exactly, that I so love about Guardians of the Galaxy. Is it some kind of nostalgia? Pop culture references? Music they select? The actors? I really am not totally sure, but I love it!"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-08,"I knew it was going to make me cry but man, I wasn‚Äôt ready to get my heart this broken with Rocket‚Äôs back story. Best Marvel movie after Endgame."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-05-06,"After watching the film, I appreciate what a perfect trailer this actually was. Now I want to see it again."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-07-30,This is by far one of the best movies marvel has made in years
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,This will be rewatched over a million times. Can never get enough of the guardians ‚ù§Ô∏è
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,The guardians have always been the group with the most heart in the MCU to me. I love a group of misfits...I just know it&#39;s going to be a tear-jerker.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-03,please let this be as good as I want it to be
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2025-02-09,Never have been a trailer that got me this excited in my life looking back
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,<b>the music choices in the Guardians movies is always AMAZING</b>
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,I can already feel that this one is gonna be the next Marvel movie that has me crying like a baby
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2023-02-03,"Seeing Nebula happy for once is amazing, she has literally been the female punching bag of the entire MCU/Universe She needs good things to happen to her during and after this movie"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2024-07-16,This movie made me cry a lot more than I‚Äôm willing to admit
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,I really cried with happiness when he said &quot; we&#39;ll all fly together ü•∫&quot;. Guardians of the galaxy back in action ‚úåÔ∏è
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-02,This trilogy means a lot for me. Hope this movie will be the greatest final this trilogy can get.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,u3V5KDHRQvk,2022-12-01,This trailer actually made me start to tear up. Hearing Rocket‚Äôs ‚Äúfly away together‚Äù line as the music swelled. Magic
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Cillian Murphy is a cinematic genius. They could just show his face for 3 hours and he will depict an entire saga of humanity with his expressions.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,The pure emotion of terror in Murphys face is impeccable. What a great actor!!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Man, cillian murphy came a long way in his career, absolutely deserved. He&#39;s an amazing actor and I loved him since 28 Days Later."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2024-03-11,Best Picture<br>Best Director<br>Best Actor<br>Best Supporting Actor<br>Best Original Score <br>Best Cinematography<br>Best Editing<br><br>Congratulations to the Oppenheimer team for your historic Oscar win especially Christopher Nolan who FINALLY got his win üôå
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,"Cillian is one of the greats of this generation. He looks utterly transformed, physically but also the mannerisms are so on-point. Even just the eyes...This is gonna be spectacular."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-01-25,"&quot;They wont fear it, until they understand it. And they wont understand it, until they use it&quot; what a fantastic quote.<br><br>Edit: this BLEW UP. Never had this many likes before. Thanks guys, and just over ONE MONTH LEFT!!<br><br>Opening day edit: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-04-10,I think it‚Äôs very nice of Christopher Nolan to create a movie that will finally give Cillian the Oscar he‚Äôs always deserved‚Ä¶
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-21,<b>July 21st 2023</b><br>Finished watching the movie an hour ago. No words can express the anxiety I felt when the detonation scene played. The sheer silence and then the loud ass kaboomü•≤ WOW!<br>Overall the movie was an emotional rollercoaster. Nobody could&#39;ve made this movie more better than Chris Nolan.<br>I&#39;m leaving this comment here just so my future self can come back and remember it all
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-24,"Not a Marvel, Superhero, Avatar sequel movie and the fact that this already has 30.8 mill views in less than a week. WOW, Christopher Nolan really is the brand itself"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,I love the fact he can make a film about Oppenheimer and he‚Äôs guaranteed a massive audience just because he‚Äôs Christopher Nolan . Legendary director
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Cillian has usually always been more of a side character to some of Nolan‚Äôs movies and now he‚Äôs finally the main character and it‚Äôs very well deserved for a actor like him. He‚Äôs going to kill it without a doubt
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-12,I haven&#39;t been to the cinema for 3 years and this movie was absolutely worth going back. Will probably rewatch it with some friends who haven&#39;t seen it yet aswell. Absolute masterpiece.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt fear it until they understand it‚Ä¶and they won‚Äôt understand it until they‚Äôve used it‚Äù this dialogue is killing me üñ§üñ§
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Murphy alone is a must see. One of the best actors of his generation. He can truly speak without a word.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-31,"If Cillian doesn&#39;t win anything for what he is about to show us, just like he didn&#39;t win anything for Peaky Blinders, I will steal that stuff and bring it to him."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-20,This movie was exquisite. It really makes you feel yourself instead of Oppenheimer and feel his pain. 10/10
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,Artists like Murphy and Nolan are beyond any award. Their Craft is a glory for audience. Loved it.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"It never fails to amaze me how Christopher Nolan, even without attending film school, manages to create such unique, outstanding, pieces of art and become one of the best directors of all time"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,"The fact that at one point in the film Murphy will say &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&quot; already gives me chills"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2024-03-12,"Congratulations, Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer (2023) has 7 Oscar Winners including best picture, best director &amp; best actor this year üëèüëèüëè"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Once i hear Cillian deliver the &quot;I am become Death&quot; speech, i will be complete as a human being. What a brilliant actor"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-04-26,Good to see the Shelby Company leveling up. They went from racing horse to producing nuclear bombs. Props to them.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy captured J. Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s thousands mile stare so perfectly. You can see it in his eyes, the &quot;I&#39;ve done the worst thing anyone can imagine, and I regret it!&quot;-look.<br><br>This could turn out to be a must see for me, the entire premise is so chilling to the core. And especially when we know what those tests resulted in and how much it seemed to haunt Oppenheimer to his death."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2025-02-23,"&quot;They won&#39;t fear it, until they can understand it. And they won&#39;t understand it, until they use it&quot; - awesome quote"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Cillian Murphy has killed it in so many smaller roles in Nolan&#39;s films- it&#39;s about time he headlines one.  Even from the footage in this trailer alone he looks to be giving a great, soulful performance.  His scene in Inception at his father&#39;s deathbed was so simple but powerful."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Couple of things:<br><br>1. Murphy&#39;s eyes are almost like a character in themselves. They express so much, and Nolan made sure to emphasize them to convey magnitude.<br><br>2. I&#39;m curious to see if the close ups of the atomic reaction will also act as a developing character as well, showing more and more of the reaction coming to fruition as the story develops, similar to the blood stain in Insomnia."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Give the cast and crew a big round of an applause for sacrificing themselves from a large nuclear bomb explosion during filming make the movie felt more real and authentic
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-16,"I&#39;ll never forget the time I visited with a WW2 veteran, who was one of the test subject soldiers exposed to an atomic blast.  With &quot;eyes wide shut&quot; and hand in front of his face, he could see the bones in his hands, through his closed lids, through the goggles he wore.  Absolutely awe inspiring, but absolutely frightening.   I would have crapped myself."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,Cillian Murphy is an absolutely impeccable choice for this role - not often I get excited for new movies nowadays but this could be really incredible.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-23,"i hope Mr. Nolan can finally win his most deserving oscar by this film,already a masterpiece."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt fear it until they understand it‚Ä¶and they won‚Äôt understand it until they‚Äôve used it‚Äù  i‚Äôm ready for everything about this movie the dialogue, to the film scores to the cinematography."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-24,"&quot;Is anyone ever going to tell the truth about what&#39;s happening here?&quot; - The way Cillian has said it and if you have seen the movie, the context in which he has said this line really hits you hard. What a masterpiece Oppenheimer is. And how incredible Cillian is‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,Nolan never misses with the music and absolute perfect casting in his movies.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,"The casting of cillian here is genius, he&#39;ll finally play a lead role in a Nolan film tooüî•"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-31,"‚ÄúNow I am become death, destroyer of worlds‚Äù.<br><br>-Oppenheimer"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-10,&quot;We imagine a future... and our imaginings horrify us.&quot; What a movie. INCREDIBLE. üé•üñ§
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-01-14,My god...Cillian&#39;s voice is stunning. It sounds frighteningly like Oppenheimer&#39;s. How does he do that? He bends his voice so well to any role. He&#39;s so underappreciated as an actor and I hope he shines bright in this movie.<br><br>Edit: And the Oscar goes to...
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,The fact that they worked on the tiny detail of the atomic plasma ball disintegrating the tower wire already tells me that this movie is going to be amazing. Christopher Nolan always delivers a very thorough film.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Just the facial expression of his shows the immense emotions and the heart he had put in. I won&#39;t be surprised if he is front runner for Best Actor nomination next time around.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-10-08,"I waited over a year for this movie and it hasn‚Äôt disappointed. I‚Äôve seen it 17 times in IMAX and it doesn‚Äôt get old. This is the best movie of the 21st century so far and Cillian, RDJ, Emily blunt and Nolan all deserve Oscar‚Äôs."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Man, I&#39;d almost forgotten what a talented actor Cilian Murphy actually is! Seeing him in a role other than Tommy Shelby is an amazing change of pace!"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,"This looks fantastic. Cillian seems perfect for this role. An amazing actor with integrity. Really hope this gets him the respect he deserves and leads to greater opportunities.<br>On a side note, I&#39;m very surprised he is not been touted as the next Bond"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,The man who is responsible for what is arguably the most impactful creation in the history of humanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. And who‚Äôs face is filled with nothing but fear and regret for having made it. This looks incredible.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2024-03-11,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Oppenheimer has won 7 academy awards (Including Best Picture):<br><br>Best Editing<br>Best Original Score<br>Best Cinematography<br>Best Supporting Actor<br>Best Leading Actor<br>Best Director<br>Best Picture"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Every time Nolan releases a film, it&#39;s seriously its own cinematic event. I&#39;m sad TENET didn&#39;t score big, but it was still one hell of an experience in IMAX, and this looks even more outstanding."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-04-22,&quot;I thought we were building a rice cooker&quot;<br>Incredible. Such powerful words!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-01-05,Why does Cillian seems to fit perfectly in every role he plays
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-23,Just watched this masterpiece today. Clearly the best work so far from Nolan. Brilliant acting from Cillian and Downey. The cinematography and the direction was on a whole new level.The BGM throughout the movie gives chills and is so perfect. And ofc the Christopher Nolan X factor at the end. Now get the deserving Oscar.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Christopher Nolan always does the big screen justice. He makes some amazing films.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,A huge respect to Nolan&#39;s dedication to shooting without CGI.<br>Looks absolutely brilliant and beautiful&#39;
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"You can never go wrong with Christopher Nolan, he‚Äôs one of the great directors out there"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-20,Christopher Nolan Infinity Stones :<br>Space - Interstellar<br>Mind - Memento<br>Reality - Inception<br>Power - Batman<br>Time - Tenet<br>Soul - Prestige <br><br>Oppenheimer is the Gauntlet
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,I haven‚Äôt seen another actor that conveys so much emotion through his face‚Ä¶. You can tell complex emotions just through his eyes alone. Amazing
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I was surprised at how Cillian&#39;s voice sounds remarkably like Oppenheimer, then actually seeing him and he looks like Oppenheimer as well!  I am very excited to see this movie.  Great actors and an amazing director coming together to tell such a compelling story.  The human piece behind making the most destructive force our planet has ever seen..."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Hopefully this can get Cillian a much deserved Oscar nom!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-19,"The best cinematic experience I‚Äôve ever had! I didn‚Äôt saw it in IMAX but wow my heart was beating fast and very loud üòÖ Nolan, Cillian Murphy and RDJ really deserve an Oscar"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-02-19,"He can out act 99% of Hollywood just with his face. After seeing that 1 scene in Inception (safe scene with his dad), thats when I knew this dude is truly a phenomenal actor."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"This movie is going to be another cinematic masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Also, I‚Äôm glad that Cillian Murphy is having the chance to prove his unique performance to portray the man who built the most powerful and destructive weapon ever created."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,I need Nolan to win an Oscar. He deserves it
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-20,If Murphy doesnt get an Oscar for this then the Oscars will simply never be respected ever again. This is cinematic genius. This is the benchmark for brilliance
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,i love that the score alternates between hopeful and ominous notes. this is likely one of the themes in this movie
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-02-02,"What I really love the most about this trailer is the music. It‚Äôs atmospheric, strangely uplifting as well as sinister, very emotive. The swelling horns or strings or whatever they are extremely warm and uplifting, which contrasts so strangely but beautifully against the horror of the potential of nuclear weaponry. The imagery is cosmic, big-bang-esque, yet all the dialogue points to the anxiety and dread of such an invention. I love this contrast very much, it creates a strange space we‚Äôre we can sort of feel how absurd, miraculous, and horrifying it is for human beings to have reached the threshold of such power. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we can be trusted‚Ä¶‚Äù well that‚Äôs really the thesis of the whole thing aint it"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I swear, the cinematography in Christopher Nolan‚Äôs movies makes them look like pure art"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2025-01-14,I&#39;m an Irish man from Dublin we so proud of him  and to be Irish greatest performance he s ever done what an actor
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,Murphy really brings home the terror that Oppenheimer felt about their creation. This trailer looks stunning. So excited to watch this next year in theatre!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,It‚Äôs not often when movie trailers can give you chills.  The music with the beautiful scenery &amp; horrific destruction is top tier film making.  This is definitely my most anticipated film now.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I applaud Christopher Nolan&#39;s commitment to getting his shots in-camera, using film, with practical effects done on the set whenever possible. So for this one I have concerns..."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-10,I am grateful to have witnessed this in the Cinema in IMAX. Mindblowing art.<br><br>Interstellar and this were MUSTS to see in theaters. Both left me speechless.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-20,"What a great person to play Oppenheimer. Murphy has such a talent for emoting internal conflict and introspection on the faces of his characters. Oppenheimer‚Äôs direct contribution to the development of nuclear technology is as much a revolutionary innovation in science as it is a threat to peace, and Oppenheimer was keenly aware of that fact. Oppenheimer is a figure that perhaps best exemplifies the tension between human progress and the moral implications of such weaponry. Oppenheimer didn‚Äôt regret being integral to the development of such technology, but any sane man would look at his creation and feel the mitest sort of dread of the possible uses of such a thing, and how that would change the course of history."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-04-21,&quot;I thought we were building a rice cooker&quot;
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2024-08-06,Oppenheimer was born so that Cillian Murphy could win Oscar
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-23,Beautiful trailer. It&#39;s great to finally see him leading the cast of a Nolan picture. I&#39;ve been waiting for this one.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I am floored by how crisp and beautiful this footage looks.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=24"">0:24</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=27"">0:27</a> are splendid.  Oddly enough, with Nolan going back to black and white (being the first production to shoot black and white IMAX footage, at that), this seems to be his most colourful and vibrant film yet.  Pause the video and scroll to random times throughout the trailer.  Each frame highlights the variety of colours ‚Äì many feel like they could be a promotional still.  In short: I am excited."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I love how in each still shown in this trailer, Cillian Murphy has the expression of the man who is terrified of his creation but still goes on pursuing it without any control over his mind or heart! Absolutely genius actor and an equally brilliant director. Can&#39;t wait to watch this masterpiece ‚ù§"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-09-05,"I watched it at movie theatre, this movie deserve each penny. Cinematic and camera effects are superb"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,This is just masterpiece. Emotions on Cilian&#39;s face are just amazing. What a versatile actor. And Nolan.. no words for him
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-03-21,I don&#39;t expect less than an Academy Award¬Æ nomination for Cillian Murphy as Best Actor and a nomination for Robert Downey Jr. as Best Supporting Actor. This movie is gonna be insane! Christopher Nolan never disappoints.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-05-05,Just give Cillian an oscar already. He&#39;s incredible. Aaand finally he&#39;s done it!!!üôå
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-08-01,"The last line of the play, which I remember from years ago as it was so impactful - ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve left a loaded gun in a playground‚Äù ü§Ø And then comes the final line ‚ÄúI am become death, the destroyer of worlds‚Äù black out, end of play. Wow, I remember that experience so well, it was an incredible play!  <br><br>It will be interesting to see it translated to the big screen"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"J Robert Oppenheimer is one of the most important figures in the era of World War II. He has been long overdue for a biopic movie, I&#39;m so glad that the movie got the right writer and director to make a movie based on his life and his career"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-06-14,"This trailer gives me goosebumps. Murphy&#39;s face, the soundtrack, the quotes such as &quot;they won&#39;t understand it until they&#39;ve used it&quot; are just trilling and sublime. Will look forward to this."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Definitely gonna be something I&#39;ll be looking forward to for the next year. <br>The combination of Cillian Murphy&#39;s acting with Nolan&#39;s direction. <br>A &quot;boom&quot; duo!!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-21,"I just watched this in theaters, let me say this movie is truly outstanding"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-05-02,&quot;Theory will only take you so far.&quot; Another great quote. I couldn&#39;t help but have shivers run down my spine.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"The absolute range of Murphy&#39;s acting is that he can go from a terrifying warlord gangster to a man questioning his entire existence, this is gonna be a legendary film."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,I‚Äôm excited for Cillian to get the recognition he deserves! He is such an amazing and underrated actor!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-18,The way the soundtrack just switches the mood. One of the best bgm I&#39;ve heard in a long time.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-21,Was super fortunate to briefly meet Cillian on the set of A Quiet Place 2 while being a extra. I was alittle nervous to approach but would regret if I didn&#39;t try. He was incredibly nice and told me about how he enjoyed working in my local area ( the Buffalo wings specifically! )... I always enjoyed him in films but the interaction and how down to Earth he was gave me a new respect. I can&#39;t wait to see him star in this film!
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> that stare itself deserves to get an oscar of its own, that stare shows the realisation that he got by seeing his own invention as how destructive it is for humans and the terror he got by thinking that and Cillian depicted that perfectly.. <br>Hats off to such gem of an actor.."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre FINALLY telling this man‚Äôs story. We‚Äôve all heard his name in other films or WW2 lessons, but I really doubt anyone understands what he was. This should be amazing."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2023-07-29,"I watched the movie in the cinema 7 days ago, can‚Äôt get over it‚Ä¶ it is so good that every time I either hear the soundtrack or see a scene I get goosebumps. Go check it out!"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"This feel as epic as Interstellar.   Nolan is bet when he does not make a movie, but instead engages and invites his audience to participate in the cinema.    I had zero expectations for this film... until I watched this trailer.     I am confident, and excited to experience, Nolan demonstrating the impact this historical event delivered unto our society."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"This movie looks epic! Cillian Murphy getting the role of a lifetime, and seems like he is nailing it. This is going to be Oscar worthy if Nolan nails it. July 2023 can&#39;t get here fast enough!"
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,I‚Äôm very happy see Murphy finally get a huge starring role in a film. The man deserves it after all these years. He‚Äôs a phenomenal talent. I‚Äôve been a fan ever since I saw him in Red Eye. <br>This film looks like it will be great! üëçüèª
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2024-03-11,Who&#39;s here after Cilian Murphy won The Oscar
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-25,Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is the most perfect casting as we can see after the invention Oppenheimer became very lifeless. Cillian can portray that expression EXTREMELY WELL.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Cillian Murphy is going to nail his performance. A fantabulous spectacle this is going to be. The optical aspects of this film are gonna be skyrocketing. The incredible direction. Then the biopic. Christopher Nolan is at ready for an Oscar.
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,You can never go wrong with Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,"Was hoping for the &quot;I am death&quot; part, but Nolan would never never be so obvious. So  looking forward to this."
Oppenheimer,bK6ldnjE3Y0,2022-12-19,Cillian Murphy finally getting leading role that he deserves.

The Little Mermaid,kpGo2_d3oYE,2024-11-04,"My two cents: movie is too long, first third is too long, it really only picks up after Ariel transforma into a human. But even from then, pacing is so slow, screenplay writing is pretty bad. When Eric sees Ariel for the second time thinking she could be &quot;the one&quot;, but then realizing she cant speak and couldn&#39;t possibly be her, there is no dialogue at all in the scene. This scene is kind of a climax because we all want Eric to figure out that it IS her. They really shouldve had Eric say something like &quot;You dont speak?&quot; Then look dismayed and turn to Grimsby and say &quot;I thought it might be her, but its not her. Lets keep searching.&quot;.  These remakes are so bad. Like Disney knows everyone is gonna watch them regardtand they really dont do anything special with them. Excluding Burton&#39;s Alice in Wonderland. Those were really original."

Never watched a movie in theaters twice before, but this will be the exception<br>UPDATE: still cried the second time :‚Äô) I watched it on IMAX this time, personally, I preferred Dobly- the seats are more comfortable, the colors were richer, the sounds were louder, overall felt more engaged"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"I remember seeing Avatar at the opening midnight showing in IMAX 3D. The entire theater had been decorated with trees and vines and plants to look like Pandora. The IMAX had been calibrated specifically for the film. Sold out theater. Then some reps from the IMAX and film industry asked us to stay after to discuss the film, and then asked everyone if they were ready to see the most expensive motion picture ever made, the audience went crazy. It was like being at a sports event. Then they did a countdown from 10. Such an unforgettable movie going experience."

Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"I remember the first time I saw this movie, It was an accident. I was a kid and I asked my grandpa if we could watch Avatar the Last Air Bender. He went to a local Blockbuster CD store that was there at the time, and bought James Cameron&#39;s Avatar. I was so confused but at the same time, I was having the time of my life watching the whole thing. Avatar has been my favorite movie for years and I&#39;ve been waiting for the sequels ever since. I&#39;m so happy its almost here! Also, I love hearing Sigourney Weaver&#39;s voice again!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"I work for one of the studios that put a lot of heavy work on this film. Lots of crazy overtime, on average some will work 56-70hours. Very tight weekly deadlines, the stress levels were high, and the technical challenges for the motion editors, animators and VFX people in general were many. But seeing it all come together into this incredible master piece makes it all worth it. We hope everyone enjoys it. I cannot wait to see this movie!<br><br>EDIT: Besides the intense amount of work, there was also ALOT of fun stuff in the production of this film. Working in the film/Vfx can be fun and gives you new challenges and different ways to upskill and keep getting better. <br><br>And for those who are asking about the story....Let me just say, the movie is 3hours long, it&#39;s going to move you, it&#39;s going to touch you and it&#39;s going to blow your mind ;)"

Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-12,"1 thing that I loved about Avatar 1 was the implication of intricate ecosystems of virtual creatures. I&#39;m seeing so many more creatures just from these shots. They didn&#39;t have to add that many variety of underwater plants and sunfish-like creatures, but they did. It&#39;s obvious that they recognize that strength from the first movie. I am already satisfied. Just put a bunch of shot of the Navi people playing around with whales and other animals, and I&#39;ll be immensely satisfied."

Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2025-01-28,"2 years ago and I still get goosebumps from these audios <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9MyW72ELq0&amp;t=95"">1:35</a><br>2 years and I still think this is one of the best movie trailers I ever seen"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-12-10,"I remember being 8 years old when Avatar came out. I was obsessed and never thought a sequel would be made; but here we are, 13 years later! I can‚Äôt contain my excitement! Just finished watching the first Avatar in preparation for release this upcoming week. Favorite movie of all time, going to be epic!! James Cameron is a genius."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-03,"I was 10 when the original movie came out, and I wasn‚Äôt even old enough to go see it by myself so my aunt came and saw it with me. I was, and still am, absolutely in love with this movie and the thing I love the most about it is that the storyline was one that grew with you as you got older and so as I got older this movie became more special to me. Now I‚Äôm 23, and to say that I am excited for this movie is an understatement. 13 years of waiting patiently for James Cameron to finish this soon to be masterpiece and I cannot wait to see it!! Just from the trailers, photos, and clips released over the last couple months I can already tell that this movie will be worth the wait. I even got emotional watching this trailer because not only are we seeing the absolutely gorgeous visuals but it‚Äôs actually starting to feel real that we are FINALLY getting the sequel. 13 years of waiting and now it‚Äôs just a little over a month away. It‚Äôs surreal and exciting and I‚Äôm counting the days!!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-12-15,"13 years ago I was 8 years old. I was obsessed with Avatar and seeing the continuation of the beautiful story yesterday was AMAZING. James Cameron did his best to bring us back an even more beautiful Pandora. I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t shed a tear yesterday, but I did, the movie is a MASTERPIECE!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2024-03-18,"I was 11 when Avatar came out first, I am now 23 years old. And my connection towards the film didn&#39;t change even an inch. Someone really hurt Cameron&#39;s pride when they said &quot;you couldn&#39;t have outdone Titanic&#39;&quot; He went out and did this. This movie brought me to tears more than I did back in my teenage and I am not even ashamed because it brings out our emotions just like they planned. This is a masterpiece!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-07,"This is one of my favorite trailers ever I think. For some reason I cannot stop watching it. The ‚ÄúI see you‚Äù and ‚Äúway of water connects all things‚Äù lines are too great. Combined with the music and visuals, amazing"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,If you never saw the first movie in theaters you have no idea how visually stunning this is truly going to be.  A movie that must be seen in theaters to truly be appreciated.
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-03,I want to thank the CGI team for making this a stunning masterpiece. I can tell this took a painful amount of time to make this look so breathtakingly amazing. You guys must be proud of your work. Thank you so much!! üíôüíôüíô
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2024-11-10,Please Re Release This Movie on Theatre Again  . i missed the movie to watch due to work pressure . i want to experience this movie in 3D . Please if possible please Re Release this Hidden Gem üëçüèª.
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-04,"James Cameron really knows how to create a world and make you feel like it‚Äôs a place you can visit. I‚Äôve watch avatar, so many times since I came out. I‚Äôm so happy this movie is coming out"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-12-26,"I didn‚Äôt rewatch the first Avatar before seeing this film so I‚Äôve practically forgotten what it was about. But this film still managed to make me invest in the characters and the story. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the film and it had me sobbing at the ending. That‚Äôs how amazing this masterpiece is. Definitely one of the best theater experiences I‚Äôve ever had, second to Moana."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,The fact that they developed technology to film mocap underwater is in and of itself absolutely incredible
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-04-28,It was really worth the wait... perfect acting and perfect cast
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"I was a kid, first time watching a movie with my mom in the movies. Went only twice with her and I will definitely watch this with her again."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"If you saw the re-release of Avatar and got a sneak peek of a scene from this one, you&#39;ll already know the stunning differences in quality and effects between the two films. Cameron has done it again tbh. This is going to set a new standard and precedent for filming. And if you didn&#39;t get a chance to see it, you are NOT ready for how this is going to blow you away.<br>Can&#39;t wait to cry about our pretty blue aliens all over again!!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-09,"I was 8 years old when I saw this in IMAX. Avatar is the movie that inspired me to move to LA to pursue a career in the film industry. I‚Äôm 21 now and I‚Äôm still working on that goal. I‚Äòve been waiting since 2014 to see this and now it‚Äôs finally here! I plan on seeing this opening night and I‚Äôm probably gonna ball my eyes out, but regardless I‚Äôm super excited to watch this!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-06-26,They should&#39;ve renamed this to &quot;Avatar: Constantly saving our kids&quot; ...<br>Because that&#39;s what the entire goddamn movie was about.... saving their kids that couldn&#39;t listen to their parents...
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-01-29,"you know the movie is incredible when you come back to watch the trailer, after watching it 3 times at the cinema"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"James Cameron is continuing the legacy of Avatar. I distinctly remember watching the first movie in the franchise when I was eight or nine, and I‚Äôm 21 now, so obviously its been ages since then. It‚Äôs cool to see that the graphics and effects have improved so much over the last 13 years or so. Its becoming more and more realistic. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and many more already have the capacity to make this film a life changing event for all of us here. The Way of the Water here we come."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,It&#39;s sad that James Horner is not here anymore to compose the sequels after a tragic plane crash that killed him. His music in Avatar was amazing and look forward to hear some of his music being reused in this movie
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-06-19,"This movie made me speechless.<br>I loved the underwater scenes so much!!!! It was truly amazing. The water effects.<br>It literally made me want to live underwater and even become diver :D<br>Really loved the movie, it has been very long time since the first avatar movie."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-12-16,"This movie was absolutely AMAZING, it didnt feel like 3 hours at all and I was engaged in the movie the entire time! It&#39;s an absolute masterpiece!!!"
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-01-03,"People who haven&#39;t watched yet, believe me. The visuals are so spectacular, too good to be enjoyed on a phone screen or a computer monitor. You have to experience it on a big screen."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-12-26,"Honestly I absolutely love this film, my money, and 3 hours was worth it to watch this. Tbh this movie really deserves more hype."
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2023-09-02,You know what many Avatar fans watch trailer to test their new device screen
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,Avatar will always have the most impressive and stunning CGI in anything. It‚Äôs so incredibly good and the team that worked on it deserve millions
Avatar: The Way of Water,d9MyW72ELq0,2022-11-02,"I have been in love with Avatar&#39;s worldbuilding from the moment I laid eyes on the first scenes in the first movie. I&#39;m so excited to return to it. And I know it&#39;s been so many years since we&#39;ve last been there, but the long wait is going to make the reunion that much more touching. I can guarantee I will be crying once the movie starts."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Oh god, can&#39;t wait to see this. I love Spider-man."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Scott deserves a big spot in our heart for his Spiderman spirit
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-11-07,I‚Äôm sorry but whoever made the trailer song is a genius. Combining yellow brick road by Elton John with the Loki theme was brilliant composing. Hats off to them
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-06-19,Whoever came up with the song and the trailer deserve a big raise.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Portraying both antman and spider man at same time need huge talent, respect increase so much for this guy"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The buildup to more comic book accurate suits is phenomenal.<br>Can&#39;t wait.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-27,What I already like about this movie is that it&#39;s Scott who&#39;s gonna be the first person to face the main villain of the multiverse
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-03-21,"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The guy who said &quot;Thank you Spider-Man&quot; would&#39;ve probably been Stan Lee if he were still here. üôèüèæ
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Paul Rudd is doing an amazing job portraying Spider Man though, it takes talent."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Kang‚Äôs design is on point, and I think Jonathan Majors is gonna rock this role."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-09-08,When the soundtrack for the TRAILER is better than the entire movie you know you‚Äôre in trouble‚Ä¶
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I love how Scott says that the people who adores him often calls him as Spider-Man by mistake while the ‚ÄúNext Big Bad‚Äù that is Kang knows that he‚Äôs the one and only Ant-Man
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,This has the potential to be the best of the Ant-Man movies.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The micro verse looks absolutely gorgeous props to the VFX team
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-03-23,I come back to this video every time because of their version of yellow brick road. For some reason movie trailers make songs sound 10x better
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Notice how the evil music plays out as we see Kang for the first time (without his face in that frame) ! Literal goosebumps!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I&#39;m so happy for Jonathan Majors getting the chance to play Kang and show off what a good actor he is.<br><br><br><br><br>Edit: Thanks for the likes guys! I&#39;m not going to bother reading the replies because there most likely are contrarians in there. Just know that JM deserves all the success in the world.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"The fact that in Loki he was so cheerful and joyful, but how in this he‚Äôs both calm and menacing by just a single sentence."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-02-24,"I love it when Scott says, ‚ÄúCassie!‚Äù Then it rises to a soft synth of the Elton John chords. Truly good trailer. Don‚Äôt know bout the movie itself though."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"I love how Kang sounds so calm, yet at the same time so terrifying...üòÆ"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I&#39;m obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang. The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles. Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is such a great actor, I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-05-12,how can a trailer be better than a whole movie?üíÄ
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,It is truly amazing how he went all the way from civil war to this. He has come a long way.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists ? The visuals are stunning !
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors has been killing it with Lovecraft Country, Loki, Creed 3 and now Antman 3 and Avengers 5. Happy he‚Äôs getting recognition."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-03-03,The music for this trailer was SO terrifyingly epic
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are. Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are. HWR is more joyous and playful, especially when he still held the cards. Kang is more proud in his speaking, it has a sort of power, like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to, and his speaking is so cold too. Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is a fantastic actor. He&#39;s very talented and has incredible screen presence. There&#39;s a special aura to him every time he appears in something. He looks great as Kang The Conqueror, a villain who I&#39;ve been waiting to see adapted for a long time. I&#39;m very happy for the success he&#39;s having."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Really excited to see Jonathan Majors play Kang. He did extremely well as he who remains, and I can already tell he&#39;s gonna deliver with this one too!"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-03-01,Whether you‚Äôd think Quantumania is a quantum joke or not.<br><br>The trailers never fail.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-12-15,this is by far the best movie trailer song ive ever heard. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was somehow composed so so amazingly to the trailer I just can&#39;t stop watching it
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,My favourite part was when Hank Pym told Scott &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I can&#39;t express how much I&#39;m excited for this new spider-man movie
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-10-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlNFpri-Y40&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> Chills every time"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,This movie looks like it&#39;ll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise. I&#39;m so excited to see Jonathan Majors again. He&#39;s so charismatic and I love that  we&#39;ll be seeing different versions of Kang<br><br>Edit: I understand big picture is always in the MCU as a whole but I just meant for kang dynasty and secret wars
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I love Kang&#39;s composure. Looks so calm as if his intentions are pure but he desires to cause mass destruction ü§£
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-09-20,So my problem with this movie is that changed the story from what see in the trailer to what you saw in theaters. Kang offered Scott more time because he was gone for 5 years but in the movie he threatens to just kill his daughter.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Okay but the orchestrated version of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road just makes this so phenomenal
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I can already tell that Majors is gonna absolutely kill it as Kang.  This is gonna be amazing!!!!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Kang&#39;s lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here. I&#39;m so excited!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-11-12,The trailer is better than the whole movie honestly.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-12-01,I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal. Mavel&#39;s ability to make killer trails is amazing. Can&#39;t wait for this to come out!!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Kang is going to play such a huge part, I&#39;m hoping his actor makes slight change to every Kang variant to make em unique"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-02-03,Someone should really give the trailer guy a raise they somehow get you to be excited for any movie
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"JM as Kang is intimidating af, same as Thanos this is 100% perfect casting"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-28,"Feel like this is gonna be more serious than the previous 2 movies. Which is a nice change of pace, where the ambiance matches the situation. As opposed to the last thor movie where the stakes were drastic, but everyone was somehow trying to be funny. Scott cares about his family more than anything, and now they are all in danger, and Kang seems to be offering a solution."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits, i&#39;m so excited for this movie!!"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-02-26,Can‚Äôt believe this is already 2 years old
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,It‚Äôs wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that this version of Kang has an entirely different aura about him than the He Who Remains version in Loki. Really looking forward to Jonathan‚Äôs performances with the character!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The last time Hank told Scott that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility &quot;I almost cried at the cinema <br>üò≠Can&#39;t wait to see the new SpiderMan movie.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,I can&#39;t wait to watch this. Ant-Man is such a well developed character that I don&#39;t think gets enough love.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-02-11,When the trailer way better than actual movie ü§£
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"The music selection is, once again, on point. Kudos to Marvel for always hitting the nail on the head with these."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I can‚Äôt imagine any other actor playing the role none other than Paul Rudd himself.<br><br><br>What a great Spider-Man
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,The actor really nailed the Kang vibe. He is practically dripping in it.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-10-27,"It‚Äôs so odd that they changed the script from trailer to movie. <br>In the trailer, Kang offered to give Scott more time with his daughter and had a more humble tone with calling him ‚ÄúAnt-Man‚Äù. <br><br>In the movie, he just threatens to kill Cassie and calls him Ant-Man mockingly."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Yes! I personally love the Ant Man movies. I think they&#39;re very underappreciated. And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was!!!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The fact that we&#39;re getting TWO spiderman movies in such a short amount of time is crazy. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Thank you Spider-man ‚ù§
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-10-01,If only the movie had been this good.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Scott being at the forefront of Kang debut is epic.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re lucky enough to get another spiderman movie so soon üòç
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"It&#39;s weird to see how far we&#39;ve come from the first ant man movie, it&#39;s one of my favorite mcu movies ever, it&#39;s self contained, had an awesome soundtrack and worked perfectly in such a huge universe and now suddenly by the 3rd movie he&#39;s working with Kang."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-02-27,Props to Disney for absolutely butchering what could have been a glorious introduction to Kang prime and scrapping the entire Kang storyline. Absolute L
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Kang is such a good name to just scream at the heavens like he‚Äôs getting away every time, just something about it. Shaking my fist into the air."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"This looks awesome. Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we‚Äôve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe, it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,This is going to be THE film that finally brings everything together for phase 4 and paved the way for what we are really starting to head towards and I cannot wait
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-10-20,This trailer is better than the movie itself
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-26,Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John&#39;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; into the &quot;Loki&quot; theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road. Beautifully done. üíñ üëè
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"this actually looks crazy compared to the other ant-man movies, phase 5 couldn‚Äôt come soon enough"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Can&#39;t wait for Spider-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania!! Looks really good! Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too, he&#39;s heavily underrated."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-08-29,When the trailer‚Äôs remix song is the highlight of the whole movie‚Ä¶
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-29,‚ÄúWith small size comes great responsibility‚Äù <br>I will never forget these wise words.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I&#39;ve always felt like the Ant-Man movies are super underrated. I&#39;m very excited for this next one!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-02-19,"I&#39;ve seen this movie and I just want to confirm it is a movie. Infact it will go down in history as a movie. As far as Marvel movies goes it was one of them. The actors acted, the writers wrote and the director directed. I watched it. I&#39;ve reviewed it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"I think, Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU. I love it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"When spider man says: &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility&quot; i felt that, truly a great moment"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Antman was one of the Marvel movies I wasn&#39;t really excited about on the first one, but then it had a different feel and was just so much fun I think I look the most forward to his stand alone movies. They feel like a nice break from the usual Marvel feel, but end up adding so much to the overall story arch."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-06-29,I wish the movie was as badass as this
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,I wasn&#39;t expecting this to look so good. It felt like it was going to be a throw away film to get Kang in proper but it seems like a solid film.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-11-27,"I saw this trailer in theaters a few weeks ago, and I am still in awe at how they were able to make Goodbye Yellow Brick Road work soooo well with this trailer. It sounds so much like music from Loki and I love every second of jt. The composers on this movie deserve some extreme praise! Incredible job!"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Excited to see how this ties into the next Avengers movie. Need to learn more about Kang, but he looks epic in this trailer."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2023-02-26,I love how he goes all in on the owners and chefs but always stays respectful towards the waiters
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is killin&#39; it as Kang! Honestly, I cannot wait to see more of him in these movies. What a phenominal presence he brings!<br>Just seeing that he&#39;s 2 years older than me and, man, do I feel unaccomplished!"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"That first scene was incredibly epic!<br>Seeing Kang gave me chills.<br>They might be skimping on CGI on Disney+ to save money, but I&#39;m relieved to see they aren&#39;t pulling punches with the CGI here. Looks incredible.<br>Really looking forward to this."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,From worlds best grandma to spider-man<br><br>This man&#39;s evolution is unparalleled
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-10-13,Imagine being the next major villain. Easily 4-5 movies making at least 2 billion at the box office. And just to throw it all away...
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"The visuals are gonna be insaneüî•üî•, and Kang looks intimidating af."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,The entire trailer is summed up in a single sentence: &quot;Thank you Spider-Man&quot;üòá
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"Finally, something that drives the plot forward."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2025-03-10,Came back just for the music
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"i hope this movie won‚Äôt lose the heart that the other two had, it looks promising!"
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-25,"Even from a few seconds in this trailer, you can see Jonathan Majors‚Äô incredible range. His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic, aloof kinda vibe he‚Äôs giving off here. I‚Äôve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I‚Äôm already blown away by him."
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,Love how comic accurate they made kangs suit. It works so well on the big screen. Jonathan Majors is gonna kill it!
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2024-05-02,This movie had potential üò≠
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-26,The trailer and the song go together perfectly
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,ZlNFpri-Y40,2022-10-24,"This looks amazing. Not gonna lie, I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga. It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale. Always been a fan of Peyton Reed‚Äôs Ant Man films and I feel like he‚Äôs gonna knock it out of the park with this one.<br>Edit : this didn‚Äôt age well"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"No one ever thought, when the original came out, that this character would jump into popular culture. That this world would intrigue people and make them interested in knowing more about it. It was so well written, so well directed. But most importantly, Keanu made this movie franchise what it is today<br>Edit: For people saying the movies are not well written, just bang bang gun fu, allow me to remind you that John Wicks character is built up long before he ever touches a gun. The intricacies in the stories are in the details of the world. The rules of the hotel. Whatt motivates these individuals to break/ follow those rules? The writing Is much deeper than just mindless shooting."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"Part of what makes the John Wick series so memorable is the portrayal of the unique culture of the underworld with its hierarchy, rules, scope, etc. It completely sidesteps all the typical mafia tropes we&#39;ve come to expect from Hollywood, I look forward to seeing more of that in this latest film. Oh and also watching Keanu generously distributing copious amounts of lead and death to random bad guys."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-08-13,I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I‚Äôve rewatched this trailer before and after I saw the film. It‚Äôs simply perfect. The music is incredible.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"john wick is one of the only franchises i can never get tired of, they always find a way to keep it fresh"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"The fact that Donnie Yen, Keanu Reeves, and Hiroyuki Sanada can still move like this at their age is going to get me into martial arts training.<br><br>Edit: the people replying ‚Äústunt doubles‚Äù to this assume that the rest of us are not smart enough to be aware of the existence of stuntmen. Here‚Äôs a shocker: we know. <br><br>The fact is that those guys can move in a manner that is atypical for their ages, and what they all have in common is martial arts training. Stop being internet smartasses."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,Let&#39;s be honest Keanu Reeves has been a beacon right now. This man is such a humble human. He deserves EVERY role he gets and has. Can&#39;t wait to see it in theaters!<br>..My girl broke up with me send me love and a dollar she screwed me over $rythefryguy<br><br><br>Edit: Thanks for the likes guys I&#39;m glad we can all agree this man is a legend. These past few years have been tough and his interviews and movies are just a great thing to zone out to. And cyberpunk has been on a rise.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-13,Donnie Yen is 59 and Keanu is 58 and these guys are still moving so well. So impressive.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-07-29,"The fights in this movie are insane. Everybody is wearing super strong bulletproof vests, loved that. Great movie"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"The story for this franchise is getting deeper while the action gets even crazier. I can already see that the hand to hand combat in this movie is on another level. Knowing Keanu, he probably trained really hard for this."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-16,I love how everyone in this world knows that John is the most dangerous man alive but everyone also thinks they are the one that can kill him
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-03-24,Today is March 23 2024.... a year since this masterpiece debuted. I&#39;m hear to pay my respects.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"As good as this series is, the story, the action, the intricacies of it, I truly believe none of it would be possible without the unbelievable dedication of Keanu Reeves. He puts EVERYTHING on the table every time."

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-12,"I love that every movie in this series has an iconic muscle car attached to it‚Ä¶ the Chevelle, the Mustang, and now a Barracuda‚Ä¶ it all just adds to the badassery of Wick‚Äôs character."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-08-23,Superhero Movies like Deadpool 3 makes Billion dollars easily but people fails to appreciate a well made movie like John wick 4. they couldn&#39;t support John wick to make billion dollars.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,&quot;A man has to look his best when it&#39;s time to get married or buried&quot; Badass line from Laurence Fishburne
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,Keanu has made 2 of the greatest action and really movie Trilogies of all time. And he just keeps going. Underrated how far he has come as a talent.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-13,"John Wick is an amazing franchise. They know what the audience wants and they over deliver every time. So cinematic, so much fun. I cannot wait."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-06-26,"I just watched John Wick 4 last night and i was blown away on how good it was . Most franchises get terrible  after the second film , but this one just got better and better. The plots got more intricate , each  baddy was better than the previous one, every new character introduced , whether a small or large part , was superbly done by the actor and the fight scenes just got better and better. Now we all knew that this was to be the last John Wick film , but WOW what a final twist to the John Wick character  . Who would have seen that coming ? I tip my hat to all of those involved in the making , of this amazing film franchise."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,This might be a weird critique but I think what I love about this trailer the most is how well-lit all the scenes are. I‚Äôm tired of action movies/scenes being so dark and impossible to see. Being able to see every actor/stunt person in the scene makes the choreography and directing more impressive when you can actually see what‚Äôs happening.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,These films truly remind me of a time when franchises delivered every time. Thank you Keanu and all of the Wick squad.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"The sets, so big. The colors, so vivid. Every frame intriguing. Every shot, mesmerizing.<br>And a trailer that is trying to not give away the action, instead of the story."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-04-01,Lawrence Fishburne always dropping the hardest lines
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-12,I find it really amazing that this movie series has remained this consistently good for this long. maintaining such high level of quality seems to be an extremely difficult task for movie franchises to maintain
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-08,John wick Is the only movie I can watch over and over and never get tired of . Having 4 chapters means I can watch all 4 over and over and never be bored.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-15,"I think the best part of all movies is when Keanu says, &quot;I&#39;m going to need a gun.&quot; And no matter what, Morpheus or anybody is always smiling. So a wholesome moment."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-06-11,"Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane, Fishburne, Halle Berry are the best actors you could have put in John Wick and easily made it a solid entertaining fun film. Every single chapter was so fun to watch, filled with action and creative kills you just hope don&#39;t end! Keanu Reeves, just speechless over his incredible performance everytime which just gets better as the next John Wick releases. The cast was the best picks and had they been other actors it would not be as big and popular as it is, just wow. JW4 blew my high expectations out the window, the movie is the best action movie I have seen since JW3! Brilliant all around and to everyone included in making this masterpiece, this is a movie everybody remembers years ahead and it is so impressive that each chapter has been thoroughly entertaining throughout, there is no bad John Wick movie. This is a must watch!"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"This is a prime example of the  &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot; standard in filmmaking. 3 films in, and no lengthy, contrived exposition dumps. Just subtle, consistent, and meaningful worldbuilding, clinically precise and enticing dialogue, and nigh-perfect acting."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-04-06,I love how Keanu delivers each line as if it were the first words he has ever spoken.

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"The John Wick franchise is easily one of the greatest action series&#39;s ever to have blessed the screen. It&#39;s a triumph of story, stunt work, and is indeed Keanu Reeves&#39; legacy."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"Honestly, no matter how many sequels this great franchise gets, one thing&#39;s for certain for me... I&#39;ll never get bored of it!"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-13,"Just the fact that Neo, Morpheus, IP Man, Scorpion, and Pennywise The Clown are all in the same movie just shows you how great this movie is going to be!!! üòÆ"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-03-30,"I remember being in highschool when I watched JW3 waiting for JW4.

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-05-31,From the time where this movie has been out for quite some time: this movie is an actual work of art. It closes the book on John Wick&#39;s story beautifully and is held as the greatest action movie since The Raid
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,I just love how the creative team of this movie uses colors to compliment a particular scene. Absolutely beautiful!
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-06,‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need a gun.‚Äù<br>Good old Keanu Reeves quote.

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-05-29,"John Wick chapter 4 was explosive from start to finish. One man facing off a dozen highly trained assassins was mind-blowing. The whole franchise is 10/10, for sure."

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada with Keanu Reeves, in one movie. Just damn good."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2025-05-01,"I have watched many movies, and this is one of the only that I could watch on repeat and never get tired of, even with it being nearly 3 hours long."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,I just know the Donnie Yen fight is going to be legendary
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,The combat choreography in these movies never ceases to amaze me

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,The amount of lore we got on this absolute gem of a Franchise is just outstanding. You can easily make a pc game with multiple installments if they only cared about such a thing. Story is so rich and well written. Just magical...Thank you for reviving my love for cinema. Good cinema..
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-06,The choreography of this franchise and the wide shots. The pure trust the director has in the work is incredible and refreshing beyond belief. Best action and none if not majority of it isn&#39;t somewhat practical. Keanu moves like this at an actual range! The lore isn&#39;t given to you all magically and all at once. We thought we wouldn&#39;t have a sequel to the first and oh were we so so wrong. Can&#39;t wait for march.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-25,"This is one of those rare franchises that takes what it made from the first movie and just expands and expands without watering down anything. Over the top action, a decent story, and pure Keanu humbleness and finesse."

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,Bruh that Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada fight is going to be absolutely insane.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs almost 60 and he‚Äôs still one of the best stuntmen in all of Hollywood.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-09-20,"Personally I loved the tribute paid with the radio DJ, that‚Äôs stems right from the 1979 movie Warriors. Then you have the box of shotgun shells labeled dragons breathe going back to Keanu‚Äôs roll in Constantine when he was given dragons breath as a weapon, and of course you have Clancy brown playing the harbinger who says ‚Äúin the end only one remains‚Äù an homage to his 1986 film highlander where he played the Kurgan. I absolutely loved these little throw backs subtly put in there"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,Looks like Donnie Yen is going to have bigger role than we expected. We cannot wait for this! Excellent trailer.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"I&#39;ve always been a fan of Keanu&#39;s work, and this looks like it&#39;s gonna take it to the next level yet again. MY BODY IS READY"

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-12-22,"I loved the John Wick series, but this one is mt favorite.  The best of the series.  Best fight scenes, actors and story.  Plus I loved when Winston says Just have fun out there.  Also the scenes are memorable.  Especially when John kills the fat man, and John rises."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-04-03,The thing that makes John Wick movies different from other mindless action movies is the story is so well written with on point character development. It would be impossible to watch a guy killing people for almost 3 hours if not for strong set up and purpose. Every character is strongly anchored. Well done.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-03-18,Rest in peace Mr Lance Riddick <br>Charon will be greatly missed
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-15,"This trailer already has 38 million views. This shows how excited and hyped we really are for this March.<br><br>And around the time of filming, Donnie was 58, and Keanu was 57."

I was so wrong, I never thought it would come to this and boy I‚Äôm so pumped for this. Holy shit I‚Äôve never had this many likes before on anything. Thanks everyone."

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2024-02-28,Keanu Reeves was born to play John Wick. <br>Donnie Yen stole the show.<br>Bill Skarsgard was despicably brilliant.<br>Not a single character out of place and one of the best action movies and franchises ever
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"As much as I‚Äôd love 20 more John Wick films, I‚Äôd say a 5th and final one would be perfect to conclude the story by having him find his peace."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"Utmost respect for Keanu and his acting regiment, (what he does to prepare for a roll is far beyond the scope of most). As for a John Wick 4 - I can confidently say it is going to be as awesome as expected."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEVUtrk8_B4&amp;t=50"">0:50</a> when winston said his family sits at the high table i got chills i believe chapter 4 is going to be a heavily story driven one by that line alone we will likely see more of johns past or atleast get more info about it and even see his family"

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"Chad Stahelski is just making things better and better. I wanna see how much he can pull through this franchise, honestly he has chosen best. The cast, the music, the visuals. A franchise I can always rely to bring me to the movies."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-05-24,One of the GREATEST action movies in decades. There&#39;s on e scene late in the movie that has to be one of the greatest action scenes of ALL TIME. Must see for any person.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,No matter how many films this franchise gets I‚Äôll never get bored of it. I love the craziness and thrill each movie has brought and Keanu really delivers the performance every time!
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"This movie series is like fine wine, it&#39;s just getting better with time, just like Keanu. He is what made this movie series exciting and thrive to still have us wanting more after every one so far. I swear I got the chills when I saw the end of this trailer. I can&#39;t wait to see this one, then I&#39;ma rewatch all 4 like I did when the third one came out."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-12,"I have no idea how Keanu has managed to keep Hollywood from screwing up his movies, but I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s managed to keep them from screwing around with this franchise. It&#39;s epic."

John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"Probably the only modern-day movie sequels I haven&#39;t gotten sick of, can&#39;t wait to see Keanu and this new and old cast in action!"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-01-17,"I can&#39;t be the only one who never wants the Wick franchise to end, completely awesome!"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-07-18,Watched JW4 twice last week. Its the best action movie i have ever seen. We can watch all those action multiple time without getting bored.. And i like the way they give respect to all actors of this movie.. Especially Donnie Yen.<br>üî•üî•
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-16,The sheer fact that Donnie is in this movie and is going to go toe to toe with Keanu is enough to make me buy a ticket. This is going to be legendary
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"The Keanu vs Donnie fight looks badass already! Both of them are dual wielding gun + katana, whoever thought about that combo in a one to one fight is a genious. John Wick movies never fail to bring over the top but still grounded action üî•"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,Keanu not only walks amongst us‚Ä¶.he is beloved by his billions of fans‚Ä¶
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-12-02,One of the most awaited and biggest action movie of the Decade
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-07-14,"@lionsgate, I know you guys get thousands of comments and millions of emails but this is the greatest adventure I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. the aerial camera scene at the end is the greatest thing I have ever seen in any movie. Every single movie in this series keeps getting better and improving upon the previous one, I have no idea how you guys are doing it but thank you so much for your work. I am in love with the 4th one. You outdid yourselves. Everything is so stellar I&#39;m just at a loss of words and almost cried at points out of sheer amazement of your work. The first one was my favorite, then the second one, then the third one, and now this one. I don&#39;t even know how you keep on improving and finding unique takes on the series. I love your work. I also immensely love the blind guy starting in on the action at the beginning. It was so slick. This movie felt like something more than a movie and I&#39;ve never said that in my life. I kept on watching the third one over and over while waiting for this one. I actually waited to watch this one because I was savoring the moment as odd as that sounds. Every single moment of acting was literal perfection as well. I&#39;ll be watching this one for quite a while. You guys put me in another world while watching and thank you and thank you for reading my comment."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-11,"I dont care if they make chapter 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 i&#39;m still gonna watch them all. Love this franchise!"
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"That call out to Matrix with the &quot;I&#39;ll need a gun&quot; and Lawrence fishburne right next to it, you get me craving this movie."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,John Wick is one of those rare franchises where every single film in the franchise is bigger AND BETTER then the one that preceded it. This looks to be yet another example of it. I&#39;m glad that Keanu found a 2nd wind in his career and glad that he&#39;s getting all the love and respect that he deserves in this franchise/as a whole with the public. He truly deserves it. Can&#39;t wait for Chapter 4 and the Potentially planned Chapter 5.
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2023-07-15,"Wow....just wow.  The storyline and action was just amazing.<br><br>I love how they have Chinese, Japanese, African American, Middle Eastern and European all in this Super ACTION sequel.<br><br>I must say it&#39;s One of the Best or the Best ACTION Movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time.<br><br>Donnie Yen was Amazing in this movie so was the rest of the cast."
John Wick: Chapter 4,qEVUtrk8_B4,2022-11-10,"Much respect for Keanu. He is a rare talent who is also a genuine person in a world of fake, attention seeking celebrities. Comfortable and unashamed of just being himself."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-05,"My great grandmother was a victim of human trafficking during the chaos of Europe after ww1 at the age of 13. It ruined her life, and she was forever traumatised by what she experienced and saw. <br>She spent her whole life working to raise awareness for it. She would have been so happy to see this ."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-03,That line gave me chills. &quot;God&#39;s children are not for sale&quot;.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-18,"Even the trailer made me cry.  This isn&#39;t about being left or right, this is about humanity and our children."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-09-24,"The fact that, despite having numerous tries of taking it down, this movie went on to become one of the most successful independent films ever really shows how its message needs to be said and seen, showing how vile the media can be when trying to keep it silent."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-15,"This isn&#39;t just a movie, it is the reality of our world."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-11,"The fact that this didn‚Äôt get as much heat as it probably should, like on local TV, and ads, really speaks volumes. This movie looks great. And the message is even greater."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-08,"Just finished watching it, still sitting outside the theater... Honestly there&#39;s nothing you can say or do to do this movie justice. You have to see it for yourself."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2024-05-09,The fact that Hollywood was trying so hard to blacklist this movie says a lot.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-06-29,"The elites won&#39;t like this. Vote with your dollars, go see this movie."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-24,"its honestly disgusting and somewhat frightening the number of people attacking this film or trying to put it down, like you don&#39;t have to like the film but the message is something everyone should be able to get behind and rally around."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-29,The fact that theaters are trying to cancel this movie right now is disgusting. This movie is more than just a movie. It brings awareness to a lot of situations.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-27,Well done üëè üëè Finally watched here in Australian üá¶üá∫ cinema today‚Ä¶ Fantastic effort &amp; perseverance to get this to the big screen after 5yrs of Hollywood repression! The toll on Tim Ballard is immense. What he‚Äôs done - unbelievable üôèüëç
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-16,As a Mexican American it makes me really proud that a fellow Mexican directed this üôèüèΩüá≤üáΩshowcasing a heartbreaking reality to the world !
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-10,It needs to be shown in every country in the world.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-21,"In our theater tonight, not one person got up during the film. We all clapped at the end. It was an amazing experience."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2024-06-26,Everyone should watch this movie regardless of religion/beliefs! You don‚Äôt have to be on a side to agree that human trafficking and r@p1ng of innocent children is bad.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-20,Jim always taking on roles that he believes in. Doesnt matter if his career is on the line. Respect to this man
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-19,"Trafficking is NOT, as many media outlets would have us all think, a &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot; It&#39;s real and it&#39;s the most sickening crime under the sun. Hope Ghislaine Maxwell makes it out to see this one"
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-10,Ive just shared this with my local politicians and ask for this film to be shown in cinemas in the UK. Ive asked her to also support children that are being trafficked and to help save them.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-22,"This movie is such an amazing movie ! Me and my husband literally cried through out the whole movie people should be more aware of this kind of stuff that happens around us we should help in some way . So many of these children go missing about 500 , 000 thousand a year and that‚Äôs just in the US it‚Äôs extremely sad ."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-16,"This was probably the most important movie I‚Äôve ever watched. There were so many moments when anger took over me, wanting to do something about this darkness that plagues the Earth. And that‚Äôs precisely why the media doesn‚Äôt want you to watch it. To deter you from your righteous anger, because they know how powerful it is to act upon it."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-22,"Just watched the movie, its hard to watch without feeling anger inside, its heavy and very powerful and the entire world needs to tune in, the inspiration and motivation this movie took me by is on a whole new level. GODS CHILDREN ARE NOT FOR SALE."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-06,"If you are caught involved in child trafficking in anyway, shape, or form, swift death should be the punishment. The end."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2024-08-27,This is such an important and powerful film. Probably the most important film of our decade. Hollywood and the elite trying to silence the alarming message of this brillient film represents a pure crime against the children of this world. A must see for everyone who care about humanity and children on planet Earth.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-02,Jim Caviezel said he needs 2 million people to see this movie.<br>He will exceed  this and &quot; MUCH MORE&quot;
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-05,This movie was amazing and real...Shout out to Tim Ballard for his bravery and care for the children that motivated him to do this operation to rescue them.....üôå And to the actors.....they did an exceptional job Academy Awards and Oscars needed
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-03,‚ÄúGod‚Äôs children are no longer for sale‚Äù. So powerful üíïüíïüíïüíï
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-10-30,What an amazing movie. It has a deep message about the world we are living in. We have to raise our awareness and do what we can to prevent this discusting action of child trafficking because the elites will do everything to make it seem like their is no issue. The cancel culture we are living in...
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-08,Just got back from seeing it and I&#39;m glad ppl brought their little kids to see it. Not a dry eye in the theater. It helps bring even more awareness to the evil going on against innocent children. GO SEE IT! EVERY DOLLAR SPENT HELPS KIDS!
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-02,"Let&#39;s all unite in conciousness and action and STOP CHILD TRAFFICKING! This evil sick business MUST come to an end. In the mighty name of Jesus, may we the people come together as one, for the children&#39;s sake."

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-11-26,Every song by the children in this movie makes me cry. How painful it is to see these children turned into slaves by the demons out there. Everyone should watch this movie; it is truly heart-touching....&quot;
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-06-30,Terrifying... there are still those who don&#39;t believe the facts. This is more real than we think
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-22,Thank you YouTube and Google for allowing this film to be promoted and discussed. Thank you for letting people view and make up their own minds.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-07,Sadly human trafficing goes on all over the world. Everyone needs to do their part to end it. This is the fight we should be having instead of arguing over trivial stuff.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-09-20,Finally reached Philippines! And at the major cinemas. Just needs a bit more marketing here. There were only 3 of us watching the movie just this afternoon at Ayala Fairview Terraces Mall in Quezon City.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-11,This movie made me cry. You have to see it for yourself. This movie needs to be shown worldwide
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-16,I&#39;m rooting for this movie to arrive in Brazil.  We will do our part to make it a box office success and consequently raise awareness of more people.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-11,"Protect every and all children regardless of Gender, Etnicity, creed, skin color, age, and where they come from. It is about time we do our part to protect defenseless children."

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-19,Me and my girl shed tears multiple times watching this masterpiece. So sad. Everyone needs to go see this.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-13,Wow. Just saw this movie last night and it was incredible. It&#39;s truly heartbreaking seeing what this world has come to and the amount of sick people that surround us. They did an amazing job telling this story.

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-30,"This is the 1st film that really moved me since Harriet; it is very tastefully done with nothing being shown, only implied.    A big shout out to the Producer and all the stars involved.......they all did a wonderful job."

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-09-08,"A very powerful and evocative film. A harrowing but true story that illustrates well the massive difference one person can make with determination, fortitude and support. The true portrayal of a harsh reality. And what a man!! Yes it made us cry but was worth it. Go see it!  Gods children are NOT for sale!!"
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-19,Watched this multiple times! Cried each time.... There&#39;s never been a movie that hits this deep. Literally choking from my tears

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-08-01,We must protect our children! This film is a masterpiece!
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-15,"Just watched it yesterday, very powerful movie and eye opening for sure but after reading through comments it‚Äôs sad that a lot of people missed something huge. Cruise lines are a BIG part of this issue, the guy says it himself in the movie. Also when the kids are being transported via cargo ship, they show MSC in big bold letters. MSC is a transportation company but now also a cruise line. All the destinations that the movie shows, are popular spots for cruise lines to visit. We need to boycott the cruise lines, they have a big part in this and people missed it entirely! üò°üò°üò°"
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-09-09,Jim Caviezel is one of the most underappreciated actors of all time. <br><br>The Passion of the Christ and The Thin Red Line are some of the best films ever (the latter is one of my all-time favs)
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-31,Finally a film that leaves a message and makes the &quot;distracted&quot; politicians and humanity think
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-16,My parents went to go see this while on vacation in Florida. They said a lot of people had to leave the movie because it was too emotional. My dad even said he almost got up and walked out for some air.
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-16,Beautiful movie and even more beautiful and powerful message. Protect OUR children at all costs!
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-09-10,"This film actually had me in tears, it&#39;s such a powerful message the film carries, I&#39;m actually saddened that this still goes on today much worse than back in the slave trade days, for me this is film of the year 2023."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-19,"This movie is a great reminder of this tragic issue globally, as we all know that the issue is there, we tend to go on about our lives.

Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-24,"Fabulous movie, a must seen and shocking when you know it&#39;s real. Heartbreaking and emotional to see this. We need to raise the awareness as much as possible.¬†<br>At the highest echelons of success, there are individuals with considerable financial influence, a powerful public image, and more, who can also be involved in the most horrific activities. Probably one of the reason it was so hard to bring the movie out! Who are those clients?!! Disturbing and sad reality of our world! We need to protect our children."
Sound of Freedom,Rt0kp4VW1cI,2023-07-15,We want this movie to be shown throughout the world. Let the people know.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,You gotta give huge respect to Harrison Ford for playing one of his favourite roles at the age of 80 years old.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-08,"If stealing is the same as capitalism, then I guess Disney won‚Äôt mind if I pirate this movie."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-08,"Watching Indiana Jones as a kid in the 80s was the reason I became an archaeologist! It didn&#39;t last long admittedly: turned out arriving to work on horseback in sweaty, dirty clothes, being handy in a punch up, and pulling my female co-workers in a for kiss whenever they started shouting at me, didn&#39;t go down too well at the museum."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-12-14,"Im still in shock mode on how well he played his role as an 80 yr old man. He was running, jumping and doing alot of movements and yet he still executed it perfectly."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-05-22,Got chills when Indiana Jones handed the Elder Wand to Frodo and revealed &quot;I am your father.&quot; Stunning. My destiny has been dialed. 11/10
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-08,I wish Dr.Jones and Short Round ( Ke Huy Quan) had been in one more adventure together ü•∫ that would have been fantastic.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,"I&#39;ve been a fan of Indiana Jones for over 30 years. I never, <i>ever</i> imagined that there would be another movie, or at least one with Harrison Ford. It&#39;s insane that he&#39;s still doing this at his age. Hopefully they give him the sendoff he deserves."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-08-06,idk why but i really love the sequence when he jumps from one cart to another when he sees the car coming at him. its so satisfying to me
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,"I got chills when he says, ‚ÄúChewie, we‚Äôre home‚Ä¶‚Äù"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,I love Mads Michelson as a villain.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-12,I love the part where Poe says ‚Äúsomehow Indiana Jones returned‚Äù gave me force chills.
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2024-01-18,"We‚Äôll miss your adventures Indy. The ultimate kids hero in my eyes.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-07-23,Getting the Indiana jones trilogy VHS for Christmas in 1991 was one of my greatest memories. This movie farrrrrrr exceeded my expectations. AWESOME FILM.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-08,Lucasfilm throwing punches at capitalism has got to be some of the greatest irony to ever exist
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-08,The de-aging scenes of Harrison Ford in this movie looks pretty damn impressive...
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2024-03-11,"Despite being only 20, Indy was a huge part of my childhood all thanks to the Lego video games. I saw the trailer while waiting for the live-action Little Mermaid and I as quietly as I could LOST MY SHIT as soon as I heard the theme song."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-10,"I must admit, me becoming an archaeologist was pretty much 25% talking to my dad 25% loving history and culture 10% not liking other careers and 40% Indiana Jones."

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,"Just from Indy saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for this all my life‚Äù, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be a character arc where he has the temptation to use the dial to live in the past in his younger days but he chooses to resist that temptation and continue being an old man because he‚Äôs earned his age. Also Ford‚Äôs delivery of that line is great and gave the same feels as Chewie we‚Äôre home."

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-08-29,"After watching this in the cinema about 2 months ago, I honestly didn&#39;t understand the hate it received.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2024-09-21,"I loved this film. Seeing harrison don the costume again was alone pure bliss. 80 years old, running, jumping, swinging,  punching. The closure of Indy is closure for me. Raiders, Temple, Crusade, Crystal and Dial are the singularly most immaculate, passionate and joyful films ever created. Ill miss Indy, Salah, Shorty, Marion, Marcus, Mutt, Willy, Henry Senior and all the villians as well. 100% pure satisfaction  growing up, growing old with Indiana Jones. We, the kids from the 1980s, are the lucky ones. We got to see film in its purest, most creative state. From the character development, real action stunt work, special effects, blissful laughter to actual on site locations, in a nutshell, my own fedora is hats off to Spielberg, the entire cast and crews of all 5 movies. Thankyou, Harry. Thankyou."

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,"I remember walking into a movie theater in Manhattan in the 1980s to watch the first movie, not knowing what it was about and got dragged into it because the rest of the group wanted to see it. Boy was I in for the thrill of my life. Definitely the best movie of the year!"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,eQfMbSe7F2g,2023-04-07,I don&#39;t know why but I got very emotional as soon as the classic Theme started...like damn times are crazy right now and it&#39;s just so nice to see a familiar face again that gives you the positive impression of &quot;regardless which difficulties you are facing right now Indie is still here and you will see everything will be fine.&quot; Maybe it&#39;s just me but I&#39;m really thankful for the mere existence of this movie!

The way they brought us back with the original vibe in the opening was perfect and the story was amazing.<br>Also, I&#39;ve never watched a movie before in Theaters that got me so excited in its climax that I started laughing from how awesome and original it was towards the end.

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-21,I&#39;m here for Ilsa. Arguably the best written and performed woman as an action star in a long time.

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-17,"Tom Cruise is hands down the greatest entertainer that world cinema has seen over the last four decades! What he has achieved in terms of stunt choreography, VFX and sheer cinematic entertainment especially post MI 3 (including Maverick), can never be measured or rewarded enough by even The Oscars!"
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-07-16,"This movie is an absolute blast, start to finish. Fallout is still my favorite entry in the franchise, but Dead Reckoning right behind it. Luckily I didn&#39;t watch this trailer before watching the movie, because the train scene is so awesome and that zero-G moment literally took my breath away. I wish Part 2 is the last Mission to feature Ethan in the leading role. I hope it provides the epic conclusion to the Ethan Era the character deserves."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2024-11-05,This movie should have made way more money than it did. It was phenomanal!
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-07-20,"Saw this yesterday with my dad at Imax as a gift for his birthday. This movie is worth every penny! The storyline, narrative, film making and visual are fantastic. I have to say this was incredibly brave to do and without giving anything away, this trailer does a brilliant job at keeping it all secretive without spoiling it. It&#39;s a type of movie that requires a lot of attention and listening. The script writing is done very cleverly and actually gets away with what they are tackling. The stunts with the music is truly an experience worth having. It does feel different to the past few movies, and I would liken it to feeling more closely related to MI3, but the comedy saves it from getting overwhelming."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-17,&quot;war is coming&quot;  I have CHILLS

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-17,"Showing us how amazing the movie is going to be, but telling us near to nothing about the plot. That is how a trailer is meant to be, perfection!"
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-09-08,Tom cruise has been faithful since the first mission impossible in 1996 ... spectacular

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-17,Tom Cruise still not having an Oscar is one of the greatest injustices of humanity. Top Gun: Maverick proved that there is still room for the great cinematic events that mark an entire generation.

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,avz06PDqDbM,2023-05-23,It is nice how this franchise actually improves. Rogue Nation was the peak of it for me. As if they utilized the experience they got from all the previous movies and build upon so they give the audience something that does not disappoint.

The movie has a bold move on it&#39;s character, I loves how they made our heroes lose and they still not giving up on the mission. The Entity is suit for being an impossible mission."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-03,They should make a movie or series about Young Haymitches hunger games experience.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"Suzanne Collins really dropped a series that shaped a whole generation, disappeared, and appears again with another hit. This woman is like the equivalent of Adele."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,The way Snow says his line from Mockingjay part 1 gave me goosebumps &quot;It&#39;s the things that we love most that destroy us&quot;
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-19,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the things we love most that destroy us.‚Äù Now that I know exactly what he meant when he said that‚Ä¶ it breaks my heart ü•∫
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"This movie already sounded great, but casting Peter Dinklage as Casca was a stroke of genius. The man kills every role he is in!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"As a fan of the book, i approve of this trailer. They have already captured the tone and design of the book perfectly, now let‚Äôs see if they can capture the story and characters."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-30,Watching Snow&#39;s transition from a wanting-to-be-kind peacekeeper to the ruthless killer he was in the movies is gonna be a treat to watch
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-12-04,‚Äúenjoy the show!‚Äù always sends chills through me
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"The trailer looks amazing way better than what I was expecting, the fact that they stayed true to Lucy Gray&#39;s southern accent made me so happy, the arena looks so eerie  and Donald Sutherland voice at the end tying everything together chef&#39;s kiss, I&#39;m so excited for this film"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,I LOVE the little detail that Lucy gray was the one to create the hanging tree song that Katniss sings. Just another dagger in Snow&#39;s heart so many years after.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-29,"Just finished the book (literally two minutes ago) so ofc I had to run to this trailer. I&#39;m very excited but a little worried, just because of how vital Snow&#39;s inner monologe is in the book. It&#39;s crazy how often I found myself root for him and then snap out of it, at least until the last third of the book. But even then, some of his interactions were still morally &quot;good&quot;. Crazy good writing tbh. everyone&#39;s a good guy in their own mind and Collins captured that mental divide between Snow&#39;s actions and his thought patterns perfectly. So i hope they find a way to accurately portray this in the movie!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-12-31,"This film certainly was one for the fans. Giving us an amazing backstory to Snow, all the while providing an entertaining and exhilarating atmosphere, and the ‚Äòanti-Katniss‚Äô, Lucy Grey. What a beautifully made film. I enjoyed every minute. üî•"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,Telling Snow‚Äôs backstory in the big screen? I‚Äôm all in for this he‚Äôs probably the most intriguing part of the Hunger Games story for me.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"Viola Davis playing the psychotic villain in this looks like she had fun with it.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,Lucy&#39;s bow gave me goosebumps. The similarities between Katniss and Lucy is what I am looking forward to most in this movie.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"as a fan of the book this looks PERFECT. perfect casting, scenes in the trailer look exactly how i pictured them in the book, the whole vibe of the early capitol.. so excited"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-15,I never read the books. But I know that her Hanging Tree song was about Snow. Her being a player for D12 and singing that song must‚Äôve made things hard when he went against Katniss. Katniss used the song to be about rebellion and it was used against him. And a player from D12 who bows similar to Lucy.<br><br>I‚Äôm so excited to see this movie!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,The capitol visually looked like it was set in a dystopian 1950s. I love how the arena looks and the casting is literally perfect. But seriously though did anyone notice how much panem looks like it&#39;s set in a futuristic version of the 50s
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-09-02,‚Äú It‚Äôs the things we love most that destroy us ‚Äú snows line so iconic I wanna rewatch all the hungers games now üò≠
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-09-22,"So I‚Äôm currently reading the book, chapter 8, and  I‚Äôm really loving how much of an unreliable narrator Snow actually is. He is beyond delusional, which works really well in writing. I am a little concerned of how well that will actually translate on screen. He‚Äôs very good at saying all is right, empathetic, things, and dialogue, but his internal thoughts are would give away how absolutely out of touch. I really hope they do a good job conveying all of this without excessive voiceover. I also can‚Äôt wait for all of their fucking names to be said out loud, because I can‚Äôt pronounce a single one of themmmmmm"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-19,"Fantastic film, the way they brought snows demise to evil was brilliantly done."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-01,"Still shocked at the no reappearance of District 8 Hospital Helper, a phenomenal actor who deserved to be seen more in the big screen. No matter where he currently is or doing, I hope he finds the same success and fame as he once had."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,Knowing Rachel Zegler did that bow as a homage to Katniss‚Äôs ‚ÄúThank you for your consideration‚Äù bow in the first Hunger Games movie is such a treat for the fans. Another hint Lucy Gray Baird is Katniss Everdeen‚Äôs ancestor
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-04,"I was a kid when the hunger games first dropped so to be older and still having that same love for the hunger games series, it‚Äôs truly pure nostalgia to sit and watch another gem made with a full bucket of popcorn. Thank you Suzanne."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-22,Tom Blyth as young Coriolanus Snow was simply brilliant.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,the book was so damn good it left me with goosebumps. highly recommend reading it before watching the movie!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,Bringing Snow&#39;s story to the light was a stroke of genius at least now we know why Snow is the way he is
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-01,"The  nostalgia hits hard, I cant wait for this. Very interested with Snow&#39;s backstory knowing how messed up he turned out to be. And donald sutherland&#39;s voiceline was the bomb, he played snow so damn well."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-28,"Having now watched the movie I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. Cool to know that Daddy Snow partly came up with the idea for the hunger games and Coryo changing the games to what we get in the Hunger Games movies. Also, some great performances all around; Viola Davis as Gaul was great, she was unhinged and overacted in the best way"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"Wow, Rachel Zegler is really going places. From musicals in high school to starring in huge movie franchises. You go, girl!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-05,"It is very good that they even touched Capitol aestethics. While in Katniss&#39; timeline, Capitol people having extravagant fashion with too many plastic surgeries. But in Snow&#39;s youth, their style resembles retro and they wear more modest clothing. Such a good detail üëçüèª"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-01,One of the things I always hated about dystopians was their focus on character love stories instead of the interworkings of the world. So I‚Äôm really pumped about learning the history and lore behind the world we saw in the og trilogy

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2025-01-28,"Dear Suzanne Collins, here would be my requests for more hunger games books:<br>1) Hunger Games from Peeta‚Äôs perspective <br>2) A book/s for each of the victors that came back in catching fire<br>3) Specifically, a book about Finnick‚Äôs first hunger games experience <br>4) A book long epilogue to the main hunger games series with katniss and peeta and their kids."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"See, this is how you do it! You take a franchise/saga and you explode its potential by deepening in its story background, looking on the past and future of it. You don&#39;t make a new version of something that already exist! I&#39;m loving this new way of watching the Hunger Games world, thank you! I was really missing this type of dystopian movies!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-03,I&#39;m surprised at how accurate the trailer seems for a book adaptation. I hope it will get to impress me as much as the book did
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"&quot;It&#39;s the things that we love most that destroy us&quot;... Now it all makes sense. Why Snow is the way he is. I don&#39;t want to spoil the movie for those who haven&#39;t read the book, but if you have read it, then you know what I mean by this. I can&#39;t wait to see the movie!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2024-08-12,"Only just watched this movie, loved it! Was already understandable why Snow hated Katniss but knowing this back story makes it even more ironic. Another strong willed girl from District 12. And when she started singing that song I can not imagine how that impacted Snow!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,I was a child who loved The Hunger Games back in the 2010s. Now I‚Äôm a college student eagerly awaiting this new film.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"there&#39;s just nothing that does it for me like dystopians do...

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-29,"I can not tell you how terrified I was when this was announced because I didn‚Äôt want them to ruin it, but after watching the trailer I am literally so excited. The book was really good so hopefully this will be too."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2025-04-03,"This film was the most truthful adaptation of its source. Almost everything happened like It was in book. I was amazed, I never saw something like that. Every movie adaptation of a book makes changes."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,I was expecting the film to be good but WOW this actually looks brilliant and way better than what I was expecting.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-09-24,"Back here after reading the book. Never was I so repelled by a protagonist, but invested in their story all the same. Learning about the hanging tree was so satisfying, thinking how Katniss would have annoyed him with her Mockingjay pin and the song ü§£"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-02,"For those of you who think this story will be about a good guy becoming the villain because of past traumas, give the movie a chance... You&#39;ll be surprised. The protagonist is not only well developed, there are also quite interesting secondary characters"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2025-04-04,I don‚Äôt like her as Snow White ..But I admit she did a great job in this movie ..

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"Honestly didn‚Äôt imagine the stadium to look like this in comparison with the book, but I‚Äôm all for a compact arena. The snake scene‚Äôs gonna be epic."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-25,i really thought they deaged Stanley Tucci to play the announcer but then i looked it up and realized it was Jason Schwartzman. This movie was great.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-03,"Just that BOW that Lucy Gray does is absolutely incredible. Rachel captured it perfectly.<br><br>Also, the use of the &quot;It&#39;s the things we love the most that destroy us&quot; line and the mockingjay song at the very end? GENIUS! Not to mention Viola Davis!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-29,"From the trailer it seems like they will fit the entire book into one movie. Wasn‚Äôt sure if they would try to split it up into two parts. I am very excited! As criminal as this sounds, Snow has always been my favorite character. Such a sophisticated character, and Donald Sutherland portrayed that so well!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-05,I just finished the book minutes ago and this trailer gave me chills omg I‚Äôm so excited - I‚Äôve been a hunger games superfan since 2012 and I got this book in 2020 and never got around to actually reading it.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,One of the best hunger games books in the series. I really hope the movie will do the book justice! It is truly a brilliant story. Susan Collins is a genius!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDE6Uz73A7g&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> I love this shot because it shows more of a connection between Katniss and Lucy"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-07-13,I can picture the ending showing a transition from young Snow looking at a photo of Lucy to old Snow as he prepares to talk to Katniss  in the scene where the rebels raid the tribute center and it ends with him giving the line ‚Äúit‚Äôs the things we love most that destroy us!‚Äù Now with the audience understanding the meaning of the line.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2024-07-01,"Hearing &quot;It&#39;s the things we love most that destroy us,&quot; hits different now. R.I.P. Donald Sutherland."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-01,"These books are so difficult to put to screen given how deeply they&#39;re about someone&#39;s inner most thoughts and trauma, but the shot at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDE6Uz73A7g&amp;t=109"">1:49</a> has sold me to at least see this once. That&#39;s a gorgeous shot and is very in line with the book. The last third of this should be really great viewing on the big screen if they can do the tension right. The cast seems great."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,I think I can speak for everyone when I say how excited I am for this movie!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-10-06,"I just finished the book and the trailer is very accurate to what I read. Its so cool how you can see parts of the hunger games we know splashed around on the pages of the book! My favorite line from the book was in the trailer and it is, &quot;Do you hear that, Coriolanus? It&#39;s the sound of Snow falling.&quot; Its just so powerful!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-11-18,"This movie is absolutely now one of my favourites, it was so, so incredible!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"Viola Davis&#39;s laugh and echo at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDE6Uz73A7g&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> is so unnerving and menacing - I can&#39;t wait to see her play the role of a crazy villain... it&#39;s definitely a perfect casting"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,When young Snow said &quot;I do my best to take care of you&quot; with the head tilt and eyebrow raise. I was immediately convinced that it was Snow. The actor already has me sold!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-05-09,"Is anyone else watching this trailer and not seeing actors, but only seeing real, fleshed out characters? Everyone just looks exactly like the legendary Suzanne Collins described them!!! Oh my god I&#39;m so excited!!! Really hope they justice to the masterpiece that is this book."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-12-16,Watched the movie today.Absolutely incredible!!Love how the movie captures the character development of Snow.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-28,"The part where Dinklage turns to the camera and says &quot;You snow nothing, John Snow&quot; literal chills"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-30,Where is District 8 hospital helper??? He was the glue that held this franchise together!

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-30,I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt include the most iconic character of the Hunger Games franchise: District 8 Hospital Helper played by the great actor Charles White
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"ALL OF THE DIALOGUE THATS TRUE TO THE BOOK, THE COSTUME CHOICES, SET DESIGN, OMFG ITS GOING TO BE AMAZING"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-30,"This movie looks incredible.<br>It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t see the opportunity to bring back district 8 hospital helper. I would&#39;ve loved to see his backstory and learn how his early  life shaped him into becoming the man he was. Perhaps they&#39;re planning a spin-off movie (TV show?) for his character, I don&#39;t see any other real explanation for how the producers could leave such a massive gap in the franchise."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-12-06,I saw it opening night. It was so so so good!!!! 9.5/10
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-30,There is a severe lack of District 8 Hospital Helper.
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,"A lot of these scenes look very similar to how I pictured them in my head while reading the book. That&#39;s always a very good sign, I&#39;m so pumped!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2023-04-27,Francis Lawrence always for the win!!! Brings his ideas and his vision to life! Not one of his movies has ever disappointed me! Became a fan of his for the hunger games catching fire. he will always be my favorite filmmaker! So glad they brought you back!
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,RDE6Uz73A7g,2025-02-13,"I was at the theater to watch another movie and saw the preview for this. I knew from the first note of music something was coming. That music is so iconic to the franchise, this did not disappoint."

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"No matter how people feel about the Transformers movies, we can&#39;t deny that Peter Cullen IS Optimus Prime. The role of a lifetime that he was born to play, would be a sad day if he&#39;s gone"

Overall, I am looking forward to the release of the new Transformers movie and can&#39;t wait to see it in action."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,Respect to the camera crew traveling back 30 years in time to film this and bringing the footage back to us.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,Optimus&#39;s voice never gets old no matter how many times you&#39;ve heard it
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-08-12,"Go! Go! Go! Thanks for the new movie! Thanks for new life for my favourite Transformers! It has so much style!

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"I&#39;m tearing up. My best friend was a fan of Transformers OG(way more than me, I was more a &quot;Beast Wars&quot;kid growing up). She passed away before she could see Bumblebee or the actual film version of Unicron(the other movie said he WAS Earth, which made her so angry). Wish she was here to see this. Seeing the Maximals for me is so nostalgic as well."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"It‚Äôs like opening your toy box if you‚Äôre a Transformers fan from the ‚Äò80‚Äôs/‚Äò90‚Äôs and just going out in the yard to play, but now it‚Äôs on the big screen for everyone to enjoy üòä together at once with each other from both generations of Transformers fans."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-08-26,This one is awesome. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-05-08,"One of the thing, I liked about this trailer is that is that Autobot&#39;s size is how big they should be according to their vehicle form ."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"I actually like that Unicron is being introduced earlier on. It could give the writers a chance to use other big bads of the franchise, like the Vok, BW Megatron or an evil prime"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-06-01,"transformers have always been my favorite action movies, it will never change. and the fact peter cullen is still voicing optimus is absolutely amazingüëè"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-10-29,"To me this was just a nice and simple Transformers movies. Nothing to crazy and it gets right to the point pretty fast. I will say after all the Transformers movies, the special effects team finally got it right. The Transformers fighting doesn&#39;t look like twisted metal like the earlier moves"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-07-12,"The Bumblebee scene when the plane doors open and after its the best, and made it my favourite one so far"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-30,"I might be a grown man with family, responsibilities, work, tensions but when it&#39;s these movies, I am still a child. Can&#39;t wait!! This one is going to be a blast!!"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2024-01-08,I think it&#39;s cool that Anthony Ramos is doing something non-musical related.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"The recent death of Kevin Conroy made me realize the mortality of some of our favorite celebrities. Peter isn‚Äôt going to be around forever, and if this is his last time voicing Optimus, I thank him for literally voicing my childhood"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-05-12,"One fun fact about Peter Cullen is that he was inspired to create the voice of Optimus Prime after his brother, who was a Marine Corps drill instructor. Cullen has stated that his brother&#39;s commanding voice and way of speaking influenced his portrayal of the heroic Autobot leader. Additionally, Cullen&#39;s deep, resonant voice has made him a sought-after voice actor, and he has provided voices for many other popular animated shows and video games, including the character of Eeyore in Disney&#39;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh.&quot;"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-28,Those who felt goosebumps When Optimus said &quot;let them come&quot; ‚úãüòÇ
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2025-01-14,I really am thankful for The Transformers movies because me and My Mom we love Transformers
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-05-01,Seeing Acree and Wheeljack fighting together really does remind me of an episode of transformers primne. This movie is definitely going to be a blast!
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-29,I Watched 90s beast wars in 2000s it was my first introduction to transformers. This film has everything i need as a transformers fan. Visuals are off the charts and it looks insanely crisp than any other film coming out this years
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-29,I remember watching the original cartoon when I was in college. When class finished I would race across campus back to my dorm to watch Transformers. And I am still a huge fan. Optimus is my hero. ‚ÄúLet them come.‚Äù
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2024-07-23,"Thanks to Peter Cullen for his role as Optimus Prime for many years, he&#39;s a living legend! Yep, definitely pay respect for him!"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"My jaw dropped when I saw Unicron. Finally a live adaptation of him.<br>I&#39;m happy that Wheeljack has the fins now, hopefully by the end of the movie he ditches the glasses and scans a better car."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-05-07,"I am proud of Peter Cullen to still voice for Optimus Prime, He is a living LEGEND!"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,I don‚Äôt care if the transformers movies are bad or get bad reviews<br>But the action and the special effects make it so worth watching <br>Super excited for this movie
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-10-23,‚ÄúDont do it Prime i can give everthing you want‚Äù -Unicron
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,I‚Äôm so glad they gave wheeljack his ear pieces back! Personally I think it adds so much to his look and now I can actually recognize him as wheeljack lol
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-28,Wow I really didn‚Äôt expect Unicron to be in this movie. The hype is even more insane.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,I literally gasped out loud when Unicron showed up. This movie is going to be insane.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"I&#39;m honestly not expecting to see a robot mode for Unicron, but, it&#39;s still pretty cool to see a pretty accurate looking planet mode of him."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,Let&#39;s just all be thankful Peter Cullen is still well enough to lend his talent yet again. He&#39;s a living legend.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"The action sequences and special effects were far better then from it&#39;s previous parts, so happy to see it."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itnqEauWQZM&amp;t=86"">1:26</a> That shot of bee was badass"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-09-11,I really enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the other Transformers movies.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"I can&#39;t stop loving Optimus Prime&#39;s voice , What a legend Peter Cullenüî•üî•üî•"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,"Can&#39;t wait to hear Peter Cullen once more as Optimus, His voice elevates everything to another level. Looks incredible."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-04-27,Words cannot even describe how hyped I am for this movie!! A whole childhood dream coming true ! This definitely will be an amazing movie June 9 cannot come any sooner!!!!
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-09-10,I just watch it on Paramount+ and I LOVE IT 12/10!!
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,itnqEauWQZM,2023-05-02,Anyone else get goosebumps when optimus said &#39;let them come&#39;
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I can respect this, it‚Äôs no longer about the past of rocky meeting the present, it‚Äôs all about Adonis and his own life. Can‚Äôt wait for this to hit theatres!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-20,Jonathan Majors has a certain ferocity while also being sympathetic and tender in these roles. He&#39;s an amazing actor
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I love the fact that Major‚Äôs character is an old friend of Adonis that went to prison. Think that‚Äôs such a great twist and can have huge emotional impact when they do fight, if done right. Look‚Äôs like Majors is playing almost a Tyson like figure."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-18,I went to the cinema to watch this yesterday and it was an amazing film. I personally would say it&#39;s the best out of the 3 Creed films so far. I&#39;d highly recommend watching it especially in a cinema on a big screen. That 3rd round between Creed and Dame at the end where everyone disappeared but them was mind blowing how it was filmed I was like a little kid again watching Rocky. Great film and for Michael B Jordan directorial debut it was a masterpiece.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,The first creed came out in a time of my life where I needed motivation. I love both Rocky and Creed.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"This looks doooope. Congrats to Micahel B. Jordan for his directorial debut and I&#39;m so thrilled to see the rise of Jonathan Majors, he&#39;s become one of my favorite actors."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-20,"&quot;I need you to let go of your fear, let go of the guilt, let go of whatever was, and walk into what is &quot; .... omg the chills I get from this line !!!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-02-04,Man this Kang is in every multiverse
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Love Majors‚Äô acting even in these small snippets. That smiling exterior contrasted with a lifetime of hurt and loss that he just barely keeps under the surface. He‚Äôs practically got layered antagonists down to a science
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-22,"One thing that a lot of people don&#39;t talk about but can be noticed in this trailer is the evolution of Duke Jr, he was ignorant with Adonis in the first movie and in the sequel he wasn&#39;t experienced enough to train him for the first Drago fight, now, he finally seems to have the balance to become a perfect manager, just like his father was for Apollo and Rocky, pretty awesome."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-12-10,"I remember taking my father to the movie theaters to see Creed when he was in good health. I remember taking him to see Creed 2 when his health started to decline. Though I can‚Äôt physically take him with me to see Creed 3, I know he will be there and this will be a tough one to watch especially. But very excited for the progress of these films and Michael B Jordan is killing it. Stay humble folks"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-02-09,"I worked on this movie towards the ending of filming last year and I‚Äôm still pinching myself over it, such a surreal and positive experience, everyone involved was so dope üôè"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I thought I would miss seeing Rocky in this trailer, but the introduction of Major&#39;s character is a great angle to explore. Smart move. I feel like Creed 3 will really step out of the shadows and be its own entity. So hyped!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"Love how this story has been progressing: In the first 2, Adonis grew into his own person, learning victory and humility. Now that he‚Äôs fully at the top, Damian‚Äôs coming in to challenge Adonis on whether or not he <b>deserves</b> his life. Brilliant story telling."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-25,That change in Majors‚Äô facial expression when he says ¬´¬†thank you¬†¬ª is elite !
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-03,"Such a great film! Congratulations to Michael B. Jordan and his directorial debut, you can tell he put everything he had into this. I was blown away!!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"Despite not having Rocky back this time around I think it‚Äôll still be great. Rocky‚Äôs story already came to an end and he‚Äôs passed the torch on to Adonis. Now this time around it‚Äôs really a personal battle, maybe even more so than the Drago fight. There‚Äôs a lot of history here, and it seems like it‚Äôs definitely be a great character piece. Can‚Äôt wait to see it"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I like the fact that this film is going in its own lane and not being predictable. Its sort of leaving the rocky and apollo shadows behind in a respectful way, even in the trailer at the gym it has written on back wall &quot;build your own legacy&quot; and this film is doing just that. Excellent job!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-21,"2023 is a big year for Jonathan Majors, so happy for him and Congrats to Michael B. Jordan for his directorial debut!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-03,Jonathan Majors is such an amazing actor.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"‚ÄúLet go of you‚Äôre fear, let go of the guilt, let go of whatever was and walk into what is‚Ä¶‚Äù üíØ"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"Jonathan Majors is perfect for a villain who  acts friendly with a smile, but it has a double/hidden meaning, and it comes off eerie because it&#39;s too friendly with his calm demeanor. And only later do we see the true nature (evil/anger) behind it. Not evil in this movie, I&#39;m mainly referring to Kang."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,When Major‚Äôs say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in the diner‚Ä¶ I seen the switch. That little nuanced bit of acting is so good! These two will push each other beyond a ‚Äúfight‚Äù movie!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-04,"Just watched Creed 3 and it is amazing, Michael B Jordan&#39;s directorial debut is perfect, the movie is shot so well, the story, fights everything was excellent üëèüëèüëè Jonathan Majors stole the show as Dame üôå"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-26,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=120"">2:00</a> &quot;I need you to take away all the fear, the guilt, let go of whatever was and walk into what is.&quot; Such a powerful quote.<br>Edit: Changed the quote cause you guys said it was wrong and it actually was."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Been with this franchise since I was a little kid and I love the fact that they are still around for kids nowadays.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-16,"A fantastic trailer. You can sense dread when Damien shows up, and it becomes more and more clear that he is the greatest threat and a nemesis for Baby Creed. Even taking him under his wing, doesn&#39;t matter. This has a very realistic feel about it"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,Looks like a great movie.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"I need you to let go of your fear , let go of the guilt , let go of whatever was &amp; walk into what is ‚Ä¶. Powerful üëè"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-20,"Cant lie, jonathan majors being in this gave me chills, from the trailer alone you can tell he&#39;s fit the role real good, congrats to MBJ for is directorial debut, this film looks like its going to be epic!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-04-09,"This movie got butchered in editing.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> Press conference was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=35"">0:35</a> Adonis and Damian entering the diner was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=62"">1:02</a> Damian being made fun of for his electronic ankle bracelet was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> Damian being too aggressive in sparring was cut (final film shows him giving a unsportsman hit that is not clearly shown at all)<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> Damian slamming his gloves together after Felix was already knocked out (good to portray Damian&#39;s unstable character) was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> Adonis looking in the mirror was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=113"">1:53</a> Adonis having an ice bath was cut<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> Adonis in prison was cut (all the prisoners are young so seems like Adonis was visiting his old juvenile prison to make peace with his past)<br><br>Plus Damian&#39;s character was underdeveloped. I would have loved to see some footage of him in prison, hitting the heavy bag or sparring, just something. I also thought the part where him and Adonis meet on the beach after his win against Felix was weird, Adonis just somehow knew he would be celebrating there.<br><br>I loved all the previous films but this one was weak."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"A little hesitant to not see anything related to Rocky‚Äôs history at first, but this is Creed‚Äôs legacy now. His own story with an opponent from his own past with nothing to lose. Major‚Äôs character Damien is seen always alone in his training and even down to the showdown with no one in his corner, while Creed has everything he needs. Perfect story of ‚Äúeverything on the line‚Äù VS ‚Äúnothing to lose‚Äù. This is gonna be fun"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"Wait a frickin minute, that‚Äôs ‚Äúhe who remains‚Äù himself Jonathan majors. Pretty awesome he is in it."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Jonathan Majors is a tremendous get for the movie. He‚Äôs truly an incredible actor
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-10,Watched the other day. Loved it!  The acting was on another level.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,I can‚Äôt wait for this movie. This entire franchise has received countless accolades and I have great reverence for it as well. The bad guy for this movie looks pretty formidable too.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"Now this is what I‚Äôm talking about, a brand new story that doesn‚Äôt follow a lot of the Rocky story but still acknowledges it. <br>No sons of passed characters, and no ties that butchers the rocky legacy. Can‚Äôt wait to see this."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,gotta say im proud of michael having this movie as his directional debut. It already lookss OUTSANDINGS
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-04,Majors has a way of sealing pure rage in a smile. Untill he&#39;s standing over you like a beast
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I loved both Creed movies and honestly I really hope this lives up to those.  And honestly I do get the idea of making this one; though the first Creed was about Adonis proving he is his own person and can get his own shot and II was about facing the demons of his father&#39;s legacy not drag him down in what he wants to do, it did feel like we needed a movie specifically about an enemy and an obstacle that relates squarely to him and something he couldn&#39;t just rely on a mentor helping him get past.  Like Rocky has a really great ending in Creed II to his story so I get wanting to separate him from this story and have it be about something specifically Adonis went through."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"The conflict is giving Warrior (2011) vibes. About time we got that plot again, it&#39;s a great plot that deserves to be reinterpreted!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"Holy crow, Jonathan Majors absolutely killing it in this trailer. I don&#39;t think you could get much more of a polar opposite from his work on Lovecraft Country than what you see here. Don&#39;t know that he&#39;ll outshine MBJ, but he&#39;ll definitely give him a run for his money in every respect!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-05-11,"This movie was great!! The back story, cinematography, the action and acting was incredibleüí™"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"The intensity of majors face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=119"">1:59</a> is just woah. That is the face of all that pain and rage held in finally coming out. Can‚Äôt wait for this movie"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"Just from looking at the trailer, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs fighting his old self and breaking free of all of the ‚Äúsubconscious‚Äù holds‚Ä¶ like the battles we go through with ourselves on a daily"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I feel like this movie came in just the perfect time for me. I&#39;ve been working out to get from thin to fit, and this movie is gonna motivate me to another level."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-14,You can certainly see the heartbreak in Damian‚Äôs eyes
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-21,"I noticed how, at the end scene in this trailer, there&#39;s whole team around Adonis, concerned about him, giving him advice, carrying for him, and there&#39;s Dame, he&#39;s standing alone, there&#39;s no one behind him, no team, no word of encouragement. He grove up as a bully with no guidance. I know many people with sad story like this one. Feel sory for this movie character already. Jonathan is very good at his job."

Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"For anyone who has seen Spiderman TAS from the 90s, this reminds me of the episode where we learn about Robbie&#39;s and Tombstone&#39;s past. As kids, they committed a crime, but only one got caught. It showed how different their lives were from that one incident."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> the smile change shows how great his acting ability is. <br>-Some people are envious of the fact that you have the ability to give them something and they want to be in that seat to do it just because. <br>People that can‚Äôt play their position, they need to be the BOSS. These are people you can‚Äôt have around you.<br>You could give them everything they couldn‚Äôt get on their own and they‚Äôll hate you for it. They hate receiving but love giving.<br>It‚Äôs a Good prayer coming from a sick and poisonous place."

Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Was skeptical of them doing a 3rd movie because I wasn&#39;t sure where they could go after having Creed conquer Drago. Seemed like a great way to wrap the story. But this looks fantastic. Excited to see the direction the story goes in. This has so much potential to be great! Let&#39;s go!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"This is great! It&#39;s a perfect and original story, no longer is this new Creed franchise hindering on the Rocky legacy, it&#39;s now really opening up to its own path."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-20,"‚ÄúLet go of you‚Äôre fear, let go of the guilt, let go of whatever was and walk into what is‚Ä¶‚Äù  100%!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2025-01-18,The crazy thing is that Michael B. Jordan directed the movie. That‚Äôs crazy.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-10,"That initial monologue is powerful, it works both narratively and in terms of the creative process. Creed 1 and 2 were still revolving around the Rocky mythos, this is the first truly independent story,  not tied to Rocky and his rogue‚Äôs gallery. Pumped for this film."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,So proud of Michael B. making his directorial debut and especially for the end of the Creed trilogy. This gonna be something special fr
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-21,These movies will never get old!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-18,"....Let me say this right here..This movie, hands down one of the greatest!! Just checked it out today.  MICHAEL B. JORDAN,  took care of business directing and starring in this movie. He deserves and praying that next year, he will receive 2 Oscar&#39;s  , one for acting and directing. The pictures, lighting, acting, everything, and I do mean everything was so on point., also a few funny moments. So very proud of MICHAEL B.JORDAN. OUTSTANDING JOB DONE! OUTSTANDING!  COUNTDOWN TO THE OSCAR&#39;S. WELL DESERVING OF A MAN,THAT IS SO HUMBLE, SMART,KNOWLEDGEABLE, NICE , RESPECTFUL AS MICHAEL.  Cheers to you Mr. Jordan,  Cheers!!!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Props for Michael. He just stepped up his game with directing this movie. Looks like a great movie.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"every time i&#39;ve seen jonathan majors, i feel like i missed out not knowing more of his work before. i feel like jonathan is really a denzel and sam jackson level of skill and presence. excited to see all his work in the near future."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,This almost like what Rocky V should have been about and I&#39;m already loving how this movie is turning out
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-02-04,Can we please acknowledge Johnathan Majors. His come up is immaculate.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-21,I hope they also develop the Drago and his son storyline as well.  In Creed II seeing how Drago&#39;s son was so upset about how his mother abandoned them and they were left to fend for themselves.  That was the most emotional part of the story for me.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> when creed took a beating he had people in his corner. When majors took one in the next shot he‚Äôs all alone. Man this is gonna be emotional"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-04-03,I gotta say  the movie was so good that I watched it. Came back watch the trailer and fina watch it again. No words can describe this movie üòÆ
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"The fact that Ryan Googler is back on writing ( he directed the first creed and wrote it&#39;s story) is already promising. Creed 2 was great, but relatively simple as a story and pretty predicable! Hope we get to see another long take of a fight"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Jonathan Majors is legit one of the best actors around.  can&#39;t wait for this.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"Two Kings, Two Phenomenal actors, this will be a masterpiece PERIOD."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-04-09,Such a good movie - and I LOVE that he wore Apollo&#39;s colors and the stars in the final fight.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-12-21,"That moment at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHmCH7iB_IM&amp;t=49"">0:49</a> where Jonathan Majors switches from smiling to serious in an instant. That is acting. This dude is going to be an amazing villain!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-03,"Good time to be alive when I can find and watch any Rocky movie in seconds and new Creed movies are still coming out. idk if it‚Äôs the music, how emotional the stories are, or what. I love this franchise."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I don&#39;t know how good/great this will be, but I&#39;m 100% going to see it in theatres."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-03,Majors just looks like he snaps in this movie. Im here for it.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-24,I can&#39;t stop watching this trailer. The acting is so good and the way they set it up.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"KILLMONGER VS KANG THE CONQUERER.<br>In all seriousness, I love the Creed franchise. I can&#39;t wait to see the third entry in the trilogy."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"Awesome premise! They could have went the easy route and have Clubber Lang&#39;s son (or something similar to that) wanting to get his shot but no, an original idea. There were 3 years between Creed 1&amp;2. You can tell they took that extra year to put together a really good script...so looking forward to this!!! I know MBJ is going to do an amazing job in the director&#39;s chair too."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-04,I will go see this movie on Sunday I&#39;m a huge fan of Creed movies since when I was born I still like them
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-15,I really see this becoming a success because it‚Äôs really as if Adonnis is truly stepping out of that shadow of his father and Rocky and really creating his own legacy. I think going to see this movie in theaters it‚Äôs really important to be aware that this is Creed‚Äôs story &amp; this is his journey with his family and peers. Creed 3 is only the beginning of the Creed collection!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"I&#39;m looking forward to this, the rocky movies were great, the transition over to Creed has been excellent as well as subtle, and now also the transition into a standalone franchise away from Rocky is also great, I hope we can get a few more creed films if this succeeds, like I think it will."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-14,How good is this?! A good example of how to continue a franchise without devaluing the original movies but also bringing fresh ideas for the future films üëçüèª
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-02-14,This has the potential to be a great movie. I hope it lives up to the hype!!!!!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,It&#39;s crazy how this feels like creed 3 and yet doesn&#39;t. This feels so raw and I love that Adonis isn&#39;t going to spend the entire time just fighting children/disciples of Rocky and Apollo&#39;s rivals. I can&#39;t wait to see this.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-12-06,"‚ÄúI need you to let go of your fear , let go of the guilt , let go of whatever was , and walk into what is‚Äú    POWERFUL"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-30,"Saw this yesterday, best Creed film. Jordan‚Äôs direction is exciting and incredibly creative, influenced by his massive love of anime. If you haven‚Äôt seen it in the cinema, catch it!"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,I could always go for more Jonathan Majors in my life. That dude is on the fast track for an Oscar.
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-24,"Jonathan Majors is going to be the next Denzel Washington as an actor. He has similar charisma and acting range. He even reminds me of a young Sidney Poitier in the trailers for his new movie Devotion. I‚Äôve also read about his director of Ant Man 3 comparing him to a young Marlon Brando, saying he has a very similar energy and range as an actor. Very high praise"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-20,Ain‚Äôt nobody talk about this edit? It‚Äôs absolutely amazing! Whoever created this trailer needs more credit
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-13,"Glad Wood Harris is getting a bigger role in this movie, he‚Äôs always been a phenomenal actor."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"These days, there aren&#39;t too many movie trailers that make me feel. I felt this."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Honestly me missing Rocky went out the window cuz of how much Adonis had grown out of both his fathers and Rocky‚Äôs shadows and introducing his past is the right step into the direction for this story and having his daughter grown up too is great to see cuz maybe she‚Äôll get her story sometime soon
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-11-18,Jonathan Majors giving Zod in Man of steel or Tom Hardy in Warrior vibes as the villain with nothing to lose but everything to gain is the gonna be so interesting to watch. He really is killing it right now
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2023-03-04,Movie was great! I saw it on Thursday! I‚Äôd love to go back and watch it again üòÜ
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"I started rolling my eyes when I saw that they made a third one. I thought, just let it end already. But now that I‚Äôve seen the trailer I changed my mind. I want to see this."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,Love how grounded this feels. Majors is a force with his acting but Jfc he look scary
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-19,"I feel like they took inspiration from Iron Mike when creating Johnath Major&#39;s character, from the way he&#39;s aggressive, to his built, his haircut and the prison element of the story. Gonna be an absolute blast for sure"
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"This looks like it&#39;s going to be amazing. I&#39;m glad that the story is being taken in a different direction, with Adonis doing his own thing independent of Rocky and being out of his shadow. He&#39;s not in this trailer, but Florian Munteanu is supposed to reprise the character of Viktor Drago from Creed 2. I suspect he&#39;s going to help Adonis train to some extent."
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,&quot;There&#39;s no enemy like the past&quot;...I LOVE THAT STATEMENT!!
Creed III,AHmCH7iB_IM,2022-10-18,"When I saw the trailer for Creed 1, that‚Äôs when I started to work out and started to be discipline and consistent and get into the best shape of my life. Every time I see a new movie for Creed, it reminds me that we‚Äôre all have a legacy to leave behind and how far we came. I hope all you guys are giving it your all in life üî•üôè"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,It feels like an explosion of color in every shot
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-30,Loving the animation so far. The only downside I can see in this is that it looks a ‚Äúforbidden relationship‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù type of story. And from what I‚Äôve heard a decent amount of people online are kinda tired of those type of stories. Fortunately for me I don‚Äôt care about story tropes being overdone. What matters for me is if it‚Äôs executed well or not. Hope the movie executes it well.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-30,"Don&#39;t get me wrong here: I love the artstyle and the choice of colour in every shot so far.<br>But the story man... we&#39;ve seen the typical &quot;I have to step into the footsteps of my parents but I never wanted to or didn&#39;t realize I didn&#39;t&quot; for like... the 50th time now. I wish big companies would not only create unqiue worlds and artstyles, but also spice up the story game a little more"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-09-21,This is probably the best Pixar movie I&#39;ve ever seen. At 35 years of age I don&#39;t think a Disney/Pixar movie has ever managed to make me laugh and cry every single watch through like this has.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,Now imagine if Pixar keep doing more originals than sequels. This looks great
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,This is the kind of quality I expect from Disney and Pixar to make. I&#39;m glad to finally get a movie that goes back to being imaginative with its characters and its world building. I definitely look forward to seeing Ember and Wade in the big screen come release day.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"Every time there&#39;s a new movie trailer from Pixar, my inner child will come out and be leaping for joy. Every single time! Oh, it&#39;s so good to feel like a child again."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-09-03,It is beautiful. Best Pixar movie in recent years. <br><br>More than just a cliche love story it‚Äôs actually really deep. Tackling the struggles of an immigrant family. its no wonder its performing well overseas.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be together, you are different!‚Äù is obviously the message they are wishing to tear down in this movie. Looks very visually striking."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-08,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm 100% sold on the story, but the animation and the creative ways these characters interact with the world will still be worth it for sure"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"This legitimately looks really cool! Pixar has not lost its touch when it comes to the visuals and animation, and they‚Äôre showing no signs of losing it anytime soon."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-07-11,"Absolutely LOVED this movie that is full of layers of storytelling, creativity, relationship lessons, and a reminder that we are all humans learning one step at a time. Plus the humor and amazingly beautiful world. Thank you, Pixar!"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-09,"I can&#39;t wait for these two characters to fall in love and then break up due to the pressure of their families towards the middle of the second act only to find out that they don&#39;t care about what others think by the beginning of the third act and then lecture the whole city about the wonders of loving each other&#39;s differences, thus, leading the plot to a climax where everyone learns how much richer their society can be if they mix with each other."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"I might not care much for the story, but this is probably one of <b>if</b> not, the most visually pleasing and beautiful movies that Pixar has made which makes it all the more worth to watch it."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,Please dont let this be bad. All I want is a good movie from Pixar. The visuals look so amazing.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-07-28,"Watched the movie recently, it was a very warm hearted movie. It hit home and made me very emotional, especially because my family and I are immigrants to America and there were strong themes of immigration, belonging, and family business."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,"I don‚Äôt know if this is going to be good or not, but I just love how each of the element people move. -The vibrations, jiggles, and bubbles in the water people -The cloud streaks left behind by the air people -The shifting of the leaves and grass on the earth people -The way the flames wave with the motion of the fire people I think this movie has some good potential. I just hope that its as good as it looks.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANo9JTH54Kc"">https://youtu.be/ANo9JTH54Kc</a>"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"Pixar never fails to impress me with their originality. And as part of Disney&#39;s 100th anniversary celebrations, I still cannot wait to see the film."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-01,"I&#39;m not entirely sure about the story and characters yet, but the animation looks INCREDIBLE and even if it does suck it&#39;ll still be worth seeing to see how far animation has come<br><br>Edit: WHY SO MANY LIKES this is crazy"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-06-29,"The movie surpasses the expectations set by its trailer, defying premature judgments. I&#39;m genuinely delighted that I gave it a chance, as it has become my favorite movie of the year"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-04,"The thing that I&#39;m most excited about is the fact that all of the elements interact really well in their world, like water always wanting to be near, well, water. Fire changing color by touching the crystals is also amazing!"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"I don‚Äôt know if this is going to be good or not, but I just love how each of the element people move.<br><br>-The vibrations, jiggles, and bubbles in the water people<br>-The cloud streaks left behind by the air people<br>-The shifting of the leaves and grass on the earth people<br>-The way the flames wave with the motion of the fire people<br><br>I think this movie has some good potential. I just hope that its as good as it looks."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,i&#39;m not big on how the characters look but i LOVE the imaginative world building. a grill as a baby carriage? thats genius!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-07-01,"I went to see this with my daughter, parents and grandma and knew nothing about the movie and I was floored with how good it was. We were all laughing and crying. I am going again because I loved it that much üòÇ"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-02,Love how different elemental characters have their own homes and the style is magnificent.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"what would instantly make this even more original would be if they dont end up as a romantic pairing in the end, they just stay friends. Platonic stories can be beautiful and emotional too!"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,There‚Äôs a lot of creativity and world building within this film. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this movie
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-07-17,"Loved the movie, I went to an inclusive room with kids and teenagers with autism and the way everyone in the room could experiencie every moment of the movie was amazing. Im going to watch it again in the cinema. Disney and Pixar do it again, continue amazing me for life please."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,Disney and Pixar need this to be a hit. I hope it&#39;s good.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,It&#39;s insane that Pixar can take a simple concept and make it look THIS beautiful!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-09-23,This movie really hit home for me. I‚Äôm Iranian and my family and I were new immigrants to Canada 26 years ago and adjusting to a new country was really difficult. My parents really struggled to find work (they did eventually find good jobs. My mom was a teacher at a daycare and my dad was a mechanical engineer). I really didn‚Äôt understand the extent of it since I was so young (I was 8 and my brother was 4). I‚Äôm 34 now and imagining how difficult it must have been for my parents and how they sacrificed everything for us to have a better life here. This movie really touched me. I‚Äôm crying just writing this. Thank you Pixar for making a movie dedicated to immigrants and how hard life is for them in new country. My parents are still alive and well to this day and I never go a day without telling them how much I love and appreciate what they‚Äôve done for me and my little brother.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,Pixar has almost always been hit
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-22,I like how we all perfectly predicted the plot üò≠
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"Now this is why I love Pixar so much and it‚Äôs because not only are they the Kings of animation but they can develop creative story‚Äôs of anything weather it‚Äôs humans, toys, cars, emotions, animals, elements, or anything and they‚Äôre all fantastic"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-07-02,"I love this movie so much everything they did with the characters, playing with the capabilities and the physics of the different elements and how this affects how elements interact with one another its all so creatively executed. Wade and ember‚Äôs relationship development is also so sweet to follow along and the ‚Äúi love you despite all‚Äù type of love will always be a soft spot for me. Ill fight anyone who says its ‚Äúmid‚Äù or its a flop"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"I absolutely LOVE the animation here. It‚Äôs super gorgeous! Every character has an unique art style and the world looks so colorful, expressive and vibrant. The story looks cute too. I can‚Äôt wait to see this one in theaters. Pixar and Dreamworks are the kings of 3D animation."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,I absolutely love the lesson of befriending others that don‚Äôt look or live like you and getting along. This is going to be such a great message!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-30,"The character designs look so beautiful and unique! Also glad to see more fire people, I thought is was going to be a &quot;last of her kind&quot; story."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-10-20,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!! Every single scene, the story, the colors, the music, ALL the characters ... I cried like a baby so many times and loved every single minute of it. This is going to be my comfort watch for years to come, I know."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,Never doubted Pixar in my life. And this looks fabulous!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-05-16,"The movie looks absolutely stunning and I have little doubt it will visually be an incredible movie. But i feel like I&#39;ve seen this plot already 10,000 times."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,"This actually looks a lot better than I expected. The way they animated the character Ember feels sort of 2D?? (especially how they animate her face throughout the trailer and at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a>). I&#39;m surprised that Wade is the character that convinces Ember to explore outside of her comfort zone and not the other way around, which is really cool. The plot doesn&#39;t feel super original, but I&#39;m kind of excited for this movie now!"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2024-02-23,"This movie is one of the best I have seen. Something new and refreshing! And gave me a good gentle cry too! A kind of comforting feel to it too, with great graphics and designs. Will be a treat to watch back üòä"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,The animations on this are truly spectacular. Very well done Pixar work. Can‚Äôt wait to see this when it comes out!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-04-03,"I liked the third act where the water man says, ‚ÄúI like the word moist, okay? It‚Äôs who I am, and if you can‚Äôt accept that, then what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù<br><br>Best part of this movie of all time."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-31,"WOW I‚Äôm surprised more people aren‚Äôt disappointed. From the trailer I can tell the whole plot. What ever happened to heart wrenching, unique, and innovative Pixar. All of their beats have unique stories with unique messages and characters. This looks like ever love story to exist but colorful. Looks visually pretty but emotionally dry"
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2024-11-17,"People can say its an overdone plot, but I think they did everything perfectly. It covers a lot of real points that hit really hard, and is overall an amazing movie. Give it a watch, it&#39;ll probably surprise you. One of my favorite Pixar/Disney movies. FYI, the director did The Good Dinosaur, and he delivers in this one too."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,I can&#39;t wait to tear up in the cinema watching this as Pixar films always have that scene that crushes my heart in the best possible way
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,Characters designs are incredible.<br>An excellent fusion on 3D and 3D gives elementals are &quot;drawn&quot; appearance and yet they also have a solid build.<br>I am going to enjoy this movie.<br>Pixar is getting better with every year.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,This looks WAY better than the teaser trailer! It looks way more creative and interesting than I first thought!
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-08-15,"The trailer doesn‚Äôt do the movie justice. It‚Äôs so adorable and sweet, sad. It‚Äôs a beautiful movie."
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-29,This movie was made for me. I‚Äôve always loved opposites attract romances. And this is literally fire and water. Amazing.
Elemental,hXzcyx9V0xw,2023-03-28,"The animation is sooo bright and fluid! Glad to see more of the fire elements.<br>Maybe the ideas of elemental people and &quot;you can be out of your element&quot; seem generic, but even clich√©s can be written in a clever and breathtaking way.

Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"The way we went from all the games, and with a movie that has been in development for 8 years is actually insane. We got to watch this franchise grow into this huge fandom."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-29,Spoiler alert: those animatronics might get a little quirky at night
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,Even after 8 years FNAF is still bigger than ever! It&#39;s amazing to see what this franchise has achieved!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-12-06,Loved the part where josh hutcherson started whistling and all the animatronics got sturdy on the floor.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,FINALLY !! AFTER 8 YEARS. It‚Äôs here !!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"The fact that I stumbeled upon Markipliers first Fnaf video all the way back in 2014, and now several years and games later It‚Äôs finally getting a movie, absolutely insane. Cory being apart of it too is wild and I honestly can‚Äôt wait. What an absolute wild ride this has been so far."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"FNAF Help Wanted 2, FNAF Security Breach Ruin DLC, and this movie. What a great year for FNAF fans"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-01-04,"This guy lost his best friend when he was a kid, then he went to the center of the earth, survived hunger games, now taking a job at freddy&#39;s. He knows no peace in life."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"How cool to see Cory participating in this movie, he deserves a lot, I can&#39;t believe the fnaf movie is actually happening, I still remember Markplier&#39;s videos, animations, The Living Tombstone songs and the fear of playing the games, It&#39;s so nice to know that only one guy named Scott Cawthon has managed to do all of this since 2014.. Thank You Scott and Blumhouse for this gift"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Cory being a main part of the trailer at the end is so heartwarming. Legit the most real and chill person, he&#39;s helped me through so many tough days. So glad to see him cameo"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-03,I have an art teacher who once worked with Scott Cawthon before he made FNAF. Scott was gonna venture into other careers and then brought this gem of a franchise to life. Hope this film delivers well upon his legacy!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-03,WHO&#39;S HERE AFTER THE SECOND MOVIE TRAILER CAME OUT?!? üëÄüëÄ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Glad to see Cory getting recognition he deserves, its great how he went from playing &amp; loving Scott&#39;s games to being a part of FNAF movie"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-13,"it&#39;s insane to see how a small little game in 2014 went to being an actual movie, from a franchise to a fandom. It&#39;s been a wonderful experience"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-08-08,THERES NO WAY THIS IS ALREADY A YEAR OLD WTF
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,I love Cory so seeing him in this movie is truly amazing. He‚Äôs come so far from playing fnaf in his parents house to actually being in the movie. Props to you Cory üëèüéâ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,I remember sitting down to watch Markiplier‚Äôs first FNAF video when it came out. Then rushing and buying the mobile version on my phone so I could play too. Now we‚Äôre all the way to a full blown movie. What an amazing franchise to be a part of.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,I watched Cory since 2016 when he had less than a million subscribers and every video i watched made me smile. Now it‚Äôs 2023 he has over 16 million subscribers and now is featured in a movie and I can not show how much I am so proud of him of how much he grew. He truly is the shogun!!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-02-17,i remember going to the theater on release day with my friend to watch it. i can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been a year since the movie was released and it literally felt like yesterday.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-08-27,"Honestly i dont care if this is good or bad, the fact this community gone this far is incredible"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,I hope the community takes this well.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,I screamed so loud when Cory appeared. So glad he‚Äôs getting the recognition he deserves. Such a great cameo.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-08-08,ScottGames... what are u PLANNING?
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"I‚Äôm so happy to see Cory in this. Thanks to FNAF his career became what is it now. He‚Äôs touched so many people and inspired millions and then some. It‚Äôs amazing to see the community giving Cory a well deserved place in the film.<br><br><b>UPDATE</b><br>A lot of people have been arguing about wether Cory really deserved the role. Some say it should be markiplier, which I totally understand, considering Cory isn‚Äôt the only one to stream FNAF and make the fan base what it is now, however, we must understand that this is a very subjective opinion that varies from person to person, so we shouldn‚Äôt bother finding the right answer, because there isn‚Äôt one. No matter who truly deserved it, the movie will still be a banger and I can‚Äôt wait to see it!!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-01,"I hope it‚Äôs not too cheesy. The fnaf games were honestly really scary, and the plot behind it was really interesting and in depth. I always said the fnaf games had a lot of potential on the big screen if done right, just hope it delivers"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Finally!! One of the biggest dreams of FNAF fans, is here!! I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s going to be good or bad, we have a movie about the game. Thanks for that Scott and Blumhouse, it&#39;s amazing."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-10-27,Can&#39;t believe its already been a year. Felt like just yesterday we were all sitting in the theater watching what all of us waited 9 years for. Happy birthday fnaf movie ü•≥
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-01,It‚Äôs truly amazing to see how far 5 nights at Freddy‚Äôs has come and how it went from a viral 2014 horror game to a franchise worth over $70 million
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Seeing Cory at the end of trailer genuinely made me smile, it just amazes me to see him on the big screen in a movie about a game series that he‚Äôs loved since the beginning"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-29,The fact that Blumhouse brought in Scott Cawthon to write the story and help with the screenplay is a MAJOR W. So many movies with lots of potential have been ruined by directors and writers who don&#39;t know anything about the source material. This doesn&#39;t seem to be one of those instances at all. So excited to see this on the big screen!!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-06-26,"You know, when this was announced, I actually thought Blumhouse would pick up some old Chuck E. Cheese animatronics and refurbish those into Freddy and the gang"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,The theme song sends chills down my back. Great work everyone who worked hard to get this movie to actually happening for the past 8 years!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-30,"I love how fnaf is definitely NOT a game for children, but those kids are now adults and can go see a movie which will probably not be for kids either. I love it"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-03-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VH9WCFV6XQ&amp;t=119"">1:59</a> this is the part that made hardcore fnaf fans scream of excitement"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-30,"As a Cory fan, him getting a cameo in a movie based off of a game that made his YT career after all these years is nice to see, even if its a small role, he was damn excited for it."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,Never thought I&#39;d live to see the day a movie happens. So many of us have been with this community from day 1 of the first game. The actors look and sound amazing and the sets are perfect. Looking forward to dressing up for the launch date and really taking this in! Congratulations Scott!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,The fact they included Corey as a cameo for the movie makes this many times better to the point that many of us will want to see the movie even more at this point
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-03,"Hold up, this ain‚Äôt the Chuck E‚Äô Cheese place"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-21,the fact that the animatronics very accurately depict the ones from the original game gives me hope that this movie is going to be good.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"It&#39;s amazing how far Scott and the franchise has come. In less than a decade, a movie was born from such a simple yet terrifying indie game, and you can really tell how much love went into this. They have come so far and deserve it all. I&#39;m so happy that Scott even gave a little bit of credit to the youtubers that always played all the amazing games he made."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,I‚Äôm so proud of you Cory . I‚Äôm so happy for him !! He deserves the world ‚ù§
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-09-09,"After watching the Minecraft movie trailer, I realized that with the right people directing the movie, they will do it from a game the BEST way possible"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-09,I hope Scott makes a voice message for the guard just like in the games. I have a feeling that this is going to be an outstanding video game adaptation!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"I remember a &#39;few&#39; years ago when there were rumours about a film, but to actually see a trailer is a whole different experience - crazy how far this franchise has come."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,Proud of Cory and how far he&#39;s come in his career. Went from playing FNAF to being in one for real.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-01-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VH9WCFV6XQ&amp;t=81"">1:21</a> I love the redo of Freddy‚Äôs music box"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"We‚Äôre proud of you, Scott, for making a beast of an indie series. Thanks for all you‚Äôve done, and here‚Äôs hoping the movie is a smash hit."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Not the biggest FNAF fan, but I‚Äôm definitely amazed with how far this franchise has come, from a indie game on steam to a full blown movie"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"It‚Äôs amazing seeing Cory get recognized he deserves it, it‚Äôs mind blowing watching him play every single masterpiece Scott which he‚Äôs a genius by the way. Every game he‚Äôs created to watching him be in the first official movie and from the looks of it this movie isn‚Äôt gonna disappoint."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-01-14,¬´¬† why do i always get the weirdos?!¬†¬ª forever remembering thatüòÇ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"Even though FNAF‚Äôs lore can be complicated, let‚Äôs all agree that Cory‚Äôs cameo could actually be one of the biggest plot points the lore has ever given us and actually makes sense."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"seeing cory this made me really shed a tear... he&#39;s came so far and worked so hard, i cant stomach how proud i am for him"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-06,"it‚Äôs so surreal being a fan of this little indie game back in 2014, to watch it develop and eventually become a full blown movie"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-12-02,"I can‚Äôt even imagine what Scott went through/is going through. Going from a developer who made really obscure games that couldn‚Äôt turn profits, getting heavily criticised while working at dollar general to his lightning in a bottle game becoming so massive that it becomes a full feature length film making more money then any other blumhouse movie or any other horror movie in 2023, a massive community who cherishes what he makes and spawning an entire genre of new horror games that became their own franchises to make new communities and creations must be insane."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-09,It&#39;s incredible how they made the animatronics almost precisely on point to the game! Seriously mad respect for those who put so much time and effort into making the animatronics!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-29,"It feels bittersweet seeing this, perhaps knowing this is Scott&#39;s last big project with the franchise, but no matter what I&#39;ll still be apart of this community no matter how crappy it gets, I WILL respect Scott, he has done so many things in the lives of others thanks to this franchize. thank you Scott, thank you, SteelWool, thank you cast, and thank you Universal/blumhouse for letting the biggest game of our lives become a movie. I didnt think this would become a movie and yet im so happy it did.<br><br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: I think you guys misunderstood what i said with his last projects, I said its gonna be his last BIG project and i know he&#39;s gonna be working behind the scenes, it means that he wont be the one giving updates and interacting with the community anymore"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"It‚Äôs great seeing Cory getting the recognition he deserves, getting a cameo in the official fnaf movie is insane"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-03-16,its hard to believe this movie came out a YEAR ago
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"Congrats to Scott Cawthon and CoryxKenshin bro. They‚Äôve come so far it‚Äôs baffling. It‚Äôs so crazy to see how some random game developer and some small YouTube content creator from 2014 have both made greatness and have risen eachother to fame. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Cory and a huge fan of the fnaf franchise. It nearly brings a tear to my eye knowing that I used to watch Cory when I was young and watch gameplays of this game as a young kid. Now I‚Äôm a teen and I got to whiteness how far they‚Äôve come. Once again, congrats to Cory and Scott for making this movie even possible. Much love to both of them ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-08-14,"I was a 10 year old kid when FNAF was first released and I loved it. The first time a horror game interested me as a young kid. I remember the times with my older brother and younger me watching youtubers playing the game on youtube and how my classmates/friends would talk about FNAF in elementary school 4th grade back then. I am now 19 years old and will definitely watch the upcoming movie itself. And honestly, I just find it &quot;awesome&quot; to know and see kids of today&#39;s generation getting into Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, just as we older people did as kids back then.<br><br>Edit: What the heck&#39;s going on in the comment section here?<br><br>..... Oh well, it&#39;s the internet anyways."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-02-28,8 months already?!<br>Time ain&#39;t real
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-30,Can we just appreciate how good the animatronics look so similar to the actual game?
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"I&#39;m not a big Fnaf fan, but I hope this does well to keep building momentum for better video game movie adaptations in the future."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"One of the first things I watched after I created my youtube account in 2015 was Markiplier‚Äôs FNAF series. 9 year old me was quickly obsessed, and 8 years later, it‚Äôs incredible to see how far the fanbase and franchise has gone. The first fandom I was truly apart of! My friends and I knew EVERYTHING about the lore‚Ä¶.."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-02,Who‚Äôs here watching this before the FNAF 2 trailer????
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-09,"Could you imagine a world, where fnaf never blew up? A world where the community dropped the story and it faded to obscurity?<br>Its amazing to see so much come from something that was so small.<br>And I think the best part is that OG fans really feel like we made this happen. We kept this series alive and now it&#39;s going to go on to do great things.<br>Its almost like raising a child <br>A horrifying, murderous child."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"The way I smiled through this entire trailer,I‚Äôm so excited. I‚Äôm so proud of you Scott and thank you for making mine and a bunch of other peoples childhoods worth it! I can‚Äôt wait to go see it!! Dang, can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 8 yrs"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"Scott and Blumhouse, just by including people from the FNAF community, a massive round of applause to you. You understand and appreciate the people that made this movie happen. Regardless of good or not, this movie scored major points just through that."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-03,People who are here after seeing the second five nights at Freddy‚Äôs movie trailer
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,The fact that this started as an indie game is amazing by itself. This really looks like the game brought to life.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"My heart SUNK when I saw Cory, I‚Äôm so proud of him!! He‚Äôs come so far. We love you Cory‚ô°"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"The music fits perfectly with the movie trailer. It gives you chills when you see the abandoned place and a old VHS tape plays. When the lady was speaking, you could see how this place has been torn down but the animatronics still look pretty new."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-03-24,"It‚Äôs already been two years.<br><br><br>Damm, time really does fly."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"I remember growing up with this franchise, being addicted to the lore. Happy to see that it got a movie. Even if the movie turns out mediocre, still pretty crazy to know this all started as a simple indie game.<br><br>Congrats Scott!!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"I hope the community takes this well. I personally think it looks FANTASTIC!! As a die hard FNAF fan I‚Äôm okay with the story changing slightly for a movie adaptation. Let it be it‚Äôs own thing. Between the games, books, and now A MOVIE (finally!!) Five nights at Freddy‚Äôs tells a chilling story with not every question having an answer‚Äîwhich I think is exactly what Scott wanted to do in the first place with it. And that‚Äôs exactly why people have been coming back to it years later. Congrats to Scott and BlumHouse and the team for finally fulfilling our dreams of seeing our favorite animatronics on the big screen!!!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-29,FINALLY LET&#39;S GOOO!!! THE SEQUEL TO THE HUNGER GAMES!!! PEETA MELARCKY!!!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-03-10,"its meen monthss, and i STILL cannot believe this movie was not only a thing that happened, but it was good"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-30,This looks really interesting! Here&#39;s hoping the movie will be just as good as the games! üòÉ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,It‚Äôs so nice to see how far Cory has come from playing fnaf in 2014 to actually being in the movie for it it‚Äôs insane üëèüèæ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-03-30,"Security breach movie would be amazing. Main plot: Gregory&#39;s parents leave without him, he stays six hours. It would be the Burntrap ending. He would struggle to run away from animatronics so he would try and shatter them. Maybe 3 movies? 1 movie for every 2 hours. Maybe ruin DLC could be sequel."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,Seeing Cory made me start to tear a little bit because he absolutely deserves to be in this movie and Scott having him be in it is just awesome
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-11-15,Love how they have casted Mathew Lillard. It&#39;s like a homage to his affiliation with horror based movies back in the day.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,Words alone cannot describe how excited I am for this movie. Huge congratulations to Scott and Cory!
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2024-07-06,"It&#39;s so amazing coming back to this trailer after so many months. I have been a diehard FNAF fan since the day the first game came out. I watched every Markiplier video, every Matpat theory, and accumulated thousands of hours in gameplay through continuously beating every game, then doing it once more. Seeing how such a tiny game turned into a large, robust series, with an alignment of toys and such a massive community really helps in sealing Five Nights at Freddys as the greatest horror-videogame series out there. Massive congratulations to Scott Cawthon, the man who created our childhoods!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"I love how they changed the eyes, the more subtle yellow eyes and red pupils looks so much better. The all red was just so bright and distracting but the yellow makes them look like they‚Äôre almost sick or something, I LOVE IT."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,to be honest I don&#39;t care if its bad I just wanna finally see the movie come out and watch it. Its been 8 years since the movie was announced and after many set backs we finally have a confirmed date and everything seems to be ready and the trailer and teaser are absolutely amazing.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-29,"There&#39;s one thing some people missed. Golden Freddy&#39;s eyes normally indicate the 2 spirits in the animatronic in the games. Here in the trailer, we see that one of Golden Freddy&#39;s eyes is missing. Which might indicate that 1 of the souls in Golden Freddy is missing. We also know that the Crying Child is more friendly compared to Cassidy. Cassidy in UCN is torturing William forever, while the Crying Child lets go, and leaves the animatronic. Which probably means Cassidy is missing, and the one blue eye is the Crying Child. Which could be the reason Golden Freddy is not after Abby."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-09,This brings back nostalgia even though it has been around a year I remember watching this multiple times loving it and get jumpscared by FRICKIN balloon Boy
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"It&#39;s actually INSANE that this movie is almost here. I remember watching Markiplier&#39;s original FNAF videos on my 3DS back in 2014. I was in 5th grade then, now I am beginning my second year of college. THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!!!!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-05,I cannot believe that I was around to witness this amazing game grow into a fandom that then went on to receive its own movie! Very grateful for Scott to create such a wonderful masterpiece xx
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"&quot;When the night shift starts, the nightmare begins&quot;<br>The perfect phrase to describe this franchise<br>Let&#39;s go for the 10 years!<br>And let&#39;s make this movie a hit!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-04-03,"ü´µCaught you coming here after watching the fnaf movie 2 teaser trailer, didn‚Äôt I? üêª"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,"From an indie game developer to a FNAF creator, it goes to show that his dedication to the franchise is still intact."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,Its so amazing what this franchise has accomplished over its 8 years. I remember it first coming out and being so excited. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s DEFINITELY holds a big place in my heart.
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,And to think this franchise started with a man who took negative reviews over how scary his game is and turned it around and made it into this masterpiece and 8 years later it‚Äôs a movie. Hats off to you Scott Cawthon! üòâ
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-12-06,"I remember being so excited when I first saw this trailer right after it came out, I&#39;m so happy that the movie is finally here after 8 years! It&#39;s a complete masterpiece and I absolutely like how popular and successful it got, truly deserves it! üòÑ"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-27,I am so happy and proud for Cory that he got to be in an actual movie. He has come so far and seeing him in this trailer makes me so happy. Not just that but the movie looks fire üî•
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-06-28,"I remember this just being another horror game that a bunch of YouTubers were crazy about back in 2014 (for a good reason). I was just a kid then, and watching Markiplier&#39;s playthrough of the first game and all the others to come after was incredible and nostalgic, to say the least.<br><br>Rewatching his playthroughs was fun (especially during quarantine lol) and seeing him revisit the games and play a bunch of fangames, like other YouTubers, really showed that this wasn&#39;t just some cool horror game that inspired and was loved by a huge fanbase, but was a journey for all of us (cheesy, I know).<br><br>The Fazbear Fanverse was‚Äîand still is‚Äîpretty frickin&#39; awesome, and I can&#39;t wait for the projects being created. And, speaking of the fangames, TJoC, Popgoes, FNaC, and a bunch of other iconic fan creations were an amazing part of FNaF, and really made more of the franchise. Especially the cringey and funny (but memorable) FNaF animations that came of it, and those who even made their own FNaF movie lol.<br><br>The fact that this started out as just another horror game with such a simple premise on the market into a pretty high-quality, impressively low-budget horror movie from Blumhouse is . . . well, amazing! I can&#39;t stress enough how impressive and incredible this journey through FNaF has become.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for the movie, and I&#39;m definitely going to theaters to see this. See you all there!"
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2023-07-07,"In most movies, when someone would report someone being possessed or if there is a killing robot in the streets, officers would laugh it off and ignore it, but the fact that in this movie, an officer literally informes Mike that there are kids possessing the animatronics and her telling him that they want to make Abby like the animatronics is kind of cool."
Five Nights at Freddy's,0VH9WCFV6XQ,2025-01-24,"I&#39;ve been following the franchise since 2015, along with my friends, it was exciting to be with them to watch this film from this franchise that we grew up following together."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"i&#39;m a simple man, i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming, i put this on the must watch list."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-13,"When I was a child the original Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite movie. I would watch it every day multiple times a day and make my whole family watch with me. Most of my family got tired of me asking them to rewatch it for the 100th time but my grandma never did. She always watched it with me, sung the songs, and rehearsed the lines with me. she never got tired of it. Earlier this year she passed away and I wish I could see this with her but when it comes out I will go see it in honor of her with a empty seat next to me just for her.<br><br>Edit: I didn‚Äôt mean the one with Johnny Depp I meant the original movie with Gene Wilder just forgot it was named Willy wonka and the chocolate factory instead of Charlie and the chocolate factory."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-02-21,"&quot;Every good thing in this world started with a dream, so you hold on to yours.&quot; This really touched me."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-14,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get to see an third installment of Wonka in my lifetime. I‚Äôm 72 years old and I will be watching this film at the theaters!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-14,"Every character I&#39;ve seen Timoth√©e Chalamet play is usually soft-spoken and reserved ... so it&#39;s kind of odd to see him in an energetic role like this. At the end of the day, though? It looks like a cute, lighthearted, family-friendly flick that people&#39;ll take their kids to during the holidays. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it ended up doing really well..."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-04-11,I didn&#39;t know Paul Atreides made chocolate
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-14,Honestly it&#39;s nice to see a heartwarming movie coming to theaters for a change. I feel like the cast and crew had a lot of fun with Wonka
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"&quot;From the Director of Paddington&quot; I&#39;m sold, those movies are cinematic masterpieces"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-03-31,Was expecting a Johnny Depp take on Willy Wonka but Chalamet nailed it. I know people thinking he&#39;s overrated but what an actor!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"The simple fact that this is directed by the guy who did the two Paddington movies is enough to get me to watch this. Those films were absolute masterpieces of performances, storytelling and direction."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Even if it&#39;s minor role, it&#39;s always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can&#39;t wait to see this one, the film captures the spirit of the source material so well ‚ù§"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-03-22,My favorite part is when Wonka added a little too much spice and started dreaming about leading a group of desert folks to paradise üëç
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Okay, good to know this is a film that knows it is goofy and silly, but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun. Not to mention the cast looks incredible, and the director has never actually made a bad film, so I got a good feeling about this one."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Directed and written by the man who made paddington? It&#39;s gonna be a masterpiece.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-24,I love how this is 100% a Christmas movie without being about actual Christmas. The outfits and whole aesthetic. Christmas was definitely the vibe they where going for!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-03-01,My favorite scene in this movie is when Willy fights &quot;The Unknown&quot; and sucks him into a vacuum.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-20,"Love the ending, when he says &quot;the true wonka were the friends we made along the way&quot;"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-01-24,"I cried at the end, not because of a happy ending, but because I&#39;ve been watching Willy Wonka movie about aa hundred times and this sequel reminded me of my childhood"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Something I never thought I wanna see: a Willy Wonka prequel!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-16,"I love how they harmonized (reprised) the ‚Äúin the world of pure imagination‚Äù in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=90"">1:30</a>"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2025-03-29,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a trailer that has put a giddy smile on my face.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then there&#39;s no stopping him.<br>You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,This looks like a real festive movie. We&#39;ve not had one of those in years.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-07-24,"Wonka was absolutely phenomenal! The story, music, songs, cinematography, beautiful colorful sets, everything was top notch. Perfectly captured the magic of the Roald Dahl books.  Timoth√©e Chalamet stole the show as Willy Wonka. One of the best feel good movies I have seen in a long time. üç´üëèüëèüëè"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-25,"I loved it when he said &quot;It&#39;s Wonking Time&quot; and Wonked all over the screen, one of the movie moments of all time."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"This movie looks absolutely magical, I never knew I needed a willy wonka prequel but this looks like it‚Äôs gonna be a wonderful watch. can‚Äôt wait!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-08-16,"On the one hand, it looks whimsical and lovely for a Christmas movie. On the other, and I might be the cheese that stands alone, I feel like Chalamet is not weird enough for the role - his lines fall flat to me. I love Chalamet so hoping the movie will change my mind. I&#39;ll watch if only for Grant as a oompa loompa, what genius casting!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-04-01,"This was a great movie, I loved Huge Grant as the Oompa Loompa, Roland Atkinson as the clergyman was an unexpected surprise, and Timothee Chalamet (even though I never heard of him) did a fantastic job as Willy Wonka, he really made the character his own. <br><br>A very cool origin story<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed it, great visuals, acting, story, and soundtrack. You really got a visceral example of capitalism, greed, corruption, redemption, and justice. <br><br>This stands alongside the 1971 original well."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary. But I gotta admit, this looks quite good. And Timothee is very talented!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"I love how Timothee Chalamet is paying homage to both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder when it comes to his take on Willy Wonka. So excited to see his full version of wonka, based on what I see in this trailer, he already is amazing!!!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Willy Wonka is actually selling his weird stuff and not just his chocolate bars. Respect to WB for going in a new direction rather than just the &quot;I need a replacement for my chocolate factory&quot; also I enjoyed the Harry Potter vibe from the setting, Wonka may not have been magical but his candy sure seems to be."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-04-03,"Whoever knows Timoth√®e Chalamet, raise your hand because I do"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"As fascinating as this movie looks, I&#39;m kinda sad that we&#39;ll likely never get a &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot; movie. I remember reading that book in school immediately after finishing &quot;the Chocolate Factory&quot; and had always wondered how it could be as a movie"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-10-14,Only thing weird is how they took this in a more magical direction. Even adult Wonka hadn&#39;t perfected Fizzy lifting drink and all of his inventions had strange side effects. This younger Wonka seems too perfect.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-13,‚ÄúDiscover how Willy became Wonka‚Äù is my new favorite line now.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-02-22,Honestly this is a good movie even when others seem to dislike it. It‚Äôs cute and it explains the way he is in the original and why he acts the way he does towards Charlie
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-21,Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over. Thank you Roald Dahl.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"I was always wondering how a prequel to willy wonka, describing his origin, would be like. Now, after seeing this, I am fully onboard now. This looks absolutely amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see this in theaters."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"didn‚Äôt really think this was gonna be anything but this has captured the Roald Dahl vibe better than anything else I‚Äôve seen since the original Chocolate Factory, plus its directed by the Paddington guy"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-12-03,Calah Lane carried the movie.  She was brilliant.  Didn‚Äôt realize she was 15.  She was perfect.  So talented.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> Always love an &quot;epic&quot; version of a classic theme tune, even if I&#39;ve only heard it about twice in my life."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"honestly im very much surprised of how amazing this looks. it feels so magical and like such a wholesome movie, and its not a remake!! its a non canon prequel of one of the most magical and mysterious characters of lots of peoples childhoods (and its timothee chalamet, which i adore with all my heart hes so adorable)"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-09-07,I love all these 100% original and not shamelessly rehashed movies being put out these days
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-12-01,"Could you imagine,. Getting up,.. and driving ,..and paying to watch this?,.lol~"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"I&#39;m a fairly cynical person when it comes to reboots etc, but this actually has a really fun, sincere, festive vibe. Seems like it will be a good time"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Yes another Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory movie!! This was my favorite childhood movie.<br><br>Lots of likes!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-06-12,The ending made me so emotional. Realizing why sharing a special moment with someone was so important and having them there in spirit when he accomplished his goals was heart breaking and beautiful. This was like closure to my childhood even if I am an adult now.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-08-12,When he says ‚Äúwith great chocolate comes great responsibility‚Äù gave me chillbumps
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Everyone wait hold on is that from mr bean? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&amp;t=101"">1:41</a>"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"Chalamet‚Äôs take feels a lot like Gene Wilder‚Äôs Wonka before he became jaded, bitter, and worn down. I like it."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2025-04-23,hello i&#39;m now at 2025 i apparently watched this movie
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"Okay, I haven&#39;t seen that many Timothee Chalamet movies, but he seems to smile a lot more here. It&#39;s good to see him expand his acting range. Looking forward to this movie."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Hughmpa Loompa is my new favorite thing
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Man that scene where willy said &quot;It&#39;s wonking time&quot; and chocolated everyone in the room,, cinema right there."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-01-30,"Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Keegan-Micheal Key.<br>Now thats a cast you wouldn‚Äôt wanna miss"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,So happy for you Daniel Thrasher! How cool!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Remember seeing the original as a little kid when it first came out in theaters. Seen it countless times since.  I begrudgingly ended up enjoying Tim Burton&#39;s version, particularly Danny Elfman&#39;s music.  This one also looks promising.  Should do well, I think."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,This shows that Timothee is really growing as an actor. I&#39;m actually proud of him.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-08-13,"Wonka has been by far my favorite movie of all time. The first time I watched this in the theatre, I already knew this movie was gonna be my favorite."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Rowan Atkinson&#39;s appearance alone is enough to let me know that this movie is gonna be great, and of course our boy Timothy will amaze us with his performance‚ú®Ô∏è"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"You know its gonna be good, when just the trailer puts a smile on your face."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,I cant&#39;t wait! The cast is insane! My jaw was on the floor throughout the video. Timothee has an extraordinary career going on.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-01-27,Finally! A movie about the history of diabetes and cancer. This should be educational!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Timothee proves himself once again to be a versatile actor that has so much to offer. <br><br>He‚Äôs not this generation‚Äôs Johnny Deep or Leo. <br><br>He‚Äôs the one and only Timothee Chalamet!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,I love how whimsical it is. Very true to the feel of the original and I have faith in the Director of Paddington to create a masterpiece.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-02-29,"This story is before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film is based on a novel, ‚ÄòCharlie and the Chocolate Factory‚Äô. The movie tells the story about Charlie&#39;s childhood, so we can know why Charlie is obsessed with chocolate.<br>I love the acting, music, and graphic in this film. Timothee Chalamet plays the role of Willy Wonka. My favorite character is Willy Wonka because he is very bright and creative. In addition, music and graphic in this movie was so amazing. I was moved with songs and graphic was definitely beautiful.<br>I think this is a great film for people who like fantasy movie and Timothee Chalamet. It makes Timothee Chalamet more charming. The story is a little bit sad, but positive and exciting.<br>I‚Äôll give Wonka ‚Äòfive stars‚Äô. I want to watch one more!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"The magic, the vibes, the music. It‚Äôs all so wonderful. Def won‚Äôt be skipping this one"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Love the how they use ‚Äúpure imagination‚Äù in this, the inspiration is lovely"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,I loved it when Wonka said &quot;With great chocolate comes great responsibility&quot; truly the most movie moment ever made
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-06-26,"For those that don‚Äôt know the original wonka was Willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the second one was Charlie and the chocolate factory he was given the whole factory by Willy wonka at the end of the first movie cause he passed the test , fast forward to this movie is a complete reboot of the whole series of movies"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-13,Charlie and the chocolate factory + Mr Bean = Perfect combo to re-live my childhood memories üòçüòçüòç
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"The Paddington production team and Chalamet sounds like a recipe for success right here, especially for the latter as Dune, Part 2 is also guaranteed to be a success!"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-08-03,I love the part where Timothee said &quot;it&#39;s wonking time.&quot; Really a movie of many generations and timely accurate depictions.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-01-24,This is one of the few prequel movies that didn&#39;t make me dissapointed
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Timoth√©e Chalamet is a phenomenal actor. I hope they show a devastated and torn side of him to keep the audience from thinking this is only a whimsical story
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"The opportunity to see Timmy dancing and singing already had me sold on the<br> movie, but this makes it look even more amazing than I&#39;d imagined."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,Timothy really has been killing it these past few years
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-01-28,I called my wife an Oompa Loompa she won&#39;t talk to me now
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-13,"‚ÄúSo shines a good deed in a weary world‚Äù - Willy Wonka (1971). They‚Äôre bringing the spirit of the first film back, and I‚Äôm totally on board."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"Honestly I love how endearing and comfortable Timothee is in the role. It&#39;s like he amplifies the &quot;feel-good&quot; and whimsical tones of the film really well. I also like how they showed us that Willy Wonka struggles, without shoving it down our throats. Can&#39;t wait for this"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"Wow this looks amazing! People were talking like it was going to be dark and gritty, instead it&#39;s whimsical, with dance numbers! This trailer totally changed my opinion on this movie. I can&#39;t wait to see it."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2025-01-17,"With &quot;Wonka,&quot; Timoth√©e Chalamet took on an iconic role, that of the young Willy Wonka, bringing back to the big screen the magic and fantasy of the world created by Roald Dahl. A role that allowed him to show a different side of his talent, lighter and more playful, but always with that interpretive depth that distinguishes him. The anticipation for this film was very high, and Chalamet did not disappoint expectations, delivering a memorable performance. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23timoth%C3%A9echalamet"">#Timoth√©eChalamet</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wonka"">#Wonka</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23willywonka"">#WillyWonka</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23roalddahl"">#RoaldDahl</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cinema"">#Cinema</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23film"">#Film</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23magic"">#Magic</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fantasy"">#Fantasy</a>"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,With how fascinating Willy Wonka&#39;s backstory was in the movie I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s taken 50 years to make a movie about it. Very much looking forward to seeing this!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,The fact that two parts of my childhood (Willy Wonka in general and Rowan Atkinson/ Mr. Bean) are in this movie makes me want to watch it so badly

Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,I really miss these types of wholesome movies Hollywood used to make back then so much and I hope the Wonka movie don&#39;t disappoint üòä.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-11-20,My favorite part was when I stayed home and watched the original Willy Wonka movie.
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-14,"I think this actually looks rather fun and I trust the makers of Paddington implicitly to handle this with care and integrity. That being said, this does feed even more into the idea that Hollywood is absolutely bankrupt of original ideas and creativity."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-12-15,I loved everything about this movie. Its so well done. I sat smiling through the closing credits. So good!
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"What a legendary cast! When you see Matthew Baynton from Horrible Histories, you know this movie‚Äôs going to be a classic."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,"I still think Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka but may he rest in peace, I&#39;ll give this movie a chance"
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-12,"You know, I was initially skeptical of this movie when I first heard the premise. But it looks like a lot of fun, and solidly whimsical. Plus, the fact that the director of Paddington directed this movie definitely convinced me to at least check this movie out. Looks like it&#39;d be fun to see in theaters too."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2024-03-09,"This was an excellent theatrical production. I mean that literally. It wasn&#39;t cinematic. It was a theatrical musical. Between story, song, and dance; it was charming, poignant, and cute. I dare to say it will be a classic. I remember hearing it bombed at the box office. No matter. It might take 5 years streaming. It will be so."
Wonka,otNh9bTjXWg,2023-07-11,I love the part when he said it‚Äôs wonking time. Sent chills down my spine

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-01,Their reaction to ‚Äúbecause he kills everyone who does‚Äù is such a teen boy reaction I love it
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,Jackie Chan playing as Splinter is probably the best casting for this movie.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2024-01-18,&quot;You got a rage problem.&quot;<br>&quot;ITS NOT A PROBLEM!&quot;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,I actually love the idea of actually seeing them as Younger Teenagers. Usually they&#39;re obviously around like 16-19 year olds personality wise but these guys feel like they are fresh out of 6th grade.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"Love the idea of Mikey presumably going through puberty before Donnie, it adds a lot of character seeing as Mikey is usually the baby of the group."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"‚ÄúYou ratted us out!‚Äù <br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use that word that way!!‚Äù <br>‚ÄúSorry, dad.‚Äù <br>I love this movie already üò≠"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-08-11,"Before Mikey says, &quot;Sorry, dad,&quot; I hear Leo in the background saying, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s 2023, Mikey&quot;"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-01,I love the fact that the Turtles are voiced by actual Teenagers and act like them as well it&#39;s  such a nice detail
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-01,"I adore the Spider-verse inspired animation esthetic, but instead of going with a comic book style, it looks more like a graffiti, street art texture and design, absolutely perfect for our turtles"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"This movie has such a more grungy aesthetic which really complements the character designs of the turtles, the ferocious mutants, and the humans. And once again, the animation is stellar! The bright pops of color contrasting to the dark gritty background make for some great visuals. The fight scenes look well animated and the hand-drawn effects are done incredibly well. The character designs for each mutant are distorted and grotesque with slight face disfigurements that differ themselves from other iterations. Hearing more of the turtles‚Äô voices in this trailer was great. Them being actual teenagers really complements the dark gritty environment and situation they‚Äôre facing, which helps them to add comedy as they might‚Äôve never dealt with something like this before. This trailer was absolutely great and I can‚Äôt wait for more news! Thank you to the animation team, Paramount, the voice actors, and everyone involved for making this movie possible!"

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-10-02,I actually watched this to the end and just wanna say that it should TOTALLY be a series. Make it happen nickelodeon!ü§©
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-01,The Turtles having younger-sounding voices is such a nice change of pace. It makes them more relatable for younger kids.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"I love this version already. It&#39;s a cool mix of previous takes on the Turtles, it&#39;s colorful and exciting, GORGEOUS, it has an actual teenage vibe and actors, they do feel young, naive, more childish like just into middle school- bro I&#39;m definitely watching this"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-08-01,"This is honestly everything I&#39;ve wanted in a TMNT movie, solid animation, fun plot and well written characters, I can&#39;t wait to see it in theaters!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,The turtles eyes going white when they get serious was one of the coolest things in the 2012 show i&#39;m glad they brought it back
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-01,This actually looks awesome..

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-07-05,"It‚Äôs honestly refreshing to see Baxter Stockman appearing in a TMNT movie, since most TMNT Films have mostly used The Shredder and The Foot Clan, and they don‚Äôt always execute them in the best way, I‚Äôm sure if the movie succeeds, it will lead to a franchise, as a long time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan, I‚Äôm genuinely excited."

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"Honestly, I kinda love that Shredder doesn&#39;t seem to be the big bad. Going with Baxter Stockman as a main villain is a bold choice, but laying off of Shredder gives a sequel somewhere to go. Maybe introduce Krang as the final boss of a trilogy. I&#39;m excited!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-09-30,Most shocking aspect of this movie to me was the voice acting. Even Ice Cube brought his A game. Dude has seriously grown since the days of Are We There Yet; there were moments I completely forgot it was even him.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,Jackie Chan playing as Splinter is incredible I can‚Äôt wait to go see this in theaters love teenage mutant ninja turtles ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüß°üíú
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-06-04,"What they seem to be doing with Leo by making him want to be the leader but he is always feeling stress, makes me feel like more people can relate to him."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,"I&#39;m absolutely digging what I&#39;m witnessing, the animation style looks so cool in motion and I really love that the Turtles are ACTUALLY teenagers (unlike how 2K3 or Bayverse TMNT depicted them), I can&#39;t wait to see this one, been a fan since the original cartoon and live action trilogy. ‚ù§"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2024-10-02,Donatello&#39;s voice is perfect for tails
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,IHvzw4Ibuho,2023-05-31,I keep getting more impressed by the animation! And I never thought I would be hyped for another origin story after 2014.

Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,Love the vibe of this trailer. It definitely has a darker more sinister tone than the last film.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"Legit looks scary, if this is good then the Scream franchise won‚Äôt have a bad movie IMO"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-11-23,<b>JUSTICE FOR MELISSA BARRERA</b>
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"The ‚Äúshrine room‚Äù has outfits from past killers and victims. You can see Tatum‚Äôs outfit, Billy‚Äôs shirt, Jill‚Äôs outfit, Olivia‚Äôs shirt, etc. So the killer had access somehow to coroner‚Äôs offices or something or some sort of archive. Very creepy and interesting. And the Gale scene looks amazing! also, the scene with Sam and Tara back to back looks like they‚Äôre surrounded by ghost faces maybe? Or atleast the usual two."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-21,"I was just thinking we didn‚Äôt need another Scream, but oh my gosh. Yes, please keep bringing Scream into the new age. It‚Äôs so real and terrifying. Ghostface believes in ‚ÄúAdapt and overcome.‚Äù"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"the cast, the setting, the genre, the return, the mystery. that is why i love scream."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-30,Every Scream movie: This isn&#39;t like any other Ghostface
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,"First off, I love the fact the killer is acting like a killer and is not afraid to kill."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,Looks really good. Looks like the unknowns can possibly act. Seeing him in the store with a shotgun and several potential random victims gave it a modern gritty type of feel. This movie might actually benefit from not having Sydney in it which can allow this plot to move forward.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-26,"I was 17 when the OG film came out and I&#39;m still just as hyped every time! I appreciate this &quot;going big&quot;, but keeping a sense of continuity and self awareness that&#39;s the essence of the franchise."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-11-22,Justice For Melissa Barrera! üíô
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-08,After watching this movie - I came to applaud how well made this trailer it is! It did not give away much of the plot and hypes the movie up perfectly.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,This looks surprisingly promising. I was worried without Neve Campbell returning. I LOVE that we finally get to see Gale get a call from/actually SPEAK with Ghostface for the 1st time in the franchise!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,They can keep making these movies and I‚Äôm going to watch them every single time üòÇ
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-07-12,My fav scene in scream 6 was when I thought ghost face killed mindy<br>My least fav was when I realized she was still alive
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-28,"I just finished a Scream movie marathon, I honestly can&#39;t wait to watch the 6th one. This looks like they really took it to another level"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,"Scream is such a comforting series. All of the films have so many things to love, and so much charm. This film seems darker, and more sinister. Ghostface is grittier and angrier. I can feel the cast simply hit it out of the ballpark with this one. Really happy to see Hayden Panettiere return as Kirby. Also really happy to see Dermott Mulroney, I think he‚Äôs a great actor. This is gonna be badass!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,I cannot wait for new chase scenes in this movie! The one with Mindy on a ladder looks good and I&#39;m kinda scared for Tara a little bit. Sam is definitely going to get the respect she deserves! People were way too harsh on her but she will prove that she deserves to be a final girl!

Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"kevin williamson was right, this feels like a completely new ‚Äúscream‚Äù movie. the creepiness, the returning characters and ghostface looks his best yet. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23screamvi"">#ScreamVI</a>"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,"If you are like me Scream is like comfort horror. I watch for the nostalgia not the scares. The perfect mix of action, comedy, and jump scares that you kinda see coming because you know someone is gonna die you just don&#39;t know who. However, this looks different, like they are handing the torch to the new generation. Still need gale to make it through alive."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,This looks like a really great refresh of this franchise and I love the darker tone and mood. I hope they‚Äôll keep it in the movie as well. That Gale scene looks promising!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-04-25,"I can‚Äôt believe Gale, Kirby, AND Chad all survived. They got stabbed dozens of times. Chad even got double teamed üíÄ"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,"Nothing but chills<br><br>Also I really hope that Gale doesn‚Äôt die but it‚Äôs not looking good for her, then again she‚Äôs survived all of Ghostface‚Äôs attacks"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,"I believe this is a good representation of ghostface. The kills are quick, sneaky, and clever, the best part is that there‚Äôs no losing him easily. I like the confusion on the train when everyone has on the ghostface mask so they cannot tell which one it is, that was cool. I can tell in this movie ghostface isn‚Äôt going to be weak"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,&quot;There&#39;s never been one quite like me Gale. I&#39;m something different.&quot;<br><br>Getting Major Stu Vibes from that Line!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2025-01-19,who&#39;s watching 2025 ??
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"This feels dark, new, fresh and basically everything we needed in a scream film."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-23,&quot;There&#39;s never been one like me.&quot; Literally the mindset of every Ghostface. ü§¶
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"It doesn&#39;t feel like &#39;Part 6&#39; it feels like you&#39;re watching this big, huge, fresh reinvention. I love it. I&#39;m gonna have a big smile on my face when I see this movie. I think it&#39;s everything and more. And going to New York is awesome. The movie feels new, it feels fresh, it feels like a new movie.&#39;&#39;"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2024-11-26,"I find it so funny how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h74AXqw4Opc&amp;t=15"">0:15</a> it looks like he dodged that shot in a frame when in the actual movie it was just slow crouch and flee"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,This scream has a whole different tone and atmosphere to it! Gritty chilling dark creepy. Ghost face normally isn‚Äôt scary but looks terrifying and ruthless in this! Can‚Äôt wait for this! and love Gail hope she survives this one!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"The Shrine room looks incredible! Also I noticed There‚Äôs nine ghostface costumes up on stage to possibly represent the nine killers there have been in prior to scream VI (maybe they planned that? Maybe not?). i&#39;ve been pausing the trailer frame by frame and it looks like they have something from every scream movie, even stuff from Windsor College! Love those additions. This movie looks both nostalgic AND refreshing at the same time...hard to do in the cinema world now a days..<br><br>Also, how AWESOME is the new mask??"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,The seven 11 sound is EVERYTHING. Melissa is looking a lot more engaged in this. Also finally some proper gale chase scenes. High hopes for this really
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-05-15,"I&#39;m sorry but Tara and Sam will never get close to the respect I have for Gale, Dewey an Sidney.<br><br>Scream 1 was lowkey the best movie."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I honestly like the way this is going. I can&#39;t wait to see how the roles change, and more of how the Ghostface killer is different!!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,This movie looks so amazing
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,"5 things I already love. New Setting, Gale gets a phone call, New Ghoseface not hiding and in public attacking people, Kerby is back, Sam&#39;s smile and head tilt reminded me so much of Billy.üòçüëªüì±üíÄ"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-04-15,"Honestly, I feel like this is the first movie that Ghostface uses a gun. And yet he&#39;s still one of the best horror movie antagonists."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-09,One of the few franchises that adapt and improve with time. I&#39;m pumped to see this
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"What I love about this series is that it&#39;s stupidly and weirdly good...u seem to predict the killer but it always shocks u at the end..even though the story is too classic,the series took the world by storm.<br>and this season is just on another level i guess..Jenna and all the other great actors..I can&#39;t wait to watch itüí´üî•"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"This ghost face is definitely not like the others. They feel very dark, sinister, almost non-human in a way. So hyped for this, can&#39;t wait!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h74AXqw4Opc&amp;t=4"">0:04</a> &quot;There&#39;s a line here, girls.&quot; <br>that cashier bro üíÄüíÄ"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,Im so glad Kirby is back. I hope she has a big role in this film.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I&#39;m so nervous for Mindy, Gale, and Kirby. PLEASE don&#39;t kill them."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,The fact that Ghostface can sneak around a major city without getting arrested is just terrifying.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-05-22,Now I‚Äôm scared that that thing might come in my room while I‚Äôm sleeping but I know it won‚Äôt ü§£
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,Scream VI is worth getting excited for. The cast alone have what it takes to deliver such groundbreaking performances.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-25,It&#39;s sad to know that Neve Campbell is not returning for this 6th instalment. She deserved accolades and worth in salary for her role. Paramount did her dirty when it came to her payment
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-28,I think ghost face has the coolest costume of any slasher character‚Ä¶ üêê üíØ
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2025-04-12,Yo I remember when the first one came out I had the biggest crush on Billy Loomis. And just seeing bits and pieces now I still smile
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-11,"Just saw this last night, does not disappoint and is my new favorite of the whole franchise. Don&#39;t miss it on the big screen, this cast is bringing it big time."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I LOVE that they brought Kirby back!! I thought they had just completely forgotten about that character, because I was like 80 percent sure she was still alive. That is honestly so cool.. I‚Äôm definitely excited for this.<br><br>Edit: I also hope we get a Sidney appearance, it wouldn‚Äôt be the same without her. OR maybe the killer is Sidney this time hmm? Finally mentally snapped after all these years, the reason this Ghostface seems like its going to be a lot smarter than previous ones.?? (This is a joke btw)"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,I love how they&#39;re really taking advantage of the new setting and new ways that Ghostface can instill death and terror. Especially if certain plot details are any indication of how Ghostface to this day remains both in universe and out of universe such a horrifying idea.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-12-19,It&#39;s now December and I&#39;ve seen this movie like 5 times but I keep coming back to this trailer because it&#39;s so frigging awesome!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,It only took 6 movies for Ghostface to call Gale. Should be well worth the wait!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I have to admit, this isn‚Äôt quite what I expected, but in the best possible way! This feels sinister, it feels evil. Although Sidney isn‚Äôt in this movie, which is still a shame, I really think it‚Äôll deliver regardless. Looking forward to this!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,i love the shrine that ghostface has! i love this vibe for the film! i love that sam is getting the recognition she deserves! i‚Äôm nervous for Gale!! if they kill her omg i will RAGE!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,"Me and my best mate loved the scream franchise and used to watch all the movies together. The 4th one came out when we were in high school and when they made a fifth, we went to the movies together to watch, and it was one of the best memories of my life. He passed away last year. I&#39;m going to watch this one for the both of us."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-21,"Props to the sound designer for this new sequel, it totally adds to the new feel of the franchise. As an oldschool horror film buff, I&#39;m looking forward to this instalment."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,I am super hyped and excited for Scream VI! Ghostface is one of the best horror villains of all time! The fact that anyone can be Ghostface is terrifying. Also Kirby is back!!!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,Gale finally getting her first official 1 on 1 call with a Ghostface! OMG<br><br>Everything seems so fast and paced. Super cannot wait for this. Promising and definitely got all of us hooked that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m getting Scream 2-ish vibes with the Gale Weathers scene!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"This trailer is EVERYTHING!! Really rooting for Scream VI! This made my entire year! <br><br>March 10, it‚Äôs a date!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,It actually looks like it&#39;s going to be so good. Really dark. Please let Ghostface NOT be a joke. Please.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2025-03-16,Saw it during my flight to France last summer. It&#39;s my favourite &quot;Scream&quot; sequel alongside the classic 1996 Wes Craven movie.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-28,"So grateful for Wes making this franchise come to life but I‚Äôm very happy with the direction Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are going with these new films. This trailer Gave me chills. I loved Scream 5, can‚Äôt wait for this one"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-27,Scream is probably the most consistent horror franchise and this looks like it&#39;s gonna be another great one
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-20,"Samara Weaving = Opening Kill<br><br>Sam‚Äôs head tilt‚Ä¶definitely killer vibe. Also the mask she‚Äôs holding in the trailer, I definitely feel like it‚Äôs her dad‚Äôs mask. <br><br>Tara‚Äôs face while dangling from the building‚Ä¶definitely suspicious and sinister. <br><br>The commentary of this movie definitely feels like the sensationalizing of the Scream Killings, like Dahmer is doing on Netflix, and having the victims relive their trauma. <br><br>I hope Gale doesn‚Äôt die, but with Dewey gone, and being through the ringer herself‚Ä¶this might be it for her. <br><br>Kirby NEEDS to survive, because if they brought her back to kill her‚Ä¶I will riot because what was the point?"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-05-15,Favorite movie outta all of them so far. Courtney cox&#39;s 7min scene she had when talkin to ghost face was definitely my favorite part of the movie
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-28,Cannot wait to see it but it&#39;s difficult to see Scream without Sidney and Dewey.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,THIS. IS. HOW. YOU. MAKE. A. TRAILER!!!!<br>THIS DESERVES AN APPLAUSE AND STANDING OVATION!!!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"Been a huge fan since the first film and I don&#39;t care what anyone says, this one looks amazing. I love the really dark vibe. I love the complete re-vamp of the entire premise by having it set in New York. Can&#39;t wait to watch!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-11-01,Scream 2 is the best sequel in the franchise still.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,"This is why Scream will forever be the GOAT. Every movie is a legit production and event, with great and innovative quality. A fan since 1996 until the end!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"This is such a minor thing, but it really warms my heart that random guy instantly began protecting the girls once he realized some green was making them uncomfortable.  Also, respect to the shop owner for pulling out the shotgun.  Normally I&#39;d say so uncivilized, but today is the exception."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-12-11,"‚ÄúYou want me,So let‚Äôs Finish This.‚Äù I wish this line was in the movieüò´"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,Him saying &quot;I&#39;m something different&quot; and jumping over the couch was the best part for me because in a previous Scream movie he would have tripped over the couch and went face first into the ground
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"This is going to be one of those movies that everyone even people who don‚Äôt like horror will go see, because it just looks that DAMN GOOD!!!! Can‚Äôt wait"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-11-22,The trailer for the final scream movie wow
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I love how hard this trailer goes. I&#39;m glad to to Hayden Panettiere back as kirby, its been too long since she&#39;s been in something. So hyped for this movie."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2024-02-10,I just watched this movie on netflix it was so so cool i regomend this movie!
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-23,Gosh i hope Gale doesnt die she really is a great character in the series
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h74AXqw4Opc&amp;t=13"">0:13</a> Those two people that immediately ran away outside near the door survived because they use their brains and I love itü§£ü§£üíñ"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,I love the tension in some of these scenes. The cat and mouse scene with ghostface and the shotgun in the convenience store reminds me of Gale‚Äôs scene in 2. And the scene with Mindy on the ladder reminds me of the car scene in 2. 6 is definitely gonna work it‚Äôs way up to one of my favorites in the franchise
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-12-03,"Scream VI (2023) <br>Directors: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett <br>Filming Dates: June 9, 2022 - August 30, 2022 <br>Release Date: March 10, 2023 <br>MPAA Rating: R [Restricted] <br>Runtime: 2 hr 2 min (122 min)"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-01,It feels so weird seeing Ghost Face use a gun in the best way
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,SCREAM CAN NEVER GET OLD. And I&#39;m actually proud that each movie they made is GOOD and makes SENSE.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I love how this Ghostface actually acts like a killer, he feels like an actual serial killer and isn‚Äôt afraid to go and kill people. I‚Äôm happy that we finally got Kirby back, and the fact that this is taking place in a city like New York is just wild! Gale finally gets a call from Ghostface, and so much more. Im hyped for this."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-04-01,"This movie was amazing, and the plot twist was great too!"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"I love how this movie keeps having sequels after sequels but they are never boring to watch. Also, SCREAM is the best slasher horror movie ever since."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-25,"I‚Äôm excited for this one but am I the only one that hated Scream 5 and just didn‚Äôt find Sam likeable, especially not enough to be the new final girl. Tara was more well just everything tbh."
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,"What I really loved about this trailer is that it&#39;s embracing the full violence, horror that Ghost face has. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the sarcasm comedy of the franchise, but I&#39;m truly loving that it&#39;s getting more dark now. Plus, this Ghostface looks more violent than the others, which is very good! üî™üî™üî™"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-05-06,Gotta love how they made Ghostface more straight to the point and brutal in these new films.
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-02-08,I haven&#39;t watched any scream movie but seeing just this trailer makes me really wanna watch them
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-19,The fun thing about this franchise is none of the movies are bad and they all are so rewatch able and this one looks like it‚Äôll keep the streak going
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-03-10,"Excellent, excellent film. A massive improvement from number 5. Strong acting, bigger body count, a more brutal killer, tense scenes (the supermarket, the train and the apartment)....they really delivered on this one. Well done"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-07-09,"This one was so muchhh better than scream 5 , Scream 6 is worth watching , its not disappointing üëçüèº"
Scream VI,h74AXqw4Opc,2023-01-22,I was very skeptical at first knowing that Sydney wasn&#39;t going to be in this movie. But judging by this trailer I&#39;m definitely going to watch it no doubt. This looks bad ass
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"Ezra Miller, the only person to be the flash and reverse flash in real life"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"Nearly 35 years later, and Michael Keaton still got it."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"Seeing Zod again brings back great memories of watching Man Of Steel in theaters. Batfleck and Keaton are gonna kill it in this movie. If we never see them again after the reboot, they better go out with a bang."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-07-21,Michael Keaton has still got it! They even brought back the 1989 Batman music theme.... Nostalgia hits hard!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,It‚Äôs honestly cool to see a much older Batman and the fact they got Michael Keaton to return is awesome
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman music gave me chills man. Can&#39;t wait to see him back as Batman.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,This might be the last time we get to see Michael Keaton as Batman since the entire universe is getting reboot so this better be worth it for his comeback at the very least
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-07-29,I just watched it like two weeks ago and I was impressed by Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman. He was the most active Batman in the whole movie and his fast fighting skills were the best thing I have ever seen.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Am I the only one happy to see General Zod?<br><br>Edit: Some savage replies in here
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,Seeing Michael Shannon back as Zod is so cool.<br><br>He was such a great villain in MOS.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Great to see both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck on screen again.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-02-21,His double acting is underrated.  I honestly like this movie
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-17,I know we&#39;re all excited to see Michael Keaton as Batman again. So am I. But is anyone else besides me happy to see Michael Shannon as General Zod again?
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,When everyone is delighted and excited with the return of Michael Keaton as Batman. It only shows how iconic he is and how people loved and admired his character as Batman.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Giving Keaton the action he deserves is an absolute joy to watch. Imagine Affleck teams with Keaton in this movie<br><br>Edit: Mom I‚Äôm famous!!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-06-26,This trailer makes it seem so much more serious than it actually was.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"I loved seeing Michael Shannon as Zod, reprising his great role from Man of Steel, as well as seeing Ben Affleck as Batman once again. Michael Keaton getting a final swan song for his character is nice too. This makes me want to go watch Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and ZL Justice League again."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Seeing Ben Affleck and Michael Shannon again was insane!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-28,"Let‚Äôs not forget this, Michael Keaton is 71 and he still takes on the Batman role!! What a legend üò≠"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-02-12,Couldn&#39;t believed that it&#39;s been one year.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Seeing General Zod And Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman Puts A Smile On My Face.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Batman is so iconic that even his silhouette is enough to generate excitement.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,The score during Keaton‚Äôs introduction and fight was perfect! I‚Äôm so excited!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-07-06,Am i the only one who feels this movie is criminally underrated. It&#39;s a perfect superhero movie. I was shocked when i came to knew it flopped at box office.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,This was so sick. Can&#39;t believe they actually got Michael Keaton back. I am also really happy that Ben Affleck is actually part of the movie. This movie is going to shatter a lot of records for sure.I also can&#39;t believe we are getting a live action flashpoint movie.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Hearing that Batman Score at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hebWYacbdvc&amp;t=93"">1:33</a> brings me back to childhood. That‚Äôs my Batman."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Words cannot describe how amazing it feels to see Michael Keaton back as Batman
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-07-30,I cried at the scene of him with his mother at the storeüò≠üò≠üò≠
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-16,"Gosh. Hearing Batman say &quot;I&#39;m Batman,&quot; then Batmanning all over the place was truly one of the moments of all time"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-19,When Ezra Miller said &quot;Its Running Time&quot; and ran from the law was truly spectacular. Bravo vince
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-14,"Made me feel like a kid again with Michael Keaton back as Batman and saying his iconic line, &quot;I&#39;m Batman,&quot; with his Batman theme puts a smile on my face and shed a tear of joy!!!"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-07-01,Oh absolutely.  I love it when they bring back actors from the past to play roles again.... Spiderman did it beautifully and this seems to be great too.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m almost 40 or because DC movies haven&#39;t been doing it right for so long, but Michael Keaton is the reason I want to see this movie."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Man Michael Keaton just embodies everything about Batman. The way he delivers his lines is so witty just like Batman from the comics.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Ben looks great here! I know he‚Äôs not going to be in it for long, but he‚Äôs so well suited for this role. It‚Äôll be sad to see him go."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-09-19,I&#39;m not ashamed to admit that I cried multiple times during this movie.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-19,The fact that Michael Shannon is coming back to play as General Zod again for this film is just another whole new level.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-16,"General Zod is so badass! He is one of my favorite villains. Unique personality, crazy passion for his people, warrior.... Glad to see him back."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,‚ÄúI‚Äôm Batman‚Äù still sends shivers down my spine
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-08-21,The most underrated superhero movie in all history
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"I can see why people were hyped for Bat Keaton. I wasn&#39;t even born when his movies came out, yet I got goosebumps seeing him. There&#39;s something about his screen presence."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,FINALLY A DC FILM THAT I WANT TO SEE IN CINEMA!!!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"I don‚Äôt know how to describe this movie but it somehow feels, like an actual sense of danger and genuine fantasy."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-06-21,"I just saw this movie, no spoilers but folks I went in wanting to hate it. I actually really enjoyed it. All controversies aside, I really liked this movie. Not calling it a GOAT, not calling it anything except just an enjoyable time. I was really surprised but pleasantly surprised."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Alongside Keaton&#39;s return I&#39;m happy and excited about Shanon&#39;s return as zod
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Words cannot describe how amazing it feels to see Michael back as Batman

The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"I saw Michael Keaton as Batman in the theater when it came out when I was a kid. So cool to see him back,"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Barry ran so fast, he erased his grooming and kidnapping charges from the time line"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,Looks like Andy absolutely nailed this. It‚Äôs such a shame that there‚Äôs so much negative baggage.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2025-03-10,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hebWYacbdvc&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> this image has done irreperable damage to the internet"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,This movie looks like just the right story to reset everything as advertised. Those that are aware with flashpoint know what a heartbreaking story it has the potential to be. Especially if executed well in the live action format.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"no wonder why they didn‚Äôt wanna scrap this movie, it looks AMAZING"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,im waitting 5 years for this... since i was 18
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-09-03,This movie was awesome! It had some flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed! <br><br>I don&#39;t know why the reviews were unnecessarily harsh. Would recommend!<br><br>&quot;Phasing&quot; was truly cool to see! Unlike any thing in super hero movies.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,I do hope one day we can see affeck as Batman in some multiversal battle. But for now this will be the last time we see him for a long time.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Wow Keaton still looks totally badass in the batsuit even after 30 years! He needs to be given his own Batman film, and this is not a request it&#39;s an order!"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Although Ezra Miller is an Avengers level threat, I‚Äôm excited to see this"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-01-19,"I was impressed finding hard to accept that this was a box office bomb. For me it was one of the best superhero movies I‚Äôve ever seen. I watched it on cable and just assumed it was another hit. This movie is smart, funny with great special effects."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-17,It&#39;s nice to see Ezra in something other than a law suit
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,This is Where The Old  DC Universe comes to a close I&#39;m hoping they do this right regardless of the contversy about everything going I&#39;m still looking forward to this movie
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,we‚Äôre all gonna miss Ben after this üò¢
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-12-18,When Keaton&#39;s Batman was revealed with Burton&#39;s theme. Unbelievable. We thought we&#39;d never see him after Batman Returns.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"About 32 years ago Michael Keaton passed on Batman Forever due to changes in tone and overall take on the dark knight from what Tim Burton had crafted. Personally, Keaton made the right call. I cannot believe Keaton is finally getting a worthy Batman sequel he should‚Äôve gotten 30 years ago. <br>Don‚Äôt disappoint."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Aside from Erza being an absolute menace to society, I have to say this is literally what every single DC fans wants and I&#39;m also very excited to see this film"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-03-07,"Barry&#39;s reaction to Michael Keaton Batman totally represents me, I am 42 years old but my inner child got really excited to see this man say once again: &quot;I am Batman&quot;"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-06-22,Such a great movie<br>Sad it&#39;s failing for the controversy
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Excited or not, you gotta admit this trailer looks INSANE."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-03-19,Everyone excited to see Keatons Batman back but can we all appreciate the fact that this may be Ben Afflecks last time as The Batman!? Good to see him back. Gonna miss him.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hebWYacbdvc&amp;t=104"">1:44</a> finally after all these year Michael Keaton return with his legendary line back to movie"

The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Ben Affleck just gives off Batman‚Äôs vibes‚Ä¶He was excellent.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-04-29,Cool that The Flash is getting a cameo in this new Batman.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,This looks really good. But it just breaks my heart that Cavill is not a part of this.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-08-26,"Warner Bros. I don&#39;t know who in your studio is responsible for CGI, but in my opinion these people should be fired. CGI looks like a wax museum. I won&#39;t even mention the rest, because there would not be enough space in the comment."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-14,Did anyone else get goosebumps when Keaton said I‚Äôm Batman
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-16,The Michael Keaton line&quot;yah l&#39;m Batman&quot;<br> really gave me goosebumps
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-02-03,"just finished watching the movie, it‚Äôs actually good. great writing, directing, &amp; acting. more ppl should give it a. chance"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Oh my goodness the trailer gave me goosebumps. This exceeds what I expected. It is time for DC !!!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,The timing when Keaton said the line was perfect. He nailed it.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"As a Flash fan, I&#39;ve been waiting for so many years to have a Flashpoint movie. I&#39;m so happy to finally see it ! ‚ù§"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-12-16,"I am Just rewatching this trailer again, <br>The Moment Barry says , &quot;We created a world with No Meta Humans and now we don&#39;t have anyone to protect ourselves&quot; , and then Michael Keaton still Shows up as Batman, to say &quot;Want some help?&quot; , <br>The LEGEND still Lives in every universe to fight till the end. Just Literal GOOSEBUMPS ‚ù§‚ù§,<br>And i Just need to say SASHA CALLE is so stunningly Beautful and Graceful ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"I know about all the controversies surrounding Ezra, but dang this trailer makes me hyped! The last appearance of Ben Affleck‚Äôs Batman is going to be great, but I was excited to see Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman back. I knew he was coming back from the cast list, but his actions in this trailer make me even more intrigued to watch this."
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,It&#39;s so good to see Michael Keaton as Batman. Can&#39;t wait for this movie
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,The line by Michael Keaton &quot; I am Batman&quot;  give me chillsüî•üî•
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-02-13,"Very good movie, either the M.K. part, where he LITERALLY &quot;awakens&quot;, from his lethargy, by Flash and show himself ONCE AGAIN, that he IS Batman, by coming into action SHAVED/CHANGED from the previous look! Loved that! Either actually, i didn&#39;t knew that Batman can get depressed, as he is resistent to ANYTHING, but i am glad that HE&#39;S BACK! 10 + üî•üî•üî•üí™üí™üí™üëäüëäüëä"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Frankly I&#39;m going to watch the movie for Keaton&#39;s sakes.<br>Hope one day they&#39;ll resume Batman Beyond project with him on it.<br>It could be in Elseworld but still watching Keaton still got it makes me wanna see it!
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-12,"Men, we are all gonna miss Ben Affleck‚Äôs and Henry‚Äôs roles. ü•≤"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-19,As a DC fan it warms my heart to see so many people excited for this movie.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-07-01,"I saw this movie twice. I really liked it, seen it with a bunch of friends last night and just seen it again with my mom. ‚ù§"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-26,When Ezra said &quot;it&#39;s flashin&#39; time&quot; and flashed all the kids in 10km radius it was truly a moment... Very directed movie
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO SEE MORE OF MICHAEL SHANNON AS GENERAL ZOD
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Low key, I think everyone wants this to be a Batman movie üòÇ"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-01-21,I cannot believe this film flopped... It&#39;s a really good movie. For once the recent DC universe got it right
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,Yo I did not expect general Zod but gah dang HE IS BACK! Hopefully he&#39;ll be a good antagonist. Also Michael Keaton Batman is very nice as well
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,When Michael Keaton said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Batman‚Äù it gave me so many childhood memories
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-02-13,"Hearing that original Batman score as Keaton comes into frame gives me goosebumps üòÆ, I can‚Äôt wait to see this, so hyped ü•≥"
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2024-04-29,Casting Director - &quot;We need his girlfriend to be a 3/10 so modern women can feel like they&#39;re attractive&quot;.
The Flash,hebWYacbdvc,2023-03-23,"That line, &quot;I&#39;m Batman&quot; takes me back. It&#39;s 1989 and I&#39;m ten years old again. Gets me in the feels every time I see it."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"Seeing Megan dance can cross the barrier of being unsettling, creepy and hilarious. Even If It might not be a great film, they nailed the doll&#39;s visual concept. The team understood the assignment on the uncanny valley."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-17,Her expressionless face as she slays those dance moves gets me.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,Megan understood the assignment and completed with such Grace and showing no mercy. Amazing job Megan.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-03,"Of course, we came back here after the M3GAN 2.0 trailer."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-17,I just love how it goes from heartwarming to completely violent and hilarious<br>I watched it at least 20 times already. The dance slays
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,You can‚Äôt lie Megan was killing it üò≠
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"Came for the horror, stayed for the dance."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-08-21,ITS NICE TO HAVE A FRIEND GETTING THE APPRECIATION IT DESERVES !!!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-18,Serious tones. To heart-warming. To Horror vibes. To straight up comedy.<br><br>This is thing to be a hoot in the theaters
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-15,those dance moves ??? she&#39;s literally slaying while slaying people
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,"&quot;I thought we were having a conversation.&quot;<br>Yep, that sent shivers down my bones."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-08-01,Best movie ever made. Biggest plot twist ever. Nobody can predict the ending.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-14,It&#39;s nice to see Renesme growing out of her Twilight phase. Good for her.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,That dance move is going to be a meme for sure
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-14,Her dance moves aren‚Äôt the only thing that slays.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-04,It went from horror to action and it feels great
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,It‚Äôs nice to have a friend has always been so creepy I‚Äôve been waiting for it to be used in a horror movie forever
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"Okay but did Megan really HAVE to make such a strong statement with those dance moves and style???<br>Like, she really turned up to the house with sunglasses and a sickening jacket, and then began to KILL THE DANCE FLOOR???<br>She really deserves to own the house."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,"If this movie doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously, it might actually be 10/10"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-02-03,Who here after that m3han 2.0 teaser?
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-21,That aerial cartwheel and skanky dance move against the wall are EVERYTHING
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"She&#39;s got a point, she&#39;s an ICON, she&#39;s a LEGEND and she is THE MOMENT."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,a doll that protects her friend from evil. looks pretty wholesome.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-03,who else is watching this after the second trailer?
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,That dance kill scene tho I gotta see this
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-14,"I was with it, and then she hit that dance. I was like hold up. It‚Äôs like child‚Äôs play meets dancing with the stars üòÇ"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-30,I‚Äôve watched her dance over and over üòÇüòÇ Megan was killing it
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-03,"Came back after watching the sequel&#39;s trailer and oh god, someone tampered with the genre"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-17,I started laughing as soon as Megan ran on all fours. I need to see this in theaters.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,Megan understood the assignment! Her aunt literally said don&#39;t let anything harm Cady physically or emotionally.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,Megan is the friend we all need and deserve.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-08-31,"‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt look confused, she looks demented.‚Äù PUHLEASE üò≠"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,This looks hysterical
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-14,"Judging by that outfit and the dance moves after the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRb4U99OU80&amp;t=120"">2:00</a> mark, it looks like M3GAN is going to be slaying in more ways than one."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-20,I felt a roller coaster of emotions in just 2 1/2 minutes: from wholesome to creepy to hilarity ensues üòÇ
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-08,who&#39;s back after the m3gan 2.0 trailer?
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,This is like a combination of &quot;Child&#39;s Play&quot; meets &quot;The Orphan&quot; with &quot;The Good Son&quot; sprinkled in to make a very cool-looking film!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,"i like the idea that she&#39;s a protector, it makes it almost eerily comforting...as if we&#39;re on her side"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRb4U99OU80&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> proof this is going to be a meme 100%"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2024-02-17,If I had a robot like Megan she would be like a sister to me‚ù§
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,I never expected &quot;it&#39;s nice to have a friend&quot; to be used in a horror film but tbh it kinda slaps.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-14,"Megan took the orders literally - don‚Äôt let anyone harm Cady, and she didn‚Äôt! And those dance moves were badass! üï∫üèº"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,The dance moves and her running on all fours....I can dig it!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-04,Those who came here after watching its Sequel Trailer.<br><br>üëáüèª
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,You can always tell when futuristic horror is about to happen because they make something creepy as hell and act like it&#39;s totally normal.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"The concept of making the doll a protector who takes her role too far, but is still so child-like that she enjoys it and wants to dance gives it an eerie element of fun. The doll‚Äôs ability to articulate herself at an adult level is startling all on its own, and her running on all fours üò≥ with, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have a friend,‚Äù is perfect! I‚Äôm here for how lifelike the doll looks, talks and moves. Her hair is better laid than some real people outchea. üëÄüíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ü§£ Go ‚Äòhead M3GAN!"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-15,"Why do I find this so sweet?! Having someone to protect you from any kind harm is... a really huge thing. Megan over did it, but she did it. She understood her assignment properly and like a good robot completed it. It&#39;s not her fault that many human things are not just black and white like her commands suggest."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-04,Who came from the 2nd trailer???
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,M3gan has more loyalty than most human beings
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-27,"This is really something. Megan‚Äôs eyes, her movements, and her voice is what makes her creepy. The dancing is funny and random at the same time. The music is great. I love when artists‚Äô music is used as horror music for trailers or even as a eerie song choice for a scene in a film.<br><br>Also, this film is in my Birthday Month. This will be a treat for me to see when it comes out in theaters."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,"Not gonna lie,  the middle ground between her being real and a robot is mentally messing with me.  She moves to well lol"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-05,Who watching movies m3gan(2023) movies again for waiting m3gan 2.0 release
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-12-15,When she got down and crawled after that dude I literally burst out laughing
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-12-14,&quot;You lost your parents&quot; &quot;You&#39;re my niece&quot;<br><br>And the oscar for best dialogue goes to...

M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-09-06,"Without the laws of robotics programmed into AI, it&#39;s frightening to think of how far off track things could go in the real world IF this was even possible."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-12-22,what a horrifyingly brilliant use of ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice to have a friend‚Äù
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,And &quot;It&#39;s nice to have a friend&quot; will never be the same again
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have a friend‚Äù getting the love and attention it deserves

M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,It would be nice to have a friend that sounds so eerie. Can&#39;t wait to see it!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,Just came here again to see her dance moves!<br>She&#39;s killing it with grace!!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-13,"As someone that love tech, android, robotic and futuristic movies this is a combination of creepy, interesting, funny and horror. I&#39;ll give it a watch."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-03,"Yay üéâmegan 2 is here ,finally"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,Ok the part where she runs on all fours is both creepy and absolutely hilarious at the same time üòÇ
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,"i was expecting this to be like a chucky knock-off, but the fact that the doll has real human movement and can dance, im interested in this"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-17,Am I the only one who laughed the way Megan started to dance like go gurll kill it!ü§£ I&#39;m excited to see those movesü§£
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-06-09,"This trailer alone made me cry , i never felt this kind of horror from any sci-fi movie."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,when she said &quot; i thought we were having a conversation &quot; it made me goosebumps its going to be good movie for sure
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,The whole theater tonight was busting out laughing at her dancing ü§£ had to come back to this trailer to see it again!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-04-11,This movie should had been over 1M likes üíÄüò≠ LIKE WHAT THIS IS THE MOST SLAYING HORROR MOVIE I SEEN YET EVERYONE A NEW CHILDHOOD IS COMING IN AYEE
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-01-19,"went to see it last night thinking Id be unable to sleep but the audience in the cinema last night genuinely laughed around 20 times ; the bit when Megan sang titanium brought the house down and by the dance, the family sat infront of me were choking on their popcorn. Im lost for words"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,&#39;&#39;It&#39;s nice to have a friend&#39;&#39; getting the love it deserves
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,the way she moves so human like it‚Äôs so creepy ‚ÄúI thought we were having a conversation‚Äù sent me instant chills and that crawl she did on all 4s towards the boy üòü she‚Äôs definitely the scariest
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-08-20,I liked this movie a lot more than I was anticipating.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRb4U99OU80&amp;t=45"">0:45</a> was genuinely the most startling moment of the trailer for me. I didn&#39;t expect her to be walking or moving like that."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-19,My heart stated racing when she got on all fours. Did not see that one coming
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,The dance scene when shes on the war path! Omg why have we got to wait until January! This looks like such a good film
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-04,I never thought that MEGAN 2.0 would not be the same.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"The dances, flips and everything about the girl robot makes me want to see this so bad"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-20,This gives a whole new feel to Taylors &#39;It&#39;s Nice To Have A Friend&#39; - love that she&#39;s allowed it to be used!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-18,I like how it starts out really wholesome then just amps it up to over 9000
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-04,Who‚Äôs ever after the Megan 2.0 trailer.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2023-01-20,This movie portrays the negligence of irl parents leaving their kids to the devices for support and the consequences of it. The message it is displaying is amazing.<br>This was a great horror thriller movie. I&#39;d definitely watch it again. üëç
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,Freaking chills... wish it was coming out this Halloween.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-19,"Megan seems like the type of humanoid robot who‚Äôd secretly camp out in the backyard of your home. Whatever happens, she will do what it takes to go undefeated. So far, it‚Äôs impressive how the actress portraying Megan in this embodies the character so well. Hopefully she gets to be further recognized in the realm of horror movies."
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-05,2025 ANYONE Megan 2.0
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-18,"Yo hold up. She has amazing fashion style, can run on all 4s, has super strength, intellect AND SHE GOT THEM MOVES? <br>90% of the audience is going to be cheering for M3GAN"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-15,Tbh‚Ä¶.. let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶.she was killing that danceüòÇüòÇüòÇ
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,Actually cried laughing at the dancing. That completeley blindsided me
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2024-02-14,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have a friend‚Äù üòÑ<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have a friend‚Äù üòà
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-12-18,the dances she does in the hallway and when she‚Äôs killing everybody I can‚Äôt it‚Äôs so funnyüòÇ
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-11,I can already tell this is going to be a great watch! Seems campy but also creepy. So looking forward to it!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-12-11,My main thing with creepy doll/toy movies is how unrealistic it is that a child would want that toy because of how creepy it is. If someone gave me a Megan I&#39;d be terrified.
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-17,Here after watching the M3GAN 2.0 trailer!
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-15,This looks really cool. Allison is fantastic. Loved her in Get Out and Perfection
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-12,"The dancing part was creepy, hilarious, unsettling, confusing and strange.. üòÇ the concept has been used tons of times but if they can get the FEEL, and get you to experience this different emotions thru out the movie it can be a classic"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2022-10-16,"Megan really was worried about her having to eat vegetables but then said, ‚Äúmurdering anyone who created any kind of conflict at all would be good for you and your development‚Äù üòÇ"
M3GAN,BRb4U99OU80,2025-04-23,If the plan was to create a scary movie they fumbled imo.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Megan lowkey hitting that shi thoüó£üó£üî•üî•

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known.&quot;<br><br>Glad to see that the people behind the development of this film drew their inspiration from actual D&amp;D parties.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-26,"When he said &quot;We&#39;ll need strength&quot; I expected him to follow that up with &quot;and also dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom... and charisma&quot;."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-12-02,"For the real DnD experience, the movie should stop halfway through the adventure. Then everyone in the cinema has to schedule a time when they can finish the film."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-29,Just got back from the theater. Was expecting nothing special and was surprised to find an actually solid and enjoyable movie. Funny and emotional at times. Great stuff!
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-24,One of the party members better be unexplainably absent for at least a week and then magically re-appear for the real DnD experience
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-26,Chris&#39; little kick step while lute strumming at the end is perfection.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,This is genuinely good D&amp;D energy.<br>The DM is trying his hardest to tell a serious story but the players are having none of that.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-01,"This has &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy goes medieval fantasy&quot; written all over it, and I&#39;m down for that."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-04,1. The protagonists &quot;unleash the greatest evil.&quot;<br>2. There is an owlbear.<br>3. There is a mimic disguised as a treasure chest.<br>4. The Bard is being mocked for being useless.<br>This movie is certainly made by true experienced D&amp;D geeks.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"This looks like the director dmed a campaign for the main cast and turned it into a script, which is the vibe I want from. A dnd movie"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-25,They should release like character sheets for the party. That would be swell.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-15,"I was blown away by how accurate to DnD this movie was. It feels like a love letter to DnD made by people who play DnD. I was expecting the usual watered down &quot;made for general audiences&quot; MCU style film and instead we got what was essentially a DnD campaign in movie form. Everything from the locations, to the spells, to the monsters, to the magic items all perfectly represented DnD. The film also utilizes show-dont-tell in a way that most Hollywood movies struggle with due to their need for as general of an audience as possible. Nobody needs to explain the bag of holding, or what a displacer beast is, or how breaking concentration affects certain spells, unless the explanation itself is relevant to the plot. Even when they do explain things, it never feels clunky or out of place."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,This looks WAYYY better than I was expecting. Looks pretty fun tbh
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"Owlbear, Displacer Beast and Mimic look awesome. Seems like they are capturing a bit of the spirit of party dynamics and the chaos of the dice. I&#39;m hopeful."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,I‚Äôm impressed they went with a black dragon. A Red‚Äôs fire breath is so iconic that you naturally would expect it to be the lead but no we get a black flying over just puking acid all over an army well played trailer well played
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-30,"Watched it last night at the early release, was definitely a fun night! The movie doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, that‚Äôs the best part"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-01,&quot;So you make plans that fail.&quot;  Lol.  Every D&amp;D party ever.  Some plans succeed.  But almost always a ton of chaos in the process.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-25,"They should do a post-credit scene where the cast from the original D&amp;D movie is siting around a table playing D&amp;D, with Jeremy Irons as the DM, and someone says &quot;this story was a lot better than the first one we did&quot;.  Would be hilarious!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-25,if you guys have these thieves struggle to open a simple door with a lock or if the rogue doesn&#39;t have some traumatic backstory about being raised by the &quot;streets&quot; and get&#39;s made fun of for being edgy I will tell all my mates that this is the best action/fantasy movie ever made
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-13,"Wow, didnt expect that. Fantastic film,  better than anything Disney/Marvel have released  over the last few years.  High tier action adventure with Monty Python humour.   8.5/10"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"This actually looks like it‚Äôll be genuinely fun. The cast looks super charismatic and it really gives off the group of idiots that stumble into some world threatening adventure, but they show how manage to BS their way through it somehow. Exactly like a DnD campaign usually goes"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,Avoiding a Displacer Beast by hiding in a Gelatinous Cube? That&#39;s the DND shenanigans I&#39;m here for!
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-25,Saw this last night. It&#39;s a lot of fun. The characters and their individual quirks are really strong. It&#39;s a cinema film for sure. Quite funny in parts too. Imma see it again.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-10,"as a Bard player, &quot;&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known... but we are going to fix it&quot;   gets me going haha"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"i love how to someone who hasn&#39;t played d&amp;d, this looks like the chosen heroes going on an epic and dangerous world ending quest. and it is, no doubt. however for d&amp;d that&#39;s just your average sunday. there&#39;s five other adventuring parties on other continents doing this exact same thing right now. perfect"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,Having Chris Pine be the bard is legitimately great casting.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-03,"I love this movie so much!!! All the characters are amazing, they play off each other really well (essential for a D&amp;D party) and the plot is simple but extremely effective. It&#39;s got heart, and humor, and quite a few extremely epic action sequences so it&#39;s a 10/10 in my book! Can&#39;t wait for it to come to streaming so I can watch it again!!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"I&#39;ve always felt that the best way to make a D&amp;D movie would be to have the main cast play through a campaign, and then write the film from that. This definitely feels like that&#39;s what they did!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"I REALLY want this to be epic, because then that opens the door to a huge source of film material.<br>Dragonlance, Faerun, Eberron... so many places full of wonderful stories"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-07,"So worth seeing on the big screen.  The cast was great, loved the tongue-in-cheek humor, wonderful mix of practical/special effects and gorgeous overall design."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,I&#39;m ECSTATIC at the fact that it&#39;s not a classic band of heroes who are all righteous and perfect. It&#39;s a band-of-misfits adventure to fix their mistakes and save the world and that&#39;s EXACTLY what d&amp;d is. Thank you.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-10-17,&quot;So you make plans that fail&quot;<br>Every session summed up in one line.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-25,They had me at Chris Pine as a <b>*BARD*</b> and then they had me smiling at the correct damage type coming from the correct dragon color.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-11-12,"This movie was awesome. I haven‚Äôt played a game of dnd in my life, but it was legitimately a fantastic fantasy film. It‚Äôs honestly a shame it didn‚Äôt do well and didn‚Äôt break even. <br><br>A lot of effort went into it. I hope it does well in home video and streaming."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-23,"I came here expecting this to be an utter let down after playing/dming for 30+ years and never seeing D&amp;D treated with the respect it deserves. Taking the Guardians of the Galaxy, light hearted, fun route was genius; even though I prefer more of the Ravenloft/Dark Fantasy/Grimdark vibe. Chris Pine as a bard and not a fighter/warrior class makes me happy. Now hoping the trailer isn‚Äôt the whole movie and there is much more to come. Wishing them nothing but success in hope we get more than one film honoring D&amp;D."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-23,"You know what stands out to me the most? The fact that I immediately spotted 5 monsters in this trailer that are relatively unique to D&amp;D, rather than just generic fantasy/mythology creatures. You&#39;ve got the owlbear (obviously), mimic, displacer beast, gelatinous cube, and a dragon with a non-fire breath weapon. (Black dragon with an acid line breath attack?)<br><br>Also, the shield effect that looks like what Eric the Cavalier used to do in the old D&amp;D cartoon.<br><br>And lots of other stuff that may or may not be unique to D&amp;D, or just come from generic fantasy. Speaking of which, is satyr a player race in D&amp;D these days?"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"This looks like something straight out of a bunch of friends sitting around playing DnD with its story and I am aaaaaaalllllllllll for it.<br><br>Its the only way to make a DnD film, and I&#39;m glad they decided on this route instead of something super serious."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-05-13,I&#39;ve just watched it. It&#39;s an amazing movie! The fighting with magic is interesting! <br>I don&#39;t play D&amp;D but got totally drawn into the story line. There should be next sequels.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-23,"This was exactly the tone I was hoping this movie would go for.  Don&#39;t try to be the next Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, just give us a rocking fun adventure."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"&quot;we didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil ever known, but we are gonna fix it&quot; is like every dnd game ever"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-23,"This might not suck!  I think the light-hearted and humorous approach is definitely the way to go.  Has a bit of a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe to it, which is great."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-02,Such a great movie. I‚Äôd watch it again if I could.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"This trailer is FULL of D&amp;D spells, creatures, and locations straight out of the books.<br>It is full of Fan service. üòç<br>This is how Fan IPs should be made."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"WOW! It looks like they really did their research, using authentic source material instead of just generic fantasy creatures.<br>Black, white and red dragons, mimic, owlbear, displacer beast, a Red Wizard of Thay (as a Lich). Probably more that I‚Äôm missing. Can‚Äôt wait to see this!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"Chris Pine as a Bard is not something I knew I needed, but I welcome it with open arms"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-23,This movie actually exceeded my expectations. It&#39;s really fun
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"While I was hoping for a dark and gritty DnD movie, this campy and lighthearted take on things looks really fun. Kind of the drunken night of gaming with friends and rolling dice kind of movie. I can dig that."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"I was mildly interested in a D&amp;D Movie.<br><br>I am now VERY excited. This trailer is great. Good choice of character classes, love the monsters I recognise from the monster manuals I read as a kid, making it a heist sounds AWESOME and very appropriate. The tone seems appropriate too. Can&#39;t wait."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"Never expected a Led Zeppelin fueled D&amp;D trailer, but I‚Äôm here for it."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-27,"Loved the movie , the landscapes , the action , the comedy and the characters , really really great"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-12-28,"For the real D&amp;D experience, the druid says &quot;Can I turn into an Owlbear, PLEASE!?!?&quot; and the dm goes &quot;Oh, alright, fine.&quot;"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-03-06,"The conversation between the bard and the druid is ripped straight from a D&amp;D session, and has convinced me to see this movie"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiMinixSXII&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> I gotta say, jumping into a gelatinous cube in order to avoid getting murdered by a displacer beast is kinda genius.<br>Like yes, a gelatinous cube will still kill ya, but at least you bought yourself some time.<br>200 IQ plays right there."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2024-12-16,This movie needs a sequel!
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-02,"When the trailer highlights Black dragons with acid breath, mimic&#39;s,  druid proper shapeshifting into owlbears, gelatinous cube, displacer beasts, Magic that is clearly known and recognizable spells, this,  this is gooooood."

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"it may be the accurate monster design, the party wanting to go over the plan in a tavern or simply the campaign accurate looking story, this movie looks phenomenal and as a D&amp;D fan I am so excited."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-02,"Dad &amp; I were looking for a movie to watch, saw this on showcase and thought ‚Äúhuh, they made a DnD movie? Sure, why not.‚Äù<br><br><br>One of the <b>BEST</b> fantasy game movies I‚Äôve ever been to!! I have SUPER high hopes for a sequel in the form of another campaign!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,I can&#39;t help but be giddy when seeing all the creatures looking so real. It warms the old D&amp;D heart so very much.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"As someone who played a bard that was the leader of a group of thieves during a 3 year campaign, I heartily approve."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-12-09,I hope someone says &quot;that&#39;s like a 1 in 20 chance of happening&quot; when something lucky happens. That&#39;ll be fucking awesome
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"Okay, this does look your typical D&amp;D adventure and.... that means they did their homework, I guess! Y&#39;know what? I&#39;m down for it!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,The ending with Pine strumming the lute was worth watching the whole trailer
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-08,"This actually looks fun, let&#39;s hope there&#39;s a scene where one of the main characters randomly murders a villager without reason and it&#39;s never tied into the plot whatsoever."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-05-13,Did not expect this movie to be as fun as it was..Definitely one of my favorite films of the year!
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,This actually looks cool. Chris Pine is a cool guy.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-24,"Chris Pine and Michelle Rodrigez is not a duo I thought I needed, but it makes so much sense! You can tell even from this trailer how good their dynamic is. Can&#39;t wait to see this film!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"Not gonna lie, seeing a Mimic made me shriek out in joy. Owlbear looks badass af. Also, this trailer has more to do with D&amp;D than the entire first movie from 2000."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-19,"I&#39;m so glad I watched the film without seeing a single trailer until now. I would have had some of the best parts spoiled for me. It made it that much more enjoyable! Not knowing the mimic or the owlbear was coming was a great surprise. I understand the need to market, but sadly it comes at the expense of some of the best parts of a film&#39;s impact."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"I&#39;m getting so many Guardians of the Galaxy vibes here, which is a great thing. The cast is outstanding, the monsters all look fantastic, and the tone that they&#39;re going for here is more of a silly adventure rather than a serious quest was definitely the right call. Looking forward to watching this nostalgic creation."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known, but we&#39;re going to fix it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well how do we pull that off?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh...&quot;<br><br>If every DnD campaign I&#39;ve ever been in counts as canon, then this is the most canonically accurate DnD movie I&#39;ve ever seen."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,I love how instead of trying to make a compelling drama about a game they made a fun movie with the established lore of the game. I also like the guardians of the galaxy vibe to it all. Looks great.<br><br>Edit: Thanks for the likes :)
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-13,I only went to this movie because my friend wanted to go.... But y&#39;all have no idea how much I loved it. Probably my favorite new movie in many years. I loved it so much.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"I honestly don&#39;t know what to expect from most movies these days, This looks a lot better than I had hoped for. What ever they were going for I just wanted it done well, this looks like it has been done pretty well."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,I love the tone that they&#39;re going for!!! So much fun!!! Not taking themselves too seriously
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,This literally looks and feels just like a D&amp;D game
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-05-03,"this movie was awesome, it&#39;s been a long time since we didn&#39;t have a well-balanced movie with nice special effects, emotional stories and well written humor"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-23,It‚Äôs awesome to see a good representation of a real D&amp;D campaign out there. People like my gf can‚Äôt quite grasp why d&amp;d is so fun and this movie literally screams out why it is so fun. In our heads it‚Äôs a movie and this is just awesome!!!
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,It would be really cool if they published something like a character sheet for each of the main characters since they&#39;re DND characters. That would be an awesome promotional move and also just really fun if you want to play one of the characters from the movie in your own game.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"100% down for this! The CGI looks great, story seems simple and fun and can tell Chris Pine was having fun with the role."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-07,This is truly one of the best fantasy movie out there. I&#39;ve watched it just now and a solid 10/10
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"This trailer makes me realize the crazy franchise potential DnD could have. It‚Äôs kinda like Marvel, there‚Äôs a whole slough of existing characters, spells, creatures, plotlines and more to draw inspiration from. Excited for this!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"There&#39;s a dragon, there&#39;s a bard. As a DM, it already makes me nervous."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"This...<br><br>This actually looks like D&amp;D<br><br>My hope are slim, but this trailer does give me hope üòÑ"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-08-16,"This film is very beautiful, it is funny and it is the one that succeeds best in the area where the vast majority of films fail: creativity. He manages to surprise the viewer with the unexpected way he reuses elements that he has previously clearly presented. In general, to thwart complex situations, for lack of ingenuity and imagination, authors decree things, project unknown elements into action...<br>For example in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; it was decreed that Superman would be more resistant to the effects of kryptonite in order to defeat Doomsday. In Spectre, it was decreed that Ernst Stavro Blofeld would take James Bond&#39;s watch for a trivial thing, which is completely inconsistent. We find this logic in all the blockbusters. This film is the one where this mistake is made the least. In it we see characters facing difficult situations and using inventive ways to solve them. That&#39;s why I consider it the most successful blockbuster. From a cinematographic point of view, I place it above all Marvel films, DC, the Matrix saga (my favorite cinematic project), Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter,... In short! The most serious, inventive cinematic work I&#39;ve seen so far and I&#39;m all the happier, because finally the legendary Dungeons &amp; Dragons saga is cinematically honored. Finally, a real nice cinematic surprise!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-08-23,It always great when you stumble across a movie you didn&#39;t know you were waiting your whole life for.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,I was expecting WAY worse. This looks pretty dope honestly.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"I honestly wasn&#39;t at all excited by this based on how the earlier films turned out, but after seeing the trailer ( i think i have watched it at least 10 times since last night), I am VERY EXCITED!!! Can&#39;t wait till March!!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-09-21,this film was straight baller. it was done so tastefully in a genre that&#39;s known only for being cheesy. this one harnessed the cheesiness and then made it into something nothing but entertaining.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"Since so many people keep on commenting the same thing:<br><br>Circle of the Moon Druids can become Owl Bears. With DM approval and it&#39;s quite commonly allowed. The reason it isn&#39;t is because it&#39;s classified as a Monstrosity. Where Druid&#39;s wildshape into beasts. The reason for the Monstrosity is because the Owl Bear was originally labeled as a creation from a mad wizard.   Yet cannon changed it as a natural creature. However, the label wasn&#39;t changed. Depending on your DM you either use the older origins or the one more accepted in modern canon. So Yes a druid can wildshape into an owlbear. <br><br> &quot;However, the oldest elves recalled that owlbears had been around for many millennia and a few fey claimed owlbears had always been found in the Feywild.[1] In fact, owlbears were brought into being by one of the creator races,[11] most likely the aearee&quot;. Their stat bloc is also very close to a strong Cave Bear with similarly low intelligence. <br><br>So the reason the Owl Bear isn&#39;t allowed is due to the lore that it was created by a wizard. Yet recent lore suggests that was a myth and not the case."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,I have personally been at fault for the summoning of 2 demon lords over the course of a single campaign. At this point I should get ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt mean to unleash the greatest evil the world has ever known‚Äù on a t shirt
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,Ok‚Ä¶.this looks a lot better than what I was expecting‚Ä¶.hopefully the DND movie does pretty well. Been a fan of dungeons  &amp; dragons since childhood so I think this could be fun to watch.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-12-19,Who wants a sequel of this DnD movie
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-22,"Very impressed - not only be the vibe I am getting from this trailer, but by the fact that they managed to pull me in without spoiling any of the plot. That&#39;s a bit of a lost art these days. Very much looking forward to this!"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-29,Actually looks like a real D&amp;D movie first time I&#39;ve been hype in a while for a trailer
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-24,"&quot;He also plays the lute.&quot;<br>Oh okay wait so the bard is the leader? Oh, okay, I think I understand what kind of party this is. This will be loads and loads of fun. I can&#39;t wait."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-21,"I&#39;m excited to check this film out. Making a D&amp;D movie seems like it could be really challenging, but the potential payoff is HUGE."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2023-04-24,"I saw the movie yesterday and I have to say, after a long time I saw a fantasy movie (the last one I saw was Eternals) that I truly enjoyed. The CGI was flawless, all characters were very likeable, no cringy dialogues and there was no boring segment"
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,IiMinixSXII,2022-07-26,We might FINALLY have a good DnD movie!<br>This actually looks and feels like the game experience! <br>The fact that we have a bard actually playing the face of the group instead of a backup joke character is just the cherry on top.<br>I WILL be seeing this on the big screen. üëç
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-08-02,What I always loved about these films is how he gives the evil people the chance to do the right thing and they never listen so they suffer the consequences.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,Seeing denzel and Dakota fanning back in a movie together tugs at the old heart strings! I loved man on fire.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,I&#39;m beyond grateful to see him back
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-07,"Never seen a movie character that‚Äôs as terrifyingly calm as Robert ,loved the movie"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,This is a must watch. Looking at Denzel and Dakota Fanning acting together almost 20 years after Man on Fire. I‚Äôm thrilled.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,Seeing Denzel and Dakota Fanning together gave me chills! Man on fire is one of my favorite movies.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"The way Denzel can go from the charming smile, a signature in his work, putting the audience at ease, then the intensity he shows in his expressions during action scenes, it is that sort of nuance in his acting that always makes his work and art so compelling. Setting the audience up for growth in the characters he is portraying, but leaving that an unpredictable journey to discover throughout the film."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-08,"It&#39;s rare to see movies like this these days. A simple plot, only a bit of action, and yet every minute builds the atmosphere and gets you emotionally involved. You want every villain to get what they deserve and Denzel is like made for this kind of movies. He never disappoints. You see him and you just know the movie is good."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"Even at 68, Denzel Washington make me believe he&#39;s actually doing all that stuff, such an amazing actor such a treat to watch."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,"Oh come on, this is one of those series that doesn&#39;t have to end. Denzel finding bad guys to punish will never get old."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"One of the greatest icons global cinema has ever produced. Denzel Washington is not an actor, he&#39;s a genre in himself"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2024-04-14,I remember seeing Man on Fire.. a movie that stays with you long after .. Denzel is the best actor ever !!!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve done things in my life, Nikolai. Things I‚Äôm not proud of. I swore to someone I loved very much I wouldn‚Äôt go back to being that person. But for you, I‚Äôm gonna make an exception.‚Äù<br><br>Probably my favorite quote from this franchise"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-07-23,"Denzel‚Äôs acting skills, his style of acting and expressions are all purely made for the art of cinema"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,Denzel is unparalleled in this role. Almost every movie he‚Äôs done his acting skills have been on another level. Eagerly waiting for this.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-09-22,"Man, Denzel is so good I could watch him walk up and down those stairs with his walking stick the whole movie and still give it 5stars."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,"My Dad would have become 68 this year just like Denzel Washington but he passed away just earlier this year. He was part of the German GSG9 and later on worked for the BND. We enjoyed watching the Equalizer movies, him explaining details and analysing the Movies with me will forever be a pleasant memory. I will keep watching in his legacy."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a level 3, if it goes to level 4, you will shit on yourself‚Äù what a lineüëèüèæ"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,"Denzel Washington is Robert McCall as Keanu Reaves is John Wick, 2 great actors that bring characters to life. Pure art."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-06,I cant help but smile every time Denzel and Dakota share a scene together. This is like their reunion movie. haha
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"Seeing Denzel, Washington smile is enough to bring a smile to anyone‚Äôs face. He is such a humble guy, and the world needs more people like him."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,We demand atleast 6 Parts Denzel! Give the people what they want.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"I didn&#39;t think a part 3 would even be done, but I&#39;m happy it&#39;s here!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2024-01-13,"Simple plot, great story telling, no sex, little bit of romance, beautiful cinematography, great actors. Definitely, one of the best movies I have ever watched on Netflix. üéâüéâüéâ 10/10. Denzel and Dakota, and  the whole cast were great! Italy is beautiful. Would love to visit someday!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,Denzel....the best actor ever.I wish equalizer  would never end.He is just too good
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"Yes, I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôre finally getting a third film. I love Denzel Washington, he‚Äôs amazing as the equalizer. Can‚Äôt wait"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,Denzel Washington never disappoints..
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-12-01,"The Equalizer is such a high impact movie. If three is Denzels last one, I feel they should continue the story line with the girl. She knows him better than anyone. Denzel as the equalizer puts so much passion into every scene,  it&#39;s hard to see it come to an end. Job well done!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"You cast Denzel in your film, you can do no wrong.<br>Loved the first two, and I&#39;m sure the third one will be no different."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,"I love Denzel. I don&#39;t care if the movie is so-so or the best-of-the-best, he&#39;s always good in his role. He&#39;s one of the few true &quot;movie stars&quot; that we have left. This movie looks awesome!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,Denzel never misses. One of the greatest actors of our time and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still working. Sometimes you just need a kickass good over evil movie and he makes the best.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-09-26,Denzel Washington is one of the Greats. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this movie.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ikl8vy4zs&amp;t=103"">01:43</a> This is such an Equalizer moment. The underestimation and Denzel casually explaining the harm hes about to do yo you. Love it!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,"Seeing Denzel beating the shit out of bad guys never gets old. He might have gotten bored doing the same thing again and again, but I am just grateful to see him 3 times in the same role and for the makers who succeeded in showing him with the same energy."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-02,He almost 70 and pulls out this performance. What an absolute legend
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-15,THOROUGHLY satisfying !!!    <br><br>Fuqua and Washington.   What a combination !!! <br><br>STILL rocking HARD after all these years !!!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,Man this guy has to be the best Damm actor Hollywood has ever given us. You could never get disappointed by any of his movies! Such a Hollywood legend
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-08-24,"The simplicity in his talk, his clothing, his action and his presence of mind make him one of the best actors till today. <br>It&#39;s nice to see him back. Love and respect, Denzel‚ù§"

The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,It‚Äôs hard to compete with John Wick when it comes to action movies but this is one of the few unfinished series that can. Denzel always delivers great work.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,I&#39;m really glad to see the Equalizer movie series to come full circle as a trilogy. The team of Washington and Fuqua is awesome!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ikl8vy4zs&amp;t=163"">2:43</a> &quot;do I look like a killer?&quot; The laughter tells you enough you need to know"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-11-21,"I am not a fan of violence in films like this - but these films are an exception. Psychologically, you LOVE to see him kicking these bullies&#39; asses. They deserve everything that comes their way. Denzel is so good. Excellent film."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-12,My fav line<br>&quot;Are you warning me?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m preparing you&quot;üòÇ

The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,Denzel is a master of his craft. Actors of his calibre don‚Äôt come around that often. Great to see him back
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,So good seeing Denzel and Dakota back in a movie together after all this time :)
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,&quot;Do I look like a killer&quot;üòÇ<br><br>Absolutely one of the most amazing actors in this generation!‚úåÔ∏è

The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-07-27,"If Denzel and Liam Neeson ever do an action film together,  I&#39;m throwing a party."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-19,I love Denzel I hope he NEVER stops making movies and making appearances the man&#39;s a great actor and an awesome role model!!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,Hands down one of the best series of our time. A few decades later it will be a classic.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-10,"I was addicted to the TV show in the 80&#39;s.  LOVE the Robin Hood story theme.  <br>Waited for DECADES for the movies to hopefully be made and NOT get screwed up.  And my wishes were granted!  <br>Mr. Washington did this character justice, as well as his nice demeanor he represented in the character.  <br>Like a poisonous flower........beautiful and benign, until you touch them.  <br>I can only hope there are at least 2 more Equalizers with Mr. Washington.  These are great movies."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-02,&quot;Are you warning me?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m preparing you.&quot; <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to see this! Denzel is always an amazing actor!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,Love Denzel and it‚Äôs great to have him back for this final equalizer movie. Can‚Äôt wait to see it!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-01,"The Equaliser movies have been some of the best ever written and produced for the big screen. Hats off to all involved. The only disappointment is this is the last one for Denzel. <br>He has brought composure to each one of these films and realism. I can watch them over and over and never get tired of them. I hope he reads the comments on here and reconsiders his decision. Whilst I understand these movies were only ever meant to be a trilogy, they are in a league of their own. Theres always room for one or two more, just to keep the fan base happy."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-08,"I just love Denzel Washington.<br><br>In &quot;Equalizer&quot; and &quot;Man On Fire&quot;, he&#39;s portrayed the type of &quot; Come hell or high waters&quot; for you type of character for the innocent and loved ones. A balance within an individual I wish to see more of within the people of every society.<br><br>I honestly can&#39;t wait to see Equalizer 3 hopefully in theaters. Just got to get my husband cought up with E1 and E2 first."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,I can‚Äôt describe what it means to me to see my favorite actor of all time in my own country for the last chapter of the equalizer. He might not be on the walk of fame in Hollywood but he is undoubtedly the most gifted actors of all. Full stop.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-07-23,"It makes my heart happy to see Dakota and Denzel back on screen together again! I decided to watch Man on Fire again today after a long time of having not watched it, and I forgot how good they were together on screen! Dakota was so good even back then. Kind of odd that she‚Äôs only shown here briefly. I hope her role is larger."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-08,I love the film and basically a story of a good man and empathizing with people who suffers under evil
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,Love these movies bc you never have to worry about Denzel facing any type of hardship in his fight against the bad dudes. Just straight stress free action
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-28,"In a world gone crazy, where criminality is rewarded, this movie will be a welcomed event!  Denzel Washington is simply amazing."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"Every story around Denzel is well written and produced. He is the greatest in this time and age. Man is more than an actor, he is an inspiration."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-09,"Had a free day and stumbled across a cinema where this was showing. Brilliant, just like the others, there&#39;s not many movies I&#39;d bother go to the cinema to watch but this was one of them. Great cast and execution."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,It&#39;s so cool to see Denzel and Dakota reunited in a movie after so many years. Definitely gonna watch.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-23,"That crossover with Dakota and Denzel was just like a sweet walk down memo lane, literally gave me feels on Man on Fire. You know if you know. What ab excellente touch. Really want to know her character in the movie"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"Me whenever a veteran actor does a hardcore action movie: Yeah, I&#39;m thinking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-08,I watched this last night. This movie is taking me like literally to Italy! The violent scenes were brutal yet justified.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,"I love Denzel.  And no, he doesn&#39;t look like a killer.  He looks like a man who wants to be left alone: the most dangerous kind of man in the world."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,‚Äú Do i look like a killer ‚Äú best dialogue delivered spot on after that smile ‚ù§ great to see in theatres.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,I love how the whole movie is built on the fact that he just wants to love &amp; protect people. &amp; Will do anything in his power not to see them harmed.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2024-04-20,"Watching this for Denzel and he&#39;s the perfect cast for this movie. His charm yet the availability for him to turn cold is great. The franchise is well executed, good ending with no BS! Absolutely love the choreography of the action scene, very precise, melodramatic and you could capture the kind of person the main character is by the action scene! Great watch doesn&#39;t disappoint!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-05-01,"Denzel&#39;s acting is a true marvel to behold. He effortlessly transitions from his charming smile, which instantly puts the audience at ease, to intense and powerful expressions during action scenes. It&#39;s the subtleties in his performances that make his work so captivating, as he sets the stage for character development while keeping the journey unpredictable for viewers to discover throughout the film. It&#39;s this kind of nuance that truly sets Denzel apart as an artist üëç"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,This is literally once in a life time right here for Denzel to do a 3rd one. This is going to be so good. He has never ever in his career did 3 installments of the same character for a series. Don&#39;t miss it.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"WOAH!!! 20 years later, Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington full circle after Man on Fire is nuts."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-07,"Okay, so I&#39;been a fan of Denzel and Dakota since I watched Man on Fire when I was 11 or 12 I guess, and I dont normally give movies a review, but this one is an exception. It was a masterpiece, the pacing was perfect, the execution of the story was beautiful. It made me cry at the end part for Collins(Dakota). I also loved the fact that this is Denzel and Dakota&#39;s reunion movie after 20 years."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,"Part 2 was so good. The dynamic with his neighbor on painting the mural. The almost non existent music score in the movie,lent to the seriousness of it."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,Denzel is such a poised and classy man. He just has this foreboding presence about him in his movies. I‚Äôm beyond excited for this
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,So glad to see Denzel back.  What a great actor.  A non-Hollywood clown.  He is everything what Hollywood used to be.  So glad he is doing well!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-10,That scene when denzel resting  that walking stick and giving that look to the bad guy as he rode off like &quot;you my next target boy&quot;
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,I love these movies. The scene from the first one in the diner where he knows the guy isn‚Äôt an electrician and takes out the lights. Chills ü•∂
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-27,I&#39;m so happy to see Denzel and Dakota working together again!!! Man on Fire is still one of my favorite movies and I love him in The Equalizer series!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,The Equalizer movies provide such a sweet fantasy of there actually being justice in the world.  Plus the movies are just well done.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-25,Sometime i wonder what will Hollywood would be without those few great actors like Mr Denzel .<br><br>Thank you Mr Denzel .
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,That mannerism &amp; the personality of Denzel Washington is Unmatched. Truly he&#39;s built for this role üëå.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,"See that&#39;s the thing, he doesn&#39;t actually look like a killer, makes it even more terrifying. Good to have Denzel back in this role for one final time, just like the John Wick series, the Equalizer is flawless in my opinion."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-08-07,"What I loved about these films is how he shows that evilness might look powerful on the outside, but they are actually weak in the core."
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-15,I just finish watching this movie.. I‚Äôm telling you I love it‚Ä¶ Denzel always never disappoint with his movies
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-26,Denzel is one of the greatest actors ever. And his action roles ain‚Äôt no joke.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,I&#39;m so glad this is the franchise he chose to do sequels for because he is simply amazing in this role
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-08-07,I love how there&#39;s at least one scene in each movie where he details the exact nature of the punishment he&#39;s about to inflict in medical detail. Chilling!
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-09-29,Denzel Washington is the best actor of all time. He carries a movie like no other. His talent crosses generations and continues to deliver extroidinary performances the likes that will go down in the history of the arts as a true legend. I applaud his magnificence.
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"That 9 second scene at the end was insane, might be the best Equalizer out of the 3 üî•"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-29,SO GREAT TO SEE DAKOTA AND DENZEL REUNITE! THANK YOU! &quot;Man on fire&quot; is one of the most amazing movies I have seen and it just warms my heart to see them again together &lt;3
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-04-25,"So awesome and nostalgic to see <b>Creasy</b> &amp; <b>Pita</b> back together again after almost two decades!!! Day 1, can&#39;t wait"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-10-08,"I usually don&#39;t comment on movie trailers but will do on this one! It&#39;s 10/10 üòçüòçüòç <br>The concept, acting skills, and all!"
The Equalizer 3,19ikl8vy4zs,2023-09-09,I love Denzel&#39;s nonchalant attitude in these films. His confidence is exactly the sort you need to pull off fighting off multiple people. Considering his age in the third instilment. It makes sense his defense comes as second nature.
The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-07,"It doesn&#39;t matter if the movie gets flopped, keep producing horror movies from the conjuring universe, because we love the horror genre."
The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-06,"They better give The Nun the respect she deserves this time. She‚Äôs the scariest thing to come out of The Conjuring universe she deserves a good, scary movie."

The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-06,Valak (The Nun) is still one of the best and haunting horror characters ever created into film. No matter what you thought about that first film minus her also being in The Conjuring movies you can&#39;t deny she&#39;s terrifying...
The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-06,This actually looks like it could be better than the first one

The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-06,"I really don‚Äôt think people know who Valak is. He is one of the devils most powerful demons, and I bet a lot of people didn‚Äôt know he is behind or has a part in almost every haunting in the Conjuring universe.

The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-07-07,"So far the trailer seems good, I hope this movie pulls a move like Annabelle where the sequel is better than its predecessor. The first Nun movie was kinda disappointing but I hope this makes up for it. This scene <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-oyCwaArU&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> is a cool horror take and at the same time pays homage to Conjuring 2. &quot;It&#39;s okay to be scared, I&#39;m scared too&quot; really brings depth to the movie."

The Nun II,QF-oyCwaArU,2023-08-20,"A lot of things are frightening, what‚Äôs makes such characters compelling to me is that they ask themselves ‚Äúam I too afraid to face such evil? or is my will to live stronger.‚Äù The fact that they fight despite such horror is what makes them, or any person, fictional or real, great."

The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2025-03-12,The Marvels - DISASTROUS box office
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-24,<b>&quot;you took everything from me&quot;</b> how many times do i have to hear this line in a movie
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,Iman is clearly just having the best time of her life right now and seeing her having fun throughout the movie is the biggest thing about it I‚Äôm looking forward to
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,Dar-Benn: ‚ÄúYou took everything from me.‚Äù<br>Carol: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know who you are.‚Äù
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2024-02-15,"Failure is not an option <br>Box office, hold my popcorn üòÇ"
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,The greatest super power of all time. Seeing light.
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,I like how Fury is still around and supporting heroes. He needs to stay as long as possible in mcu
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,It looks unchanged and I still love how Iman gives the most believable reaction to Goose eating people
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,I hope we get a badass fight sequence where they are purposely and strategically switching places with each other
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,The usual villain line: &quot;You took everything from me&quot; üòÇ
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,It&#39;s cool to see how Goose the Cat has really settled into his role and improved his comedic timing!!
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2024-07-11,Kevin Feige: &quot;I&#39;m Ruined! I have nothing left except Spider-Man&quot;
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2024-01-04,I saw this on a airplane and people still walked out
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,The swapping places when using their powers is a really unique concept. I hope the three of them learn to make good strategic use of it rather than it being dropped really early on in the movie.
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,I&#39;m excited to see more of Carol&#39;s personality in this movie. She was a blank slate for most of the first movie and we have only see bits and pieces of it in Endgame
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2025-03-09,"i love seeing these hollywood clowns in full clown makeup, it suits them perfectly"
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,having the line ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me to smile‚Äù after everyone telling brie to smile in the first captain marvel poster is everything
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,‚ÄúYou took everything from me.‚Äù said all the last enemies in Marvel movies‚Ä¶
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2025-03-19,Yo why is there tonnes of bots trying to overly praise this movie in the comments? <br><br>A movie can be bad you know? Get over it lmao
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-24,&quot;You took everything from me&quot; come on Marvels we&#39;ve heard that line already
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-12-22,"If you want  to see what people REALLY think about this film, add the Chrome extension to return the &#39;dislike&#39; statistics.  Very interesting."
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,"At the very least you will have to give this movie that it had fantastic trailers that make it look like they&#39;re addressing the big issues with the first movie, primarily by giving Brie actual charming characters to bounce off of. Easily the best parts of the first were when Carol was just hanging out with Fury, Talos, Maria and Monica. Sticking her with Monica and Kamala for the whole thing seems like it&#39;ll be a slam dunk. Plus DeCosta really seems to know what she&#39;s doing in this, easily the biggest advantage this has over the original"
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2024-03-09,Even the characters in the trailer are confused üòÖ
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,"I‚Äôm glad they finally established that Carol can absorb energy, it‚Äôs been kind of unclear until now"
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-23,Monica -&quot;i can see light&quot;.<br><br>Me - &quot;üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è me too&quot;.<br><br><br>For everyone in the comments. ‚ö†Ô∏è This is what people refer to as a joke.
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,This trailer looks absolutely way better than the first one the action and some interesting stuff. Can&#39;t wait to see it
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2025-01-14,"The second week drop of 80% for The Marvels is a key point because it shows almost no one wanted to watch the movie after opening weekend.<br>Even women weren&#39;t interested in The Marvels despite a female lead cast. Over 60% of The Marvels tickets were bought by men and the movie still flopped.<br>Many people predicted The Marvels would flop with Brie Larson no longer having her movie sandwiched between two big Avengers movies. Misleading information made audiences believe watching Captain Marvel was important before watching Avengers Endgame. Early test screenings for The Marvels proved disastrous and also showed the excuse of the writer&#39;s strike holds no water. <br>After Captain Marvel sold billions audiences should have been desperate to get movie tickets for The Marvels, but many seats were empty opening weekend.<br>The Marvels only pulled in $206 million global before quietly moving to streaming after the weak movie collapsed at the box office."
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-22,"You can just see that Iman Vellani is having the time of her life right now. Though I will say I thought the first trailer was better, this is still looking to be a really good movie. Also, people still don&#39;t seem to understand that Carol was severely brainwashed in her first movie to be an emotionless killing machine. The Kree literally gave her a full blood transfusion just to convince her she was a Kree warrior. In this movie she has reconnected with her human side."
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-25,I love how Carol went just üòÆ while Kamala is freaking out over Goose and Monica just gave up
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2025-03-11,Disney is shocked after Brie Larson gives the studio their biggest flop ever with The Marvels losing $237 million.<br>After setting a record low opening weekend for MCU The Marvels dropped a staggering 80% in the second week showing nobody wanted to see Brie Larson.<br>The Marvels is the lowest earning MCU movie of all time only making a laughable $206 million global.<br>Brie Larson is left speechless after less than 40% of women bought tickets to The Marvels. <br>After The Marvels flop questions are raised about Brie Larson&#39;s ability to attract an audience which is why Kevin Feige has plans for a Captain Marvel replacement.

The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2024-02-03,"Either the directors and the writers are the stupidest or they think of us, the audience stupider. Watching this movie was literally torture."
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,They&#39;re absolutly going Higher Further and FASTER* -Can&#39;t wait to see Kamala back in action. The joy she gets from being part of a team as she always dreamed of it&#39;s contagious.
The Marvels,wS_qbDztgVY,2023-07-21,"I hope they do it justice in this second movie, it looks more developed than the first one, I can&#39;t wait anymore!!"

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,Honestly love that it looks like they&#39;re not even taking themselves seriously at this point. Just looks like a really fun shark movie.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"Films like these should continue to exist. It&#39;s not suppose to be taken seriously, just a summer movie to appreciate the fictional world of summer movie blockbuster mindset. You go to these to escape everyday mundane life, and eat popcorn together. Plus, the staff that worked on this film get to test out there skills for later projects that will require a more serious tone in a non-mega film. It&#39;s important to &quot;Let loose&quot; from time to time."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-10-05,"I just watched this movie a few days ago, and I&#39;m not even gonna lie; I never thought I needed this much camp until this movie came out. This was the most stupid fun I&#39;ve ever had in a long time. It was so funny, action-packed, and fun, and I mean all of that in the stupidest, but best way possible. I loved every second of it. We really need more movies like this, movies that don&#39;t take themselves seriously, are stupid, and just an absolutely blast."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-10,"This movie sends an inspiring message to young children. One day when you grow up, if you work real hard, you too can kick a shark."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-12,Perfect example of how not every movie needs to be a masterpiece to enjoy. Cant wait to see this
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-10,I like the fact that we‚Äôre not only having megs but also more creatures in this

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,I never would have guessed there would be a sequel to this. They seem to be embracing the silliness and that is great.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-09-08,Deep blue sea from 1999 is best shark movie ever.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-17,"With every new film in this franchise the shark seems to get twice the size as the previous film. Ok, I see where this is going"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"I&#39;m genuinely surprised there&#39;s gonna be a 2nd film. Really does look like a fun movie at this point, excited to watch"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"To those that were not expecting a sequel, The Meg series is based on a book, just like Jaws and Jurassic Park are. Although not many people know that the first Jaws movie was based on a book by Peter Benchley. The Meg books, written by Steve Alten, have 8 sequels so far. The next one is called Meg: Purgatory, which should be released this year or next year. This one is based on &quot;The Trench&quot; which was published in 1999.<br><br>Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror (The Meg movie is based on this book) (Book released in 1997, movie released in 2018)<br><br>The Trench (Meg 2: The Trench is based on this book) (Book released in 1999, movie will be released this year)<br><br>Meg: Primal Waters (The next movie after this one will obviously be called Meg 3: Primal Waters) (Released in 2004)<br><br>Meg: Hell&#39;s Aquarium (Meg 4: Hell&#39;s Aquarium, what else would the movie be called?) (2009)<br><br>Meg: Origins (I doubt this one will be made into a movie, it is a prequel story about Jonas Taylor&#39;s first encounter with the megalodon a few years before the first book that led up to his alleged psychosis) (2011)<br><br>Meg: Nightstalkers (2016)<br><br>Meg: Generations (The most recent sequel for now) (2020)<br><br>Meg: Purgatory (????)"

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,I just love how they didn‚Äôt take everything seriously. But the CGI doesn‚Äôt look any bad at all. I‚Äôm ready for this!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-20,"Whoever made this trailer deserves some kind of lifetime achievement award. I have no illusions that the movie will be anything special, but they nailed it with the trailer, and I will be watching it over and over for a long time to come."

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-10,"Audiences don‚Äôt always need movies with deep meanings or complex characters. Sometimes they need a cool, summer blockbuster that doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously but is still fun to watch"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,I love how now they are approaching this as an action comedy this time. First was a happy accident but now this time we know what it‚Äôs going to be and it‚Äôs going to be the ride of the summer! ü§©
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-09-15,I think that after this movie Jason Statham will be able to breath in SPACE and swim inside a burning volcano :) lol
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"Jason Statham cresting a wave on a jetski with harpoons, ready to fight a shark, is exactly the energy that modern cinema needs. Pure kino."

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-12-12,Love the scene where Jason Statham fights the terrorists AND the Meg at the same time. That is Chuck Norris level
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"I say its 30% horror 70% comedy, and i&#39;m 100% here for it"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-14,I love Jason Statham&#39;s sense of humor. The way he looks and they way he talks/conducts himself are two totally different things I love it
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,There you&#39;ll find a GIANT MEGALODON SHARK! <br>I cannot wait!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-09-10,I didn‚Äôt know until I switched my tv on and saw the ad- naturally came to see the trailer. Good call doing another. Love it üôåüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"So excited, just a fun action packed shark film that doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. Exactly what I need!"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-14,This is taking itself about as seriously as the Fast &amp; Furious franchise.......And I&#39;m 1000%  here for it!üèäü¶à

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,These are the type of movies I&#39;ve missed for so long. I thought Meg was going to be a one off but I&#39;m ultra happy to see it get an over the top &quot;dumb&quot; sequel. I&#39;m all in!!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-10-22,i watched it and honestly I liked it more than i expected. It&#39;s what sharknado always should be.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,I loved &#39;The Meg&#39; and am looking forward to the sequel. I do hope there‚Äôs more beach carnage this time however.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-12,I am an old lady who loves big action movies. The soundtrack is going to sweep me along even through the outlandishness. Can hardly wait! ü¶à
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-12-07,"The resounding drums, triumphant brass, and sweeping strings of epic music inject movie trailers with a profoundly thrilling ambience. This style of bold, operatic composition brings an unmatched sense of grandeur. The full symphonic sound washes over you, instant goosebumps as that exhilarating melody unfurls. No words are needed to feel the mood - whether tensions simmering into war cries or heroes rising against the odds to turn the tide. The music amplifies the high stakes hinted onscreen into palpable excitement. These epic anthems punctuate trailers with exclamation points, ensuring the adventure ahead leaves an indelible impression whether it features clashing armies or character-driven drama. The marriage of epic music&#39;s unrelenting crescendo and carefully edited visuals forms a siren song, drawing us right into imagined new worlds brimming with action, emotion and spectacle. Who can resist such powerful musical storytelling, the ultimate appetizer promising grand purpose behind these tales? We have those ingenious sound composers to thank for trailers that spark such strong senses of destiny through their triumphant symphonic suites alone - our hearts quicken and imaginations ignite."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,Thank you Warner Bros. for bringing 3D back to your films! This looks like an insanely fun flick!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-20,I like how Jason can casualy leg press biggest shark that ever lived on earth. What a legend
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"What I find interesting is that the first movie was kind of going with the serious tone vide with a bit of over the top action, especially near the end. From the look of this trailer, they seem to have fully embraced the over the top part and craziness of the world they crafted, and exploiting every corner of it, leaving no stone unturned. And honestly, I&#39;M ALL IN FOR IT!"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2024-10-16,The end scene in the movie was when Statham went full Dharam Paa ji. Lifting a chopper blade to kill a Meg! Hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-19,I love that they&#39;re not taking this seriously and they&#39;re just going all out to make it as ridiculous as possible. I can&#39;t wait to watch it.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-10,I like that they already revealed most of the funny/unexpected kills in this trailer. I&#39;m looking forward to spending 1.5-2 hours to see these scenes again!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"They are going all out on this one. Three Megs, a giant octopus and other creatures. This movie is going to be a blast."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-10-01,"It was much better than I expected.<br>Honestly, I was so disappointed at first that Li bingbing wouldn‚Äôt be returning for the second movie. Also, I thought the idea of the dinosaurs being in the Meg was bad.<br>It actually turned out much better than I expected. It wasn‚Äôt scary but it was very intense and some funny moments as well. I think it‚Äôs almost as good as the first one if not, equal.<br>I rate it a 7/10."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-07-19,"Jason Statham never fails to entertain his audience with fun movies. You can count on his movies being somewhat corny, humorous, action-packed, not too vulgar, and no full frontal nudity."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"There&#39;s no way I&#39;m gonna miss this fantastic movie, this trailer looks like the movie is gonna be really fun like the 1st movie."

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,Out of all the crappy Shark Franchises that we&#39;ve had for a while The Meg Franchise has definitely been the best
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,That ‚Äúooh barracuda‚Äù is my favorite part in this trailer. They put music like this on a shark movie makes it even better. This movie is a genius and I mean it!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-18,Him driving the waterjet with a Katana had me rolling. This looks like it&#39;s going to be just a crazy action movie and I am 100% here for it.

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,They didn&#39;t take themselves too seriously in the first film and I loved it. They seem to take themselves even less seriously here and it really makes me want to see it. The humour/Statham/big prehistoric beast remix : impossible to refuse ! ^^
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"When the meg said &quot;It&#39;s megging time&quot; and started megging all over the place, I can&#39;t help but pump up my fist and started to cry, truly a masterpiece of a movie"

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-11,This was the best direction they could&#39;ve gone. The books these movies are based off of are super serious and mostly entertaining. This is just pure fun.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"I love these types of movies that don‚Äôt take themselves too seriously. The Meg reminded me of the Mummy with Brendan Fraser, tons of action and a lot of fun."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"This is exactly something I would‚Äôve watched on SYFYHD as a kid. Bringing back memories of getting hyped for sharknado, super-croc, sharktopus as a kid."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-09-14,this is exactly what i needed. the only thing i didn&#39;t like about the first movie was that there was plot and it wasn&#39;t JUST cool shark scenes. now it&#39;s JUST cool shark scenes.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,bringing back the era of fun movies!! they don‚Äôt have to be oscar worthy!! some movies can be just fun!!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-08-03,"I love movies like this. No serious lore, they just have fun with it."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"About 20 years ago a tweenage version of me wrote a letter to Steve Alten, the author of Meg, about how much I loved the books and couldn&#39;t wait for the next in the series. He wrote back! Sweet guy, excited about the first novel being turned into a movie! These were not what I was hoping for when 12 year old me got excited about that letter, but I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s found some late success with turning the books I loved into goofy action movies."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2024-06-06,This is how you make fun monster movies. The MonsterVerse could really learn a thing or two.
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,"With them pull-ups, Statham definitely stands a chance against 3 megs!"

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-09-13,"Can everyone just give these peeps some sympathy for the production of this film?! From what I remember, they only had a year or two for filming of this! WHO EXPECTS THE CGI TO BE ‚ÄúOUT OF THIS WORLD‚Äù BY ANNOYING CRITICS IN JUST A YEAR OR SLIGHTLY LONGER????????"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,"I knew this movie was in production, and I&#39;m happy to finally see the trailer. This is one of those movies you just have to experience in the theater, like the first one. Can&#39;t wait."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,I love the part where the meg can crush the bones of a full grown dinosaur into pieces but somehow can be stopped by human legs and core strength of 1 human üòÇ üòÇüòÇ

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2024-01-10,lol when the shark breaks through the glass and eats that woman there is no water flowing in Xd
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,Everyone hated the first one so much that they flocked to the cinemas to watch it on the big screen. And it became such a blockbuster that they&#39;re not going to stop making more of these. Look what you all have created. A monster. Literally üòÄ
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,I love the tone of these Meg movies. This one looks like it&#39;ll be even more fun than the first one. I&#39;m psyched to see that huge squid too.

Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-07-19,the reason why i love the meg movie over the other horror based shark movies was because of how light hearted it is. and i am thrilled to watch this one
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-08-15,"If you&#39;re still debating on whether or not you should see this movie, just go see it! It&#39;s two hours of ridiculous, over-the-top action and just all around fun. It&#39;s definitely not a serious movie but its plot is still more realistic than the last 4 Fast and Furious movies."
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-07-21,"Some movies aren&#39;t meant to be taken serious, sometimes it&#39;s all about the fun of the ride whilst watching it"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2024-02-20,Jason Statham&#39;s character Probably wasted precious few seconds that could save a life again
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-08,This looks absolutely ridiculous and I freaking LOVE it! Can&#39;t wait!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-07-30,"I love it when the shark sees Statham for the first time, slowly backs away and says &quot;We&#39;re going to need a bigger Meg&quot;. CHILLS!!!"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,If this had come out a year ago it would have given me goosebumps but now I can honestly say that I&#39;m all here for it!
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-10-07,"This movie is pure entertainment, it&#39;s really good and fun to watch. <br>Action is also top notch and very funny many times, in terms of plot, it&#39;s not meant to be taken seriously but the movie is 10/10"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-11,"As someone who has read the books before the movies, it&#39;s great to see Steve Alten&#39;s books turned into films!"
Meg 2: The Trench,dG91B3hHyY4,2023-05-09,I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting this but I really hope there‚Äôs a awesome fight sequence between 1 of the megs and that giant squid or octopus.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,Honored to support Patrick Wilson on his directorial debut! He‚Äôs such a wholesome person!
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-20,"Really awesome that they brought the main kid back, and we‚Äôre getting a continuation of the family‚Äôs story. It‚Äôs been 10 years since we got a direct sequel!!!!"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-27,The first two Insidious movies are horror masterpieces. They really do draw you in and make you pay close attention to the background.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-11,Just finished this over here in Malaysia. Enjoyed it alot and the ending made me shed a tear. As a long time Insidious fan this film is the perfect way to end the series
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,"When the red demon‚Äôs song started playing, I got chills."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-18,Can&#39;t WAIT for this!  And SO glad the original cast is back in full force!
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-08-16,The picture dalton painted of him and his dad at the end brought a tear to my eye ! Perfect description of a fathers love and willing to do whatever it takes to protect his seed.

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-20,Time to go back into the further!
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,"I&#39;m so happy this movie is nearly here... I love Patrick Wilson and I love that he&#39;s directing... he&#39;s been the lead in two of the most successful modern horror franchises, so I trust him to bring us top-quality scares and story. This looks amazing!!"
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-10,The horror series that actually has a story and thrill.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-25,It‚Äôs been 10 long years. We were left with such a big cliffhanger. I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre actually close to seeing the next part now. Please please PLEASE be as good as the first two ü§ûüò¨
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-20,"Dalton is a full-blown edgy cool art student now inspired by his &#39;coma&#39; visions, love the character development it makes sense for the saga and many real life artists"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-21,"The first two are my comfort movies. I watch them when I&#39;m happy, sad, anxious about a test, can&#39;t sleep, ill etc so happy we&#39;re getting another installment &lt;3"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-08-03,"Just saw this movie, and I was not disappointed. People complain that the movie focuses too much on dialogue, but dalton and Josh got their fucking memory wiped, so it‚Äôs good that they focus a lot on their trauma and confusion. Even then, they still manage to provide us with some scares and suspense. Amazing movie."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-20,"Excited to see Patrick Wilson&#39;s directorial debut!üòçReally cool to see the original cast coming back for this movie. it‚Äôs also the first R rated film in the insidious series, so glad to be back."

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-21,"I have never been more excited for anything in my life. This is a culmination of my childhood fear and my love for nostalgia. While simultaneously feeding my hunger for something new. Not a reboot, not a prequel, not a new version of an old thing but a genuinely new nostalgic fear."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-25,"Can&#39;t wait for the movie, Idk why but I think Patrick Wilson&#39;s horror movies are always fun to watch!"
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-11,This was filmed at my aunts neighbor‚Äôs house in New Jersey. The cast used my aunts basement as base camp. Cool to see it finally out!
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,The smile I had on my face the whole time. Man‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt believe it took 3-4 years for production. Plz let the wait be worth it

I can&#39;t wait to see how the story unfolds and what secrets lie behind the red door. The use of sound and music was particularly effective in creating an eerie and unsettling mood. Overall, a fantastic trailer that has me eagerly anticipating the release of the movie. Well done to the filmmakers!"
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-17,Everytime a new Insidiousüñ§movie came out me and my sister would always go see it in theatersüé¨
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-09,"Idk seeing this kid actor again as an all grown up makes me tear up a bit. They grow up so fast üò≠üò≠üíî I&#39;m glad they kept an original cast, i just love it how James Wan, Ryan Murphy , Mike Flanagan all work with their own team of actors"
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-06,I can‚Äôt believe It‚Äôs been 10 years since the last sequel came out. Time flew so fast right before my eyes! Insidious Chapter 1 and 2 will always be my favorite Horror Films. Including the Conjuring starring with Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson who plays the demonologist. I remember that I first saw the films when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now I am eighteen! Can‚Äôt wait to see the new Insidious movie this Thursday!! I hope It‚Äôs worth the time.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,The third movie that we really deserve
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-23,"Nice to see that all the actors are returning, especially the kids.  Usually, they never bring back the same actor who played the role of the kid."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-31,"Insidious with the original cast is one of the best films because they did the whole 10year gap, which made it all the more realistic and bridging the gap of the story so well is just amazing! Watched it last weekend and it was so worth the experience, unlike Flash.."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,"i‚Äôm making it known that as soon as Elise makes an appearance in the film, i‚Äôm going to SCREAM. so excited for this"
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-11,10 years later they finally figured out how to make a horror film sequel that is not a horror film at all. Great job. Well done.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-27,"Seeing the original cast back for this one gives me the hype for the first time for a horror movie. Especially seeing the kids grow up like Dalton, Foster and Kali <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQuOnYnr3Q&amp;t=103"">1:43</a> gave me goosebumps. Insidious was and still is my favorite horror movie that gives me my worst nightmare. I&#39;m so watching this in the cinema"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-11-10,"This movie and fantasy/paranormal horror series was the best horror movie series I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m glad that you guys decided to finally put a bow on it, my only complaint is that you should gave stretched another 13 minutes to flesh out the black roommates reaction to everything going on because that felt really rushed and awkward. Otherwise was an excellent movie and I really enjoyed it. I appreciate the fact that this crew was able to make such a unique and relatable horror series thats totally different than the usual horror formula that is in almost every mainstream horror movie. Well done."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-18,"So I have to wait 34 looooooong hours for the premiere?!?! It‚Äôs madness, I tell ya! üò©üòÇ On another note, I can‚Äôt wait for this movie to come out! I‚Äôve been a big fan of this franchise! üíØüíØüíØ"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-27,Can&#39;t wait for this mannnn. Its been so long. Took over 10 years to see the conclusion. Probably waited for the kid actor to grow up so he could act on his role üòÇ
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-30,"So excited to see this! I loved Insidious 1+ 2. Still some of the best, scariest sound effects / music in a horror film franchise imo."

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-06-22,"I watched conjuring 2 in the theater. My first time watching a horror film at the movies. In the past I would close my ears with my hand at scary points. But conjuring 2 was the first movie that I fought my fears and watched without my ears or eyes shut. It was just like trying to keep my eyes open on a roller coaster drop. Ever since then, I love it. Thank You James Wan."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-05-17,"I was 13 back in the day when INSIDIOUS came out.  Till this day its one of the best scary movies out there, i&#39;m so glad the original cast is back. The tiptoe song is still giving me goosebumps."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-11,"This movie was all over the place. No direct plot. A little bit of Josh‚Äôs dad, a little bit of the red face demon, a little bit of a frat kid throwing up, a little bit of elise, a little bit of a monster crawling up to josh in the mri machine, a little bit of the two ghost hunters, a little bit of lorraine, a little bit of foster. Left with so many questions."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,"OH MY GOD I‚Äôm completely hyped<br>Insidious happened to be the first horror movie I‚Äôve ever watched and is the reason I began to film my own horror shorts, so I am so incredibly excited for this to come out"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-24,YES! I always loved the Insidious movies and the real Dalton is back! I just wish they didn&#39;t include so many jump scares in the trailer. Now I&#39;d know when to cover my eyes.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,I cannot wait! Blumhouse always makes magic even if it&#39;s hilarious horror films. But another insidious is what I need this summer.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-06-09,"Finally a sequel to the first two films, and directed by star Patrick Wilson no less. Definitely looking forward to seeing this."

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-09-06,The movie focused on Dalton living his normal life but still had jumpscares almost every 5 minutes. Got me at the edge of my seat.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-20,OH HELL YA! I was pregnant when the first film started streaming. It terrified meüòÖ Cannot wait to watch this one with my now 11 year old ‚ù§‚ù§<br><br>It&#39;s great having people so close to the original in positions of power in production. It really means a lot that PW is directing this for the blumeverse. It shows how important the series and fanbase are to him and the rest of the cast-family.<br><br>I cannot believe how big Dalton is!!!üòÆ
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-03,"Insidious was the first and only movie to really scare me, saw it as a kid and had nightmares but was addicted to it. I can‚Äôt find new horror that scares me that same way I‚Äôm so excited for this."
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,I love the first 2 movies. LEGENDARY. It certainly filled into the horror genre. I can‚Äôt wait too see the lambert family once more
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-11,I&#39;m so glad it got a sequel. I watched the first two recently then went to the third one but realised the original cast weren&#39;t there so I didn&#39;t finish it. It&#39;s amazing they got the original Dalton too.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-06-15,"first 2 chapters of insidious have been my favourite since childhood, didn&#39;t know they are going to be back, can&#39;t waitüòç"

Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-07-17,This was so good in my opinion!! After me and my bf left we were still jumpy. It‚Äôs been a while since a scary movie has done that to us.
Insidious: The Red Door,ZuQuOnYnr3Q,2023-04-19,"I loved the first 3 so much, 2 is my personal favorite! The first 2 back to back makes the perfect double feature. Wasn‚Äôt impressed with The Last Key. I have no doubt though that this one will be AMAZING! Can‚Äôt wait for this trailer tomorrow!!!!!!"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-11-24,They‚Äôre definitely keeping Heard outta the trailer on purpose. She‚Äôs absolutely gonna be in the movie as an ‚Äúokie-doke‚Äù

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,I don‚Äôt want this to be Jason‚Äôs last time as Aquaman but it looks like it will be.  Thank you Zack Snyder for casting Jason in this amazing role üéâ
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,It&#39;s going to be interesting to see Aquaman and Orm becoming a team

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-22,"honestly i do not care if Heard is here or not. She did her role pretty well in he first Aquaman and to me, her performance made the movie fun too. Like can people just get their heads out of the who-did-what and just enjoy the movie? Its not like she‚Äôs the protagonist anyway! Aquaman is a good franchise so as long as it‚Äôs a good movie then‚Äî really, who cares? People are just pointing fingers trying to erase someone completely. I think it‚Äôs great that DC just minimized her screen time rather than deleting her out altogether cause idk but that feels too unnatural to watch and I‚Äôm not a fan of it either. She really isn‚Äôt much of a big deal so people should stop taking her seriously. Ppl are saying this is the last movie so fr can‚Äôt we just enjoy this one"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,Can&#39;t wait to see Mr.Patrick Wilson bring his horror skills to the fear of black manta.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,"Now I know where The Flash&#39;s budget went but seriously, &quot;Aquaman 2 and the Lost Kingdom&quot; looks incredible throughout Black Manta looks impressive, Arthur is still BADASS and Orm is cool but the best thing is that Atlantis looks beautiful and GOD (just like the first movie üíô) and I can&#39;t wait to see it in December üòÆ"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-18,"They killed off Amber&#39;s character, Aguaman should shine.  Can&#39;t wait to see it now."

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-29,"Aquaman movie both 1 n 2 are epitome of how a superhero movie should be..the storyline,  the cinematography,  the cgi,  powerful villians,  the action n adrenaline rush it gives is absolutely bang on.. DC isn&#39;t promoting or creating hype for this character it deserves more  accolades than wonder woman or superman movie"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,I think I saw Amber Heard 1 time in this entire trailer
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-10-18,Glad I didn&#39;t see this trailer in a theater. That scream when he built the bridge. Too much for me. I almost cried.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-30,The Visuals and the CGI of this movie is definitely worth watching in the THEATRE üî•üî•üî•
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,"Unlike the flash which had some good moments but overall tried to hard to please fans, this just looks like a blast, it knows what it is and just seems to have fun with itself while also delivering on the big spectacle action it promised us like the first one."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-11-27,No one is going to point out that the plot is literally the same thing as the last fast a furious movie?
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-30,I genuinely enjoyed it.<br><br>The visuals alone are worth seeing on the big screen.<br><br>The characters are likable.<br><br>The story has epic parts.<br><br>Feel like a 90&#39;s movie with modern graphics. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-11-25,"I think the American people already spoke about this film with a petition, that was passed as bots. Now we speak with our wallets. And not to mention, we‚Äôre sick of BAD WRITING not superhero fatigue. So again ignore if you must."

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-25,"The movie is awesome!‚ù§I watched today in IMAZ 3D Laser, and can&#39;t wait to watch it again in streaming. Love all the casts in the movie, and super happy to see Patrick Wilson getting a lot of scenes. He&#39;s fantastic! Hope this is NOT the last Aquaman!"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-20,I have no idea why people hate Amber so much. I watched this movie today and the movie was good and she was good there too. Isn&#39;t an actress job to act well? Why do people care so much of her personal life? She didn&#39;t commit any crime you know.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-23,Just saw the movie. The CGI is incredible in this movie!!! Love it ‚ù§

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-24,"it&#39;s actually quite good. Don&#39;t believe the many paid you tube &quot;critics&#39;&quot; The movie is very well made. It&#39;s worth your money to watch it. The Flash was also very good, but the paid YouTubers brought it down even before it could be shown üò¢"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-26,"From India I just watched it yesterday, the graphics are so cool‚ù§"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-12-27,"If they had recast Amber Heard, the way Warner Bros recast Johnny Depp as Grindelward, fans and audience turn out would have been far greater. I would have bought a ticket. Go woke go broke."

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-24,I congratulate you for directing a movie that will make you experience every emotion while watching it.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-21,Blue Beetle will still be the best DC movie of the year regardless.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-30,Excited to see Black Manta again
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-10-17,If amber heard is in it I‚Äôm giving it a miss I‚Äôm not going to see any movie that pays her a cent. I love Jason Mamoa been a fan since stargate Atlantis but I just can‚Äôt back any movie with her in it.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-27,"They tried to hide Amber here so it won&#39;t look like she&#39;s there, but when you watched the movie she was there from the beginning to end lmao, what a tricky move there Warner bros."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-10-14,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGc5Tzz19UY&amp;t=50"">0:50</a> I&#39;m gonna annihilate Aquaman and dismantle everything he holds Still. I&#39;m gonna assassinate his family.  And Ignite his Kingdom to Embers."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2024-01-07,"I went into this movie with low expectations because of the mixed reviews. So I expected it to not be good at all. And I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn‚Äôt bad at all in my opinion. Not the best movie ever, not amazing, but still pretty good. I still think the first Aquaman is better, but I still enjoyed this one"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,UGc5Tzz19UY,2023-09-20,The second Aquaman movie trailer is always dope. STRAIGHT UP üòéüòéüî•üî•üíØüíØüëçüëç
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Massive respect to DC for promoting the comics at the end - that‚Äôs gonna be great for the people who worked on those!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,The way they captured how terrifying his first transformation and assimilation into the suit was amazing and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise.<br><br>Edit: How do I mute the notifications for this comment or will it do it by itself
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,I like how his whole family watches him transform into Blue Beetle. It&#39;s actually one of the few moments you see superheroes and their families get involved. You don&#39;t see that a lot.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-09-03,Bro went from learning Karate in high school to a literal superhero
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-07,First DC movie in years where I am excited that his costume/armour looks accurate and realistic! Blue Beetle is a great character with a great back story that ties into a major plotline. I hope they do it as much justice as was done in Young Justice
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-06,I‚Äôm hoping this is DC‚Äôs beginning to branching out their superhero catalog in the movies. Blue Beetle has tons of potential
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-23,This whole movie is brimming with human energy and personality. Jaime‚Äôs family is an entire full character. I just love it.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I remember meeting Xolo back at a Comicon event in Knoxville, TN years ago - around the time where Cobra Kai was still pretty new and got to talk to him for a bit at his booth next to Zabka&#39;s. Such a nice down to earth kid and to see him in a major motion picture like this now makes my heart happy. Dude deserves the world with how nice and hard-working he is. Can&#39;t wait to see this!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Seeing them pay homage and reference to the history of the character, the accuracy of the suit, the CGI looks good and the fact that this looks like a good, fun, action-packed wholesome time - gives me hope."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Xolo is such a likable dude that even if the movie isn&#39;t anything groundbreaking, audiences will love him and wanna see more."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-01-20,Love Xolo on Cobra Kai; he killed it with Blue Beetle
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-08,The armor looks way comic accurate than I thought it would be. <br>Massive respect for that
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Big belly burger. That suit. That transition. Just everything!!! Whoever did props and costume for this deserves a raise
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Blue Beetle is the perfect example of a legacy character done right not afraid to update the lore while respecting what came before I will forever love this character and I love the Dan Garrett and Kord shutouts at the end there!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-23,"This movie made me feel like I was watching my first superhero blockbuster as a kid. It sounds like I‚Äôm exaggerating, but I hope it has more or less the same affect on you"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Never have I been so excited to see a DC live action film since Man of Steel. I first saw Blue Beetle during Young Justice, and I fell in love with the character ever since. Hopefully the movie does him justice."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-08,"This is the first DC movie I&#39;ve been excited for in a while. Xolo is such a great fit for Blue Beetle, I&#39;m so excited to see where he takes this character and where this team takes this story."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"No reason DC can‚Äôt make a static shock movie now, this looks great."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-10-01,"Sad that this movie was so good that it didn&#39;t make enough money at the box office and a lot of people missed out on going to see it, way better than the Flash even the special effects were on point and definitely better than the second Shazam"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"I didn&#39;t expect to see Blue Beetle would get a movie, he&#39;s one of my favorite DC characters. Now I can finally see him in live action"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"It&#39;s great that they&#39;re not just translating the awesome character Jaime is from the comics; but at the end of the trailer, they showed the suits of previous Blue Beetles. Dan Gerrat and Tedd Kord.<br>Glad they&#39;re paying tribute to the OG&#39;s."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"They got me with that intro. Thought they were going to make Jaime a crypto bro or something. Love that his family knows he&#39;s Blue Beetle from the beginning again, really wasn&#39;t a fan of when they changed that in the comics. His family being a part of his superhero life was one of the best parts of his original series."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-23,"This movie was so good. It was so much better than I thought it would be. Excellent movie. I cried 5 times, it‚Äôs very emotional so anyone who is reading this if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet then make sure to have tissues with you when watching it. It had lots of heart and a beautiful love and bond with family. I loved it so much"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Finally we&#39;re getting a legacy character like Jaime Reyes done justice on the big screen, the organic nanotech suit up was so fascinating to watch, and in the adaptation his family knows and supports his superhero life!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,Xolo was amazing in Cobra Kai. Seeing him in a DC movie as Blue Beetle is a match made in heaven.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"They did a great job showing how scary it was when he first transformed and became part of the suit, and I don&#39;t think anyone can argue with that."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-01-04,"I love whenever the family is in the adventure. I am so fed up with lonely super hero hiding their identity and being miserable all by themselves, or orphans against the world. Family, friends, support system, that&#39;s the kind of thing I like to see in movies."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"The family knowing from the beginning that he&#39;s a superhero, and being fully supportive and helping him, after a near horror experience of watching him transform for the first time is a breath of fresh air and wholesome! Loved it üíô"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"This costume looks incredible.  It&#39;s the first time in a long time where I don&#39;t see an actor in a suit pretending to be a superhero, I actually see the superhero.  Great job making the consume not just accurate but immersive!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-07,"DC&#39;s improving every day and I&#39;m loving Blue Beetle. This casting for the character is perfect, honestly."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2025-02-28,I remember transferring schools to get a longer summer vacation just to see this
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I love that they‚Äôre including previous Blue Beetles here, seeing Ted‚Äôs costume gives me hope for a Booster Gold appearance too"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-10,I love how comic accurate the armor is. Kudos to DC
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I love that in this adaptation, the family knows about Jaime&#39;s secret and is fully supportive of him to the point that they help him on the field. So good."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2025-01-29,"I watched the film back in 2023. It had bad words, Spanish &amp; awesome superhero attitude that combines energy, bugs &amp; humans together. Nice job!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-20,This honestly looks like one of the best realizations of a DC character in forever. Xolo is perfecting casting!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"The fact that one of my childhood super heros, who isn&#39;t a big-name hero, is getting their own movie is getting me pumped up"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,All the kids are going to love Blue Beetle
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-02-21,The love ‚ù§ I developed after watching this movie. Way way better than I thought it was gonna be. This movie even makes the cartoon character more attractive. Well done DC
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"The most realistic suit up scene so far in all marvel/dc movies. It&#39;s like an organic nanotech, which came from inside his body, hence burning/tearing off his clothing instead of just covering it up"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I haven&#39;t read the comics but I am a fan of Blue Beetle in the Young Justice animated series and this brought tears to my eyes. Especially Xolo as Jaime Reyes, I&#39;m hype. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-26,Really good movie. My son and I went to watch it today and loved it. One of the better DC movies in recent times.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,They made the suit look really good. This looks like the love child between Max Steel and Venom
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-14,"I found it amusing that Blue Beetles&#39; initial transition resembled a scene from a horror film. I also enjoyed how, later in the video, Blue Beetle&#39;s family helps him battle crime even though they are aware of his true identity. Nowadays, you hardly ever see that in superheroes. Hope Blue Beetles makes history from any other modern DC movies."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-05,"Finally a DC project I‚Äôm actually excited for. Loved Blue Beetle in Young Justice, super excited he‚Äôs getting his own movie"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-07-30,Who is here for Miguel Diaz üòÇüòÇ
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"This looks amazing. Just love the fact that this exists, Jaime Reyes&#39; Blue Beetle is such a cool character and deserves a movie."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-05-12,"I love how Reyes‚Äôs family is along side him even trying their can to help him, unlike other hero‚Äôs hiding their identity"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-11-25,Why are everyone hating on this movie??? It‚Äôs not a bad movie at all I thought It was amazing and it‚Äôs one of my favorite movies
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,I love how Jaime isn&#39;t trying to hide his identity as Blue Beetle and everyone knew about him being Blue Beetle from the start. This is a great change from the typical teen superhero movies where the main character would hide his identity as a superhero from his close ones.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,This actually looks like a very wholesome family-centered movie. I can&#39;t wait to see how the protagonist gets closer with his family!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-15,As a huge Jaime Reyes fan I am so happy that DC is finally making a movie about him! I‚Äôve always thought he was way underrated and seeing him getting the attention he actually deserved makes me so excited to see the movie! Can‚Äôt wait!!!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-08-16,Today is the one year anniversary of the release of the film. Thank you for all the wonderful experieces and friendships I have fostered because of this  film. It&#39;s not Peak Cinema but it is my favourite. I can&#39;t wait for the Blue Beetle animated series coming up along with the Booster Gold show. Cheers to many more of Blue Beetle. üéâ Happy August 17th.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Xolo is a great actor. Glad to see him getting these bigger roles now
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,There&#39;s something so magic about seeing a beloved character come to life for the first time.  I got teary.  I love this character to death.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-12,"Who else remembers the animated Batman series with Blue Beetle ? This made me remember my nostalgic childhood, so many good cartoons and series."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-02-20,My kids and i loved this movie so much. We watch it on blu ray often.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"DC has so many cool characters outside of the Justice League, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re doing this."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I absolutely love the costume design. This looks really good. I&#39;m excited to see more. Also, awesome shout out to FF-7 with the Buster Sword!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-11-19,I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie was. The Latin element was very refreshing.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-06,I liked the part when the family wins the race against the badguys in their beetleminivan and them Dom shows up and congratulates them on understanding the importance of family.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"As a Young Justice fan, which Blue Beetle played a big part of in season 2, I can honestly say this looks absolutely FIRE! The suit and effects are perfect. And great song choice in ‚ÄúI Just Wanna Rock‚Äù for the trailer. Hopefully this is a hit for DC. üî•"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-10-09,"My boy Xolo doing big things out here! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else you do, you were always one of the better actors in cobra Kai and this movie proved why üôèüèº"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3_72Gb-bI&amp;t=137"">2:17</a> He can create anything so he creates the buster sword üòÇ love it"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-27,its just rare to see a super hero movie that your family knows your true identity and supports you doing it. I just love this kind of concept‚ô•Ô∏è
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Every moment I see Blue Beetle in this he looks absolutely amazing and the casting for Jaime is perfect
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2025-01-23,I&#39;m really amazed at how the grandma used the machine to defend the relatives.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-05-20,blue beetle is such a fun character!! glad he‚Äôs finally on the big screen‚Äîhope more people will appreciate our boy
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-07,Dudes a great actor and I&#39;m totally proud of how far he&#39;s come. Much deserved . They couldn&#39;t have made this movie without him . It&#39;s gonna be great.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-06,"Loved that he pulled out a Buster Sword at the end, haha! Xolo&#39;s the perfect choice as the Blue Beetle!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-02-19,"Bro Blue Beetle first appeared in 1939 and Iron Man appeared in 1963, to all of the haters saying he‚Äôs a knock off Iron Man, Blue Beetle deserved way more respect than it did, DC was late at pushing him."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,Never thought xolo would get this big of a role props to him üëèüèæ
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,The fact that the suit has practical effects makes this 10 times better. I‚Äôm in.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Love Blue Beetle from Young Justice. I think the suit is iconic, I wished the voice of the scarab was like YJ but I can&#39;t wait to see what the team brings to the film."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-12-27,Just saw it for the first time and I can say it‚Äôs one of the best superhero movies . üíØüî•‚ù§Ô∏è Definitely picking up a physical copy !
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"Words can‚Äôt describe how proud I am of Xolo from Cobra Kai to getting his dream role as Blue Beetle, super excited and pumped for this movie!! üíôüî•‚ú®"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-10,Blue Beetle is such an underappreciated comic character and is honestly the hero DC needs to save their cinematic universe from its decline. DC needs a relatable superhero to the youth and Robin just doesn&#39;t cut it. I really hope they nail Blue Beetle so people can better ease into the movies without it feeling awkward like they&#39;re supposed to know all these characters.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-17,"Just from this trailer alone, I find it hard to believe that this was originally going to be released straight to HBO Max. It definitely deserves for a theater release, thank you Warner Bros for doing the right thing for this movie"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2024-12-19,I never could get into Blue Beetle but this movie was definitely the best in the DCU imo. And that speaks a lot.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,This looks AWESOME. The scarab burning off his clothes looked so realistic and cool. I am STOKED for this.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-08,I&#39;m glad Xolo is moving on to other projects. I like him in cobra kai and I always think its sad when someone plays a character you like on a show and you never see them again in anything else. I hope he keeps working and does good things in his future.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-09,"So glad Blue Beetle is getting a movie, he‚Äôs to underrated of a character."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-28,"Surprisingly good, more people need to see it. The best film DC have put out (not counting any Batman films obviously)"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-05,I will never forget seeing Blue Beetle for the first time ever in &quot;Batman Brave &amp; the Bold&quot;. I thought he was so cool and always enjoyed his story arc in anything. I was surprised to see him in &quot;Young Justice&quot; as well. And then when he popped up in Injustice 2 and I was estatic. And now his own movie?? Let&#39;s goooo they better do it justice
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"The opening shot itself sold me. The chemistry between these two siblings, the whole family dynamics is gonna be fantastic, in addition to Jaime/suit dynamic and effortlessly smooth nanotech. And, Xolo looks the part."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Now this actually looks like alot of fun hopefully unlike Shazam 2 people will give this Movie a chance
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-09-13,I saw the movie in theatres a couple of weeks ago and it was a really fun DC movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. I loved every second of it and I loved the exploration on the power of family dynamic.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,I love how open the community is to the changes on how blue beetle is being portrayed
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"Love how his first instinct when he was told he could make anything is to make a final fantasy looking sword lol, love the Vibe of this movie so much"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"The whole time I was watching this trailer, I just kept quietly saying, &quot;Please don&#39;t be awful, please don&#39;t be awful, please don&#39;t be awful.&quot; Surprisingly enough, it looks badass! Xolo Maridue√±a is an incredible actor, playing an incredibly underrated superhero. Kid has got some amazing talent, and I can&#39;t wait for this movie. Also love that they show how terrifying the Scarab Armour attaching to a host is, and all of his family members&#39; reactions are spot on!"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-31,"‚ÄúBatmans a fashist‚Äù idk how to spell that but that was hilarious, I honestly think this movie is gonna be amazing"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I love that in this adaptation, the family knows about Jaim&#39;s secret and his fully supportive of him to the point that they help him on the field. So good."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"I love the emphasis DC is putting on highlighting the comics that they&#39;re being inspired by, seeing &quot;Read where it all began&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3_72Gb-bI&amp;t=164"">2:44</a> make me so happy"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3_72Gb-bI&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> Seeing The Bug and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3_72Gb-bI&amp;t=154"">2:34</a> the Dan Garret &amp; Ted Cord costumes are incredible. I love the casting for this movie. This is definitely on my must-see list for 2023."
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-08-23,just seen blue beetle in theaters and I thought it was an amazing film! Loved the whole family dynamic and think it was a great story. Everything looked super cool as well. Definitely think it‚Äôs one of the best movies of the year. (And maybe even my favorite DC movie)
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,Who else is ready to witness the rise of the Blue Beetle ? <br>Can‚Äôt wait to see this on the big screen with my fellow superhero fans.
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-04,"I love how Jaime created a giant sword, gives off berserk and power rangers and final fantasy vibes. I‚Äôm buying tickets for opening night"
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-03,I&#39;ve been waiting for a Blue Beetle movie for so long!! And I&#39;m so glad the Xolo was cast as Jaime Reyes!! HE&#39;S PERFECT!!
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2025-02-26,When I saw big belly burger I legit was thinking the flash
Blue Beetle,vS3_72Gb-bI,2023-04-14,the way this looks like it could actually compete with a marvel movie gives me so much hope for this movie
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"I love the twisting halls, stretching walls, and disappearing windows. The mansion is only sturdy when it wants to be."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"If Disney can pull off a scary movie, that would be really something worth celebrating"

Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-25,I love how we have a comedy version of the haunted mansion in the 2003 film and now a more scarier one. This is exactly how Goff and Anderson wanted the attraction to be like. Scary but also comedic.
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-07,I&#39;ve been obsessed with the Haunted Mansion for years. The way they&#39;ve brought the characters to life in this film looks amazing. I&#39;m ready to take the ride!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"This is what Disney needs nowadays. Instead of cashing in on those unnecessary live action remakes that&#39;s getting stale, make a new story, in this case based on their theme park rides into movies. Even if it doesn&#39;t work, i still apprciate their effort in trying something new. Just like Tomorrowland which was a pretty underrated movie and prefer to watch that over the Disney remakes"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,This is how you do a reboot. Looks awesome. Danny is just Frank and I love it
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"As somebody who loves the theme park ride, I‚Äôm really interested in this."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-28,If this movie can re create the terror waiting in line for 3 hours to ride the mansion then I‚Äôm in. Nothing is more terrifying üëª
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-21,Finally the hatbox ghost gets the part of the movie! This is awsome!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Even though the 2003 Eddie Murphy version does hold a special place in my heart, I <i>can‚Äôt</i> deny that this looks MIGHTY interesting (üëç)!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Finally, a revive old character from the old version of the ride <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLKTz81bj8&amp;t=80"">1:20</a>"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,Definitely gonna be watching
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-10-08,"I just watched this movie and it was perfect. Laughed, cried, smiled, and almost fell off my bed a few times with my big jump scared self.. I was at Disneyland the year it opened, yes that old, I love the honor this movie bestowed on the ride itself.  I am in the ticket line if they make another."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-30,"I love how they are including the hatbox ghost, given that he wasn&#39;t part of the ride for very long."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"They‚Äôre really respecting the ride it seems, definitely gonna be watching"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Second trailer and it&#39;s looking even better. love that it&#39;s sticking to a very creepy feel and seems to reduce the humor quite a bit. Was very uncertain originally, but now I&#39;m all in on this."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"So long as Raven Symone sings about superstition, I&#39;m all in."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-30,Love that the Hatbox Ghost is in this! Marc Davis would be proud :)
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-21,So going to see it. IT HAS DANNY DEVITO AND THE HATBOX GHOST IN IT! What&#39;s not to like?
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,I&#39;M EXCITED FOR JAMIE LEE CURTIS!!!!!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of a couple of ghost‚Äù last famous words, ladies and gentlemen"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,That police sketch gag was perfect. üòÇ<br><br>This actually looks pretty good!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-13,The hat box ghost look so amazing!! And Jared Leto‚Äôs voice acting is surprisingly well done
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-08-08,"They went with a VERY different route from the 2003 The Haunted Mansion movie, which is good. Finally NOT a remake, but a complete re-imagining."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,So excited for this movie!! I loved the original with Eddie Murphy!!! Can&#39;t wait to see what this one gives!!!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"One, Rosario Dawson‚Äôs character being named Gabbie and spelled that way has me soooo happy. Two, Captain Gore hint at the end as me SCREAMING. Three, the Hat Box ghost looks amazing.  Four, it seems like this plot is exactly like what the predicted lord of the Hatbox Ghost and Constance Hatchaway had been implying. That he was her accomplice/secret lover who helped her with her killing"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Now this looks legit. Reminder of how good that first Pirates movie was and still hold up today. LaKeith, yes please, loved him in The Harder They Fall."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-18,"I remember being terrified of this ride as a kid. Now that I&#39;ve gotten older with an obsession of movies, this will be a fun and interesting way to experience the ride!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-20,"I am glad to see the Hatbox Ghost in here. He is my absolute favorite out of all 999 grim, grinning ghosts in the mansion."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,This actually looks pretty scary for a Disney movie
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,the cast looks great. it&#39;s been a minute since i&#39;ve been this interested in a live disney project
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of a couple ghosts‚Äù That‚Äôs what every first timer for the theme park ride thought. Now it‚Äôs all thrills, chills, and spills! üòÇ"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-22,This needs award for most kid friendly movie of the year
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-15,Danny Devito is a treasure.
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"As long as this movie has the singing busts from the ride, I‚Äôd watch this movie."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,Can we be impressed by that sketch artist for 10 sec?
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,"the Haunted Mansion is my all time favorite Disney ride, this looks really promising! Loved seeing Madame Leota, Hitchhiking ghosts, Constance Hatchaway and the Hatbox ghost!! ü´∂ü´∂"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-09,I&#39;m glad the Hatbox Ghost is going to be included in this. He&#39;s my favorite ghost from the Haunted Mansion. ‚ù§üëªüé©
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-06,It&#39;s so cool to see the inspiration they&#39;ve taken from the first film (an underrated classic) and the ride! Consider me hyped ‚ù§Ô∏è
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"This is so exciting and can‚Äôt wait for Disney to do an original Live-Action film outside of the Live-Action remakes moreso one based on their theme park attractions, along with the fact that Disney is doing another Haunted Mansion film that stays true to the original theme park ride source material."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,LaKeith has to be the coolest actor in Hollywood.
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,The Hat Box Ghost looks magnificent in this. I&#39;m giving this movie a chance.
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-28,"Glad you decided to get those grim, grinning ghosts in the trailer.   The movie feels so much like the ride.  And the decision to avoid<br>outdated horror movie tropes like Steven King&#39;s The Shining and the Exorcist, just brilliant! After watching this trailer, I&#39;m convinced all Disney-philes and children will flock to this movie!  Kudos, standing ovation!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-12,I hope the ballroom scene is in the movie. I love how they added the creepy portraits....the ones you see when you first go into the HM. Can&#39;t wait to see this!!
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Loving this! And it seems like the Hatbox Ghost has a big role to play. Not just a cameo, which is a big win for me. He is my favorite of the ghost at the mansion :)."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,"Didn&#39;t mind the Eddie Murphy version <br>But I do LOVE how U get THIS creative with a reboot like <b>Pirates of the Carribbean, Prince of Persia, John Carter, The Lone Ranger, Tomorrow Land, Jungle Cruise</b><br><br>Especially when it&#39;s a group of people instead of a family of four"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,"Laughed out loud at that end joke. When he turned that sketch around LOL. And the lead up, they played the whole joke out. So good."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-19,"July 28th, can‚Äôt come quick enough. Loved The Haunted Mansion from ‚Äò03, this is next level."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-02,"It&#39;s very rare I will click thumbs up to anything Disney lately, but I am beyond excited to see this!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,Absolutely 100% after seeing this trailer Should be pushed back to late September or early October theres a lot of good movies in July probably the scary ethic would work nicely that time of year
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Okay I&#39;m really digging this! The house is so haunted that it&#39;s become an entity itswelf and it wants to trap more people inside. Also kudos to Devito for rocking it even at his age, the guy truly loves his craft"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"The movie itself looks wonderful. The trailer is even better than the previous one! Plus the music is top notch!<br><br>SPANISH:<br>La pel√≠cula en s√≠ se ve maravillosa. ¬°El tr√°iler es incluso mejor que el anterior! Adem√°s, ¬°la m√∫sica es de primera!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-08-17,LaKeith Stanfield was AWESOME!!! He&#39;s one of my favorite actors out right now. The man has swag and range. Loved the movie!!! A Halloween classic for sure.
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-23,The fact that this looks scarier than the FNAF movie is insane

Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,This is gonna be so good I‚Äôll be sitting in my car that has the purple haunted mansion print seat and steering wheel covers till then üòÇ
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,One of my favourite rides of Disneyland Paris is the Phantom Manor. <br>I love that they took so many references from the ride üîÆ‚ú®
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-22,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLKTz81bj8&amp;t=105"">1:45</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLKTz81bj8&amp;t=131"">2:11</a> that part alone has me considering watching this movie when it comes out."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-06-28,What would really make the movie authentic would be for it to break down at the half way point and tell us to remain seated our doomed seats.   (Extra credit to say it in multiple languages)
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"Looks like a lot of fun! The ghost FX and style is a lot better than most of the genre films in the past decade or more, so that&#39;s reassuring to see."
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,I‚Äôve been riding the haunted mansion for 25 years since I was a little kid and now it‚Äôs finally coming back in o theaters again .
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,"After watching this trailer, I am hooked on this film üé• this film is a comedy, horror film and it looks like this will do well what do you think!??!"
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-07-01,People thinking Disney never made a Scary movie before. <br><br><br>Me: remembers the movie ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT LOOK UNDER YOUR BED‚Äù üò≠üíÄ
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,&quot;from the studio that brought you Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;...Is it normal that I&#39;m more excited for that than for the actual movie?üòÖ
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-16,OK THIS ACTUALLY JUST MADE MY DAY THIS REBOOT LOOKS AMAZING WELL DONE DISNEY
Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,"&quot;God, give us a break. There&#39;s so many bad people in the world, haunt them.&quot;"

Haunted Mansion,AjLKTz81bj8,2023-05-17,This cast is unreal! &amp; I love to see Owen Wilson in another haunted house movie! The Haunting was an underrated late 90s horror classic lol

Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-01-09,Jesse Plemons is one of the most under rated actors. <br>He always holds his weight with the lead actors &amp; steals the scenes.

Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-04-06,Whoever made this trailer should make all the trailers
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-01-15,Something about that simple line ‚ÄúMy color‚Äù I just love it! Her delivery and the simplicity of the line but it means so much.
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-07-27,"Jesse plemons stole the scene every time he was in it, he&#39;s an incredible actor and becoming one of my favourites. he not only acts phenomenally, he also has the ability to bring you in more and give you double by making it even more entertaining. sublime"
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-02-09,This movie is unbelievable. I‚Äôm still mesmerized by it. That‚Äôs how deep this movie is. I‚Äôd advise anyone to see it. I‚Äôve seen it twice now and even bought the book by David Grann. It‚Äôs a true masterpiece. The movie is so authentic and real it‚Äôs almost as if you were there transported to that period. I‚Äôm mesmerized.
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-01-07,"I remember when I learned about the true historical events behind this film. Every person in their lives betrayed and exploited them. Every white person. It was disgusting. I can&#39;t believe they don&#39;t make us learn about it in schools, along with Tulsa. I&#39;m very glad it&#39;s being talked about now because of this film."
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-03-22,Lily was really really good. Definitely deserved best actress imo

Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2023-12-28,"This is a well directed and detailed movie. I watched all of its almost 3.5 hours and didn&#39;t get bored even though the motive &amp; agenda in the plot was clear from the beginning.<br><br>A minor spoiler alert: I don&#39;t know why, but I particularly like the ending of it as I was born in the 80s &amp; grew up seeing my mother listen to radio stories. It evoked memories &amp; was interesting seeing how those stories were produced."
Killers of the Flower Moon,EP34Yoxs3FQ,2024-03-24,"Extremely sad movie. I got so much involved emotionally. De Niro, Di Caprio and Lily Gladstone really know how to act.<br>Mr. Scorsese, thank you for this masterpiece. 2023 was such a rich year for movies, and the Oscars were a tough battle. I think De Niro deserved Best Supporting Actor."

Three &amp; 1/2 hrs felt like 2, if that.   The Osage Indians had a good deal of input into the making of the movie &amp; depicting it with  historical accuracy.  And I agree, DiCaprio was amazing &amp; I found it hard to believe he was the main character.  The corruption of the human state of being is So so so sad."

Sandwiched in between De Niro and DiCaprio, his scenes weren‚Äôt the smoothest. But he did alright for being a musician.

Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-03-28,This is 100% a movie I&#39;m not too sure the kids will survive... but honestly we need a movie that will shock and surprise us out of that clich√© once in a bloody moon
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-20,Whoever plays the mother looks like she does a fantastic job!!! I mean all of them but that part where she‚Äôs outside the door and says ‚ÄúOpen up now‚Äù is great‚Ä¶WOW
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-11-30,See? Evil Dead series never disappoints. All we ever need in a horror movie.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-05-22,"Do am I the only one who is obsessed with this trailer and movie? - I went to the cinema 2 weeks ago and, man... This is a work of art in horror field. 10/10! LET IT RISE!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,"I think Evil Dead is one of the only movie franchises that can actually pull off horror and gore at the same time, so many &quot;Horror movies&quot; now a days are just blood and gore with little horror in them, Evil Dead seems to be one of the only few franchises to actually achieve the horror part of their movies and I love them for that! Can&#39;t wait to see this"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-05,"The main thing I love about this is that it feels like The Evil Dead remake, it has the style and the creepiness and it&#39;s looks like it&#39;s gonna have the over the top badass gore that I loved from that remake, Fede Alvarez isn&#39;t even directing this and yet they find a way to make it feel like it&#39;s directed by him, cannot wait to see this!!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2025-01-05,One of the best horror movies I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm tired of horror movies with happy endings. This movie is always shrouded in mystery and never offers a solution. It only gets worse and worse. Highly recommended!
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-21,"After just seeing this movie in theaters I can confidently say this has to be by far the best horror movie I&#39;ve ever come across, It genuinely made my girl feel like she was about to have a panic attack. 10/10"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-06,I love the sheer look of terror on the characters faces as the voice is reciting the words from the necronomicon over the record.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,The Evil dead series never disappoints the audience. üëèüèº best of luck with fear &amp; trembling ü©∏üíâ
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-11-05,"This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a really really long time. Amazing cast, amazing special effects and very well written."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"I love how Evil Dead exists in two extremes, we got full blown Evil Dead 2 camp in Ash vs Evil Dead and full on horror/gore in the remake and this it seems. Looks awesome."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-06-04,"Saw it in theaters last night and it was the first Evil Dead movie I&#39;ve ever watched. It was absolutely incredible and was such a great movie-going experience. The cinematography, the dialogue, and the chilling music, were all done beautifully. Highly recommend! Looking forward to another one."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-05-29,"I love how the &quot;Deadites&quot; in the Evil Dead lore shift to their weeping, crying self just so everybody can get their guards down and/or feel worse than they already are about hurting them.<br><br>Simplest trick for psychological horror, but myGod it&#39;s brilliant."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-07-24,What makes it more scarier is the song in the bg !!! ü§êü§ê <br>It gives me shivers ü•∂
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,The cheese grater used as a defense weapon to a protagonist is a freaking smart move.. i felt my skin tighten to that clip.. cant wait to watch this.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,The delivery of the ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs with the maggots now‚Äù line was spot on. Hype.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,Love when a trailer manages to put my skepticism to rest. This looks absolutely brutal and a worthy successor to the 2013 remake
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-03-07,Masterful in every way . Special effects and great music are the main reason why I enjoyed watching this movie . Acting is beyond expectations . As a result you cannot get bored with this film . Definitely üíØ
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-02-01,Finally some relaxing and heart warming family movie üíïüíï
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-08,"the use of practical effects is so effective it‚Äôs what i loved about the 2013 movie and looks like they are going to do it similar in this one, evil dead are genuinely the only movies that can make me squirm! hopefully this one is as good as it looks!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-02-12,"I love how the way they do their roles from bottom of their heart to make audience feel thrilled. And I love how the way, girl opens the door with all her innocence and ask why she is not looking good, and secondly I love how the ghost says that mommy is maggots now it feels really horror"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-07-20,"Finally had the chance to watch this with my son last night and we both loved it! I absolutely love every movie in this series. Although Halloween is my all-time favorite, Evil Dead is a close 2nd. Hope they make more! Also- Ash vs. Evil Dead is such a fun show. I&#39;ve watched it through 3 times. Really wish they had been on a better network so there could have been a season 4 though."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-24,Now a genuine horror trailer after a long time. Had goosebumps during entire trailer duration. Can‚Äôt wait for the movie to hit theatres üëè üëè
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-21,"The trailer, alone, should win an award. Very well put together! The first trailer I&#39;ve seen that actually makes the anticipation of seeing the movie a whole lot better! Bravo!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"And they were gonna dump this on streaming?! This looks AWESOME! Good call going theatrical, can&#39;t wait to finally see Deadites in the cinema after 10 years!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-03-17,"I love how the deadite is portrayed in this movie.<br><br>Beyond the comical, they are absolutely merciless and completely devoid of any good."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"As a huge fan of the Originals and Bruce Campbell, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I love the comedy/ silliness of 2 and Army of Darkness. I also liked the more serious nature  of 1 and the remake. I gotta say this looks better than the 2013 remake. Which is exciting cause I like the remake. I&#39;m glad they went serious because not sure if anyone could pull off the one liners like Bruce does lol."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-18,Thank you for keeping the horror genre alive üôå
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-04,"The ‚Äú mommies with the maggots now ‚Äú was THE BEST line I‚Äôve heard, and how she delivered it was just perfect. I hope y‚Äôall pay her well."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-10-28,"What a good trailer, even after watching the movie 5 times, this still gets me hyped. Great editing."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-07,"So glad they keep making evil dead films, i hope they never stop"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-03-18,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smTK_AeAPHs&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> &quot;Mommy&#39;s with the maggots now&quot;<br><br>straight up most savage demon line i have heard"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-10,the scalping and the grater by themselves alone give this trailer a 10/10 i already know this is gonna be one stomach turning part in the series!
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-06-25,"I just finished watching the evil dead -2013 for the first time,  bone chilling horror movie.  Now i will watch this Today."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,"$12mil budget, this movie should pop massively. It looks so good, glad it got a theatrical release!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"This looks amazing, same vibes as 2013 remake. It‚Äôs going be super bloody."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-22,"I saw the movie today and this movie is no joke. Evil Dead Rise is far and away the best horror film I‚Äôve seen this year. This movie was awesome. It was disturbing, scary, brutal and the movie showed no mercy. The Evil Dead franchise continues to bat 1000 at the plate. Every film in the series is amazing. The original from 1981, the awesome Evil Dead 2 from 1987, Army Of Darkness was a change of pace it was a flat out comedy and yet it was still a blast. The 2013 reboot was so underrated and in my opinion one of the better reboots over the last decade. This series is perfection not one lousy movie or uninspired effort. Most horror movie franchises get lazy and don‚Äôt put their best foot forward at a certain point but that‚Äôs never happened with Evil Dead and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such a beloved horror franchise."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-04-26,Watced it in Cinema hall with two of my friends.  It was an amazing experience.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-27,This is probably one of the best horror films I&#39;ve ever seen. That&#39;s saying alot. It&#39;s also hands down the most gory that&#39;s for sure. Intense from start to finish. Alyssa Sutherland (the mom) was phenomonal. She is what really set this one apart from the rest. 10/10
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-27,"If you haven‚Äôt seen it, go see it in theaters. The sound production is the best I‚Äôve experienced in a movie theater. This movie is one wild ride! One for the books!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,"I laughed when the kid opened up the door getting grabbed, that&#39;s how you give kids trauma right there masterpiece üëå"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-09-09,"Just finished watching this qnd i gotta say that these comments gave me high expectations but it wasn‚Äôt all that,most of the scenes were predictable and the actors didn‚Äôt seem genuinely ‚Äúscared‚Äù .I give this movie a 5/10"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-08,&quot; Mummy&#39;s with the maggots now &quot; <br><br>Probably the most Evil Dead line there could ever be.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-13,The bloodied demonic face while she talks in her normal voice without any demonic growl sound effects is actually really scary. I&#39;m definitely giving this a shot
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-30,"Just saw this last week. The streak of every evil dead film being good continues. My brother said the film wasn‚Äôt scary, but I was terrified at times. I loved how intense the gore was and the acting was really good IMO. Plus the incantation through the speakers made my skin crawl. I‚Äôm so glad that this film was good"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-17,THIS IS GOING TO BE A BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE!! PERIOD.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-08-10,"This is one seriously well made trailer, one of the best I have seen."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,So happy that this actually looks very good. I am excited now.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-08,"I remember when the last film came out, not a single film since has made me grit my teeth, and left me exhausted after watching because of the tension. Now they&#39;re making a new one? And it looks even more gritty? three days after my birthday? Man what a time to be alive."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"Alyssa Sutherland...WOW, choosing the right main one to be possessed is so important and she definitely has that look."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-03-03,This is one of my favorite movies ü§ó
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-12,The Evil Dead of 2013 was absolutely insane.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-23,Just finished watching this movie. A definitely must watch for horror lovers. From beginning to end just non stop action packed horror. The best horror movie ive ever watched in my lifetime.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"As a huge fan of all the films, I&#39;m now deeply excited for this film. This trailer proves that it&#39;s truly theater worthy"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-12-05,One of the best actors in this movie wow holy ‚Ä¶great job!üò≥üò≤üëèüèΩüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòéü§ì I loved this movie I‚Äôll keep on watching it over and over thank you guys! One of many best horror movies I‚Äôve ever seen. A+!
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smTK_AeAPHs&amp;t=114"">1:54</a> nostalgic goosebumps when you see the chainsaw. Remembering Ash.."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-21,This seems like the perfect movie to take my 3 year old to see. Nice wholesome family content.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-02-10,I love when an innocent little girl gets involved in a situation like this in a bloody horror movie. I hope she becomes the sole survivor at the end of the movie.
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-10-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smTK_AeAPHs&amp;t=118"">1:58</a> That smile"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-05-09,The actress who played the mom was just brilliant. I was genuinely creeped out at 29 years oldüòÇ. I even had to pause the scenes to brace myself cause how frightening some parts were. I‚Äôll be watching the original series. I saw the 2013 remake which was pretty awesome too
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-11,I don‚Äôt usually get scared of horror films but this one looks pretty scaryüòÇ
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-27,"This movie was a masterpiece to me very creepy and I loved the atmosphere and the scarier tone it had. Also, the stakes was high for our kid characters very brutal and did not let up and so intense. The change of environment to was utilized to its fullest very claustrophobic and anxiety inducing and all the blood in the third act was gnarly I‚Äôm not sure how people don‚Äôt like this movie it‚Äôs evil dead baby!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-03-07,I recommend this movie . Some scenes are so scary but that‚Äôs the point ! From the beginning to the end Evil Dead Rise keeps the suspense. I watched it one more time yesterday night . I‚Äôve got the first EVIL DEAD on videotape . Never disappointed me !
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-07,"About time, I&#39;ve missed this kind of horror.  It&#39;s been a long time."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-06,"I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I heard about this movie. If the trailer hasn&#39;t taken all of the good scenes from the movie, then this for me is a must see in theaters."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,It&#39;ll be hard to accept a new Evil Dead movie without Ash in it.<br>He&#39;s what made these movies truly special
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-07-29,after watching this i can&#39;t sleep well at night even in full lights on üòÇ
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-27,If you haven‚Äôt seen this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ run to the theater now! Such an amazing movie
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-26,"Who else loves horror movies? My family is too afraid of horror, but I‚Äôm a fan."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smTK_AeAPHs&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> That terrifying shot of the mother reminds me of Cheryl from the original film! üò±"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-10-20,"I could never be creeped out by this franchise, the films were too goofy, but this one... <b>Shivers</b>"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-20,These movies are always the perfect amount of horror and gore üôè
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-04-06,"loved this franchise ever since I was a little kid and I found my parents VHS copy of Evil Dead 2. Even though many people found it comical I was really young and it scared the shit out of me. Army of Darkness was great and I enjoyed the 2013 remake. I can&#39;t wait to see this one, the incantation being played aloud in that tone definitely set the mood, love it."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-18,I like how it looks like a well made scaled back story of how this one family is getting taken over. Ash is probably enjoying a break
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-07-02,I think The Horror Movie Evil Dead Rise is very nice Greetings From The Netherlandsüá≥üá±‚ù§Ô∏èüá≥üá±
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-05,It&#39;s been a long time since a trailer has given me chills like this!
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-02-22,"Man, this trailer alone has all the the great parts from the Evil Dead series, Ash vs Evil Dead, and the 2013 evil Dead movie all into one and I love it! What a Sam Rami classic~ the Dutch cam, the cam tilting, camera zoom, room filled with blood to the brim, sharp objects mm close to the eyes, and of course, the chainsaw ~ you can&#39;t have an evil Dead franchise without the chainsaw &lt;3"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-11,"I‚Äôve really been struggling with the cinematic trite that‚Äôs been released the last few years, particularly in the horror genre, but holy hell this looks scary good! It‚Äôs been so long since a trailer actually creeped me out! Looks legit!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2025-04-25,"As someone who hasn&#39;t seen any of tbe previous films, I enjoyed this one."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-07,The Evil Dead use to be the most horrifying movie when I watched it during my childhood days. I am really excited to see what&#39;s going to come after so many years now
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smTK_AeAPHs&amp;t=126"">2:06</a> The Shining reference üò≥üò±"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,Evil Dead was the best horror movie made in 1980s...and its sequels haven&#39;t really disappointed to scare us either
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-06-28,I got it from Google play. Best horror I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  üòÆ
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-09,Doest matter how many evil dead movies come and go.Evil Dead of 80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s with Bruce Campbell will always be the MASTERPIECE
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-20,"A horror franchise that never loses, It is quite remarkable to consider how Ash effortlessly kills these creatures while still maintaining his sense of humor."
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2023-01-10,"while i love the more comical side of the original evil dead&#39;s, I do enjoy that they&#39;re willing to explore the truly horrific side of it as well. hoping for mostly practical effects in this. I&#39;ve been obsessed with all these films since 2020 when the pandemic hit. something about them just scratches that itch for me - the terror, the visuals, the gore. Just a beautiful combination. Looking forward to more of these in the future!"
Evil Dead Rise,smTK_AeAPHs,2024-10-21,I feel like evil dead is the only classic horror franchise to be completely solid and doesn‚Äôt have a bad movie.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"The Exorcist was the greatest horror film ever made, it&#39;s going to be incredibly difficult to match it&#39;s raw power and shock value no matter how many jump scares are are added to the edit"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-28,"Lifelong horror fan here. I watched The original Exorcist in 1975 when I was in my early teens and I still consider it one of the scariest films ever, if not the scariest. What made it so powerful IMO was the slow buildup with a gradual incursion of evil into very real, gritty lives of people who seemed absolutely credible. The tension was rising, the setting and characters were 100% believable, so that by the time the pea soup was flying, you were all in. The problem with a lot of Hollywood horror now is that they don&#39;t take the time to build up that tension or develop the characters, and just go overboard with over-the-top, all-out explosions of supernatural phenonema in your face 15 minutes in, so that you&#39;re just numb to it."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"I wish that I was able to experience the same thing audiences experienced when the original first came out. It literally scared people into church, people were fainting in movie theaters. <br>The original is truly the best horror movie ever made"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-28,The Exorcist is still and will always be the best movie.  Just watched The  Believer doesn&#39;t even come close. Glad to see Chris and Regan through.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,The Exorcist was the greatest horror film ever made
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-27,"i don‚Äôt think people realize what made the original movie so scary was the lack of media like it at the time. people had never seen something like that presented on screen, leading to a huge cultural impact, that today we just don‚Äôt find shocking."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"One of the reasons why The Exorcist worked for me was that it was based on much older times. The tone of the film felt different and you could feel the evil lurking in the shadows even though the film didn&#39;t show anything. It just gave out an eerie feeling all by itself. It&#39;s worth noting that when The Exorcist was released, it was the first time the public had ever seen anything like it and therefore had such an impact on people. Similar to Star Wars, at the time it was the first of its kind and so it was extremely successful. This new film right away has that modern take which removes a layer of horror already. You don&#39;t get the same feeling of horror when the girl walks into the church as you do when Regan walks into the living room and urinates herself. Not saying this film will suck, I&#39;m simply making observations and opinions. Still I am very excited for this to come out and I hope its a good one!"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-08-06,The Exorcist is the Greatest MOVIE ever made. It‚Äôs a Masterpiece that will never be matched. There is a timelessness to it that Never gets dated. That period 1973 was the Golden Era Of Artistic merit.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-07,"RIP William Friedkin, the legendary director of The Exorcist, single-handedly the most iconic and terrifying film ever made."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-09-03,To have Ellen Burnstyn return to her role as Chris MacNeil 50 years later at 90 years old is incredible. So glad she signed on to this project.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"The reason the original exorcist works so well is because it felt real, it felt like a documentary, it was claustrophobic and centred around one room for the most part. the script and the dialogue was terrifying,  language that we had never heard before.<br><br> modern films just looked to digitally clean and fresh now, they don&#39;t have the look of the films from the 70s that realism that grit"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-16,You have no idea how stoked I am that they actually brought Chris back and the old theme song! This trailer is epic.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-30,"My mother saw the original Exorcist in the theatre, someone actually had a seizure while watching it. That‚Äôs how crazy it was. There are documentaries which explain the sheer pandemonium around the original. Nothing will ever come close."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"The original will always and forever remain the scariest movie of all times, not only did it feel real, the sets and the things the production team did to make it feel real is INSANE, like the swing camera from the stairs going up, the cold room to get the effect form their mouths, and the make up, etc. etc."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-28,"The original came out at a time when nobody saw anything like it. There was suspense and desent from being a normal person to a depraved, possessed monster was gradual. We went on a journey with the mother through the doctor&#39;s tests and theories about what the trouble with the child was. The book was stunning in that respect. So, as the interviews with Blatty states, the film had a sort of  documentary feel about it. So, considering all of that along with all of the movies depicting demonic possession, I have my doubts about this being very scary. Unless the director has done something we haven&#39;t seen before in this movie."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-11-07,Watched the original with my sister and my mom when i was around 9 year&#39;s old and that movie got me into horror films<br>Hands down the best horror film i&#39;ve seen to this day and nothing is even close.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,I‚Äôm glad this is a direct sequel and not a ‚Äúremake‚Äù trailer looks very solid and promising. I‚Äôll definitely be seeing this in the movies
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-28,"For those who are commenting that the original Exorcist was not that scary or &quot;Saw&quot; or other horror movies were much scarier, either did not experience this movie in the 70&#39;s or watched it on television. Watching this movie in a theater back in the day was the most horrifying experience for almost all and no amount of convincing those who just didn&#39;t have that experience will never understand, period!"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-27,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve met before.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMother.‚Äù<br><br>My God, I got such chills. And the music being integrated piece by piece was brilliant."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-03-15,WHEN THE TRAILER IS MORE SCARY THEN THE MOVIE!!!!!!
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"The fact that it can still creep me out, it means something. The Exorcist is still haunting the theaters."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-13,"This trailer doesn‚Äôt hit the same as it does in theaters, I get chills every time I watch it in theaters"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"The biggest challenge for this movie is gonna be the fact that the original movie still scares the living hell out of people , so for this movie to do well , it has to be better than the original one , which is gonna be a hard task. All the best to the creators of this movie , I hope your movie does well enough to make another one next year."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-08,The girl who played Katherine was so good you can definitely tell the parallels with the original movie. I wish they could have invested more into developing her character
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,The exorcist after 50 years still the Best horror movie ever made
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-08,"The creators of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; could never have anticipated that their scripting efforts would result in the creation of the most iconic and legendary horror film in existence. Remarkably, they experienced a profound connection to the essence of their work during its production, sensing a genuine presence of the supernatural forces they were portraying."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-14,Hearing the main theme in the theatre gave me prolonged goosebumps
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-10-06,someone in october 2024?
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"I remember watching The Exorcist as a kid and how badly I was traumatized, but now is my favorite horror movie haha. I know this will be a new generation of horror and I cannot wait. This looks terrifying."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-07,"I actually had goosebumps when Ellen Burstyn appeared. What an actress, what a movie (referring to the original). I will give it a chance !"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-27,‚ÄúThey‚Äôre beating in sync‚Äù omgüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I love that it‚Äôs not a remake or whatever but a sequel. Perfect
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-28,"I just watched this movie. It was spiritual and full of love, I was in tears the whole time. It wasn&#39;t scary but was a shine of light for humanity"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"When we saw the trailer at the beginning of Oppenheimer, the crowd lost their minds when Tubular Bells started blasting! It was the best reaction I‚Äôve seen for a movie trailer in a packed theatre in a long time!"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,I‚Äôve never wanted a movie to be good more than this. I really hope it‚Äôs good
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-09-28,I still get chills down my spine every time I hear that theme start playing.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-15,"I saw this movie last week and it was good.  It was not trying to copy the original Exorcist bit by bit, it had it&#39;s own evils. Entertaining and I say go see it."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,There will never be a more scary movie than the original exorcist
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-31,"I know it probably can‚Äôt top the original, but this actually looks good and freaky af. Most horror films these days are just bad but hopefully they did this right."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-09-22,RIP William Friedkin. Your original masterpiece will never ever be surpassed. The very essence of true filmmaking on the edge of what was possible.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-29,"Just finished watching the movie, it&#39;s pretty bad and everyone involved should be ashamed. It&#39;s so bad, Pazuzu issued a statement saying that he was not associated to the production of this film in any way, shape, or form.<br>There&#39;s nothing in this movie that resembles the dread, the opressive atmosphere of the original, which is the greatest horror movie ever made; the performances are flat and the plot is pretty unimaginative. It&#39;s as if Disney had decided to have a go at exorcism films. Save yourself the time and disappointment and don&#39;t watch this, go watch the original film from 1973 or the excellent sequel The Exorcist 3."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,The original theme song slowly fading into the trailer piece by piece is amazing whoever thought of that needs a raise
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"There will never be another film quite like The Exorcist, but this looks like a promising sequel."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-03,"The talent those young actresses have is astonishing, not many can portray what people say demon possesion looks like realistically."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2025-03-19,"When I first saw this trailer in theatres I thought it was going to be a thriller about two lost girls who try to retain their memories after they were found. But, as soon as a heard the note of the tubular bells at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU&amp;t=45"">0:45</a> I immediately made the connection. I went nuts after seeing the photograph of young Linda Blair and seeing the image of young Ellen Burstyn fading into old Ellen Burstyn. My boyfriend isn&#39;t immersed with horror movies the way I am, so he couldn&#39;t understand why I was so excited. I said &quot;Ellen Burstyn is in her 90s and she is on board with this. That is wicked.&quot;"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"The Exorcist is a haunting masterpiece that explores faith, doubt, and the battle between good and evil, resonates deeply with believers in prayer and exorcism."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,I ABSOLUTELY love how they played the score in between certain scenes for all those that know the sound of it!
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,Wow!  Seeing Ellen Burstyn reprise her role as Chris McNeill is insanely awesome! This movie was released when I was born. I&#39;m a big fan of the original. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-08,"Just got back from seeing it and I‚Äôll give it a thumbs up.  Disturbing modern horror and does it‚Äôs best to stay true to the original with some Easter eggs like Doctor Sleep did with The Shining.  Like Smile earlier this year and several others, I love to see the nexus points between mental illness and spiritual warfare.  This film did a good job throwing it all in the pot, because it always is all in the pot with humanity.  The Dark in me loves this stuff.  The Light in me is still dumbfounded how all of us, actors included, especially those children, how we willingly expose ourselves and offer ourselves up to The Demon in the ways we do.  That is the number one theme of the movie, and why I feel it ended the way it did."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-02,"First watched The Exorcist with my mum. She was in the theatre when she watched it first and witnessed people throwing up, fainting etc. she decided to watch this with me one October evening while I was about 10-11 years old! One of my all time favourite films. This actually looks pretty good, and I‚Äôm excited to see it in full."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-28,"This actually looks pretty good. It‚Äôs hard to live up to the hype of the original exorcist movie 50 years ago, but this definitely has my interest."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-08-06,"I got so bored during this movie that I started searching for a real horror film while watching it. Fortunately, I made the right decision and didn&#39;t even finish this one. Instead, I switched to watching &quot;As Above, So Below,&quot; which still gives me chills."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"One thing I‚Äôll give this trailer alone is the overall aesthetic that The Exorcist films always have.<br><br>From what I see so far, it isn‚Äôt relying a whole lot on jump scares but rather the horror of demon possession. That‚Äôs what made the first Exorcist film so haunting, and exceptionally horrifying.<br><br>This movie won‚Äôt top the 1973 classic but I appreciate how close it‚Äôs trying to replicate the vibe from the first film."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-01,"Recommend listening to Ellen talk about people fainting on first viewing of the exorcist. I remember reading about ppl going into churches so many people were so affected as it was a Oscar film about one of the most traumatic Terrifying subjects that could ever be covered. The acting was just outstanding the effects  way ahead of their time they‚Äôre still mind blowing, especially the end scenes it was more than a film. It was an absolutely phenomenal and I really give it so much support for them to try and come up with another sequel as it‚Äôs so difficult to follow perfection."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"Oh my God. Just hearing that theme again, ....goosebumps. I hope this movie terrifies this generation like the original did."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-26,The original Exorcist came out in 1973. 50 years ago. As still as scary today as it was then. They should have just left this masterpiece alone in my opinion.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"It just isn&#39;t the same without the genius of William Peter Blatty. Exorcist 1 and 3 are absolute masterpieces that simply cannot be surpassed by the modern style of directing and movie making. It was what Blatty DIDN&#39;T show on screen - by arriving late and cutting early that was so damned scary. Watch them again with this in mind and you&#39;ll see what I mean. With all that being said, this did send a bit of a chill up my spine, especially when Chris McNeil showed up on screen. I&#39;ll be checking it out for sure. The way they only played a small part of the tubular bells theme from the original interspersed between cuts until the black and white flashes towards the end was very well done btw. But people just don&#39;t get that the original movie is not really about possession, it&#39;s about the loss of faith. That faith being chipped away at bit by bit, by small but constant evils, and the re-discovery of that FAITH when confronted by a terrible and nearly overwhelming evil."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"It is nice to see, no matter how the film is remade, that they managed to bring back Ellen Burstyn! Also this looks more promising in tone with the original film, as opposed to any of the later sequels from the 2000s and even that TV remake. I‚Äôll have hope this will be scary!"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-29,"I love all the references to the original. Like when the girl says ‚Äúmother please make it stop‚Äù - that‚Äôs exactly what Regan said in the original. With the exception of ‚Äúit‚Äôs burning‚Äù vs ‚Äúit‚Äôs hurting‚Äù. Also the flashing scenes at the end of this trailer references a banned trailer from the original 70s version. I don‚Äôt exactly remember the reason it got banned, but I believe it had to do with seizures (?). Super excited for this."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-08,"Just watched the new Exorcist movie.  I don&#39;t understand the snobby hatred for this.  That movie was so good!!!!   I can see some flaws, but I was well entertained and the message was this:  we are born into this world full of hopes and dreams and no matter what horrible shit happens in our lives, we have to have hope and know that brighter days are ahead.  <br>Super good movie.  The effects are almost all practical.  Very little (if any) CGI.  Some hokey moments and very preachy moments.  Overall I&#39;m thrilled!  Best movie I&#39;ve seen in a while."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> I love how Chris says ‚Äúwe‚Äôve met before‚Äù, her playing a major role in this film is one of the only reasons I‚Äôm holding out hope that it‚Äôll be good. Plus, Leslie Odom Jr. is a fantastic actor, so I‚Äôm sure he and Ellen Burstyn will be the highlights. But I think it would be more impactful if Regan and Chris were helping Leslie‚Äôs character together, and Regan should have delivered the ‚Äúwe‚Äôve met before‚Äù line to Pazuzu instead of her mom. It‚Äôd be more effective because REGAN was the one who suffered the most at his hands. I wanna see her get revenge on Pazuzu."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-31,"I was a kid when The Exorcist came out in 1973, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to see it, but everyone I knew who did was scared liked never before. There had never been anything like it, and it really freaked people out. When I was old enough to see it, I couldn‚Äôt get it out my mind for over a month. Even now at 50+ years old, I still cannot watch it, not even trailers. <br>This trailer did not scare me, the horror of the original cannot be matched."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,The Exorcist is an absolute classic in The Horror Genre. Can‚Äôt wait for this movie.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-01-07,"Imagine watching this not knowing you&#39;re about to find a new favorite musician with a raw voice acting in it. I went to google the actor and fell in love with the songs he released. Listen to Loved, whoever reads this comment."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-09-05,"I was 11 years old when I saw the original at the drive in theater with my parents and my little brother.  It was scary indeed, but thoroughly enjoyed it."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,Ngl... the part where she says &quot;God played a trick on you..&quot; smiles and then the loud black and white imagery flashing with sounds and the theme song then plays was SOO GOOD. Saw this as a trailer during Oppenheimer and was surprised how great this looked! üëèüèΩ
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-31,"I saw this trailer in the theater last night. At first I thought it looked super bad, as the trailer went on I found myself sinking farther into my seat. Excited to see this!"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-17,"This is the best Exorcist sequel, yes people it is far better than the boring Exorcist 3"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-07,"My mother saw The Exorcist (1973) in theaters, she was only 8 years old at the time. It‚Äôs her all time favorite horror movie, and the only movie she deems ‚Äústill scares the shit out of her‚Äù. I remember we went to Blockbuster back around 2001 and rented The Exorcist for a family movie night. I watched it at 5 years old! Anyways, the movie was so traumatizing for me, I only made it to the spider walk scene before running out of the room in terror. In our house, at the time, we had a set of stairs similar to the one in that scene just above our tv area in the living room and after watching that, I never liked looking at the stairs at night anymore for the rest of my childhood. It took me 10 years later to get through my fear and actually sit down and watch The Exorcist in full when I was then 15. I absolutely love the movie now and it‚Äôs a must play every October for me, but it still makes my skin crawl every time I watch it, especially during the Pazuzu jump scares. Now, just as back then for my mom, I will go see this one in theaters. I don‚Äôt expect it to top the original, but I hope it represents the franchise right this time after many bad remakes and sequels in the years after and pays homage to the original respectfully."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-09,"I was very into horror as a kid growing up in the 90s. As a general rule, my parents would let me watch/rent any horror movie I wanted except one...The Exorcist. My mom would go on to tell me she saw it in theaters and was so disturbed by it that she didn&#39;t want that movie in the house and was afraid it would traumatize me. I finally saw it when I was 15 or so."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-27,Who else got goosebumps when the first few piano keys hit?<br><br>Howlong has it been since the third one?
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-10-18,The monster face like my neighbors face üòÇüòÇ
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,What I love about this movie is Chris MacNiel&#39;s determination to help other girls that went through the same hell as her daughter Regan.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,Can we all just acknowledge how incredible Ellen Burstyn looks here at 90 YEARS OLD! She is a living Hollywood Legend. Would never put her at 90 if I didn&#39;t know.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-12,‚ÄúThe body and the blood‚Äù part and their heartbeats is what sold me. This looks fantastic
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-09-12,"How many times have they tried to make a film similar to The Exorcist with new Exorcist movies and terrible movies that tried to be like The Exorcist. It just doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t remake classics like The Exorcist, Alice Sweet Alice, Poltergeist, the Friday the 13th films, the Nightmare on Elm Street Films, The Shining, etc. You know why? Because they had an aura to them that cannot be matched today and they were made in a time people knew how to make films. To be honest, I&#39;m not even excited for the new Beetlejuice movie."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,You can‚Äôt beat a classic no matter how good they make this it‚Äôll never be as good it‚Äôs impossible
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-15,"There&#39;s no way it can be as good as the original, but this is the first trailer in years that legit creeped me out."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,Still till this day The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever and still gives me chills. Definitely excited to see what this movie brings to the table
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-04-17,"In this film, there&#39;s a notable trend where Christian characters are portrayed in a negative light as well as any other movies out there. The priest, depicted as a coward, is killed while praying, while the pastor serves only as a peripheral character. Additionally, a church-going father makes a selfish decision, and his daughter, who is also portrayed as a devout Christian, meets a tragic end. This portrayal is consistent with a pattern observed in many Netflix series, where Christian figures are either depicted as weak or are prematurely removed from the storyline. Interestingly, the film also features a black female character practicing some voodoo like stuff who is portrayed positively and as a cool person, adding a contrasting depiction of religious practices. This choice, along with the incomplete prayer of another father who, despite not finishing his prayer, manages to save his daughter, underscores a recurring theme in the narrative&#39;s treatment of Christian characters. So this movie is telling you that it&#39;s not God who saves you, but yourself."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-15,Looks quite decent.. ppl gotta accept it‚Äôll never top the original but this could be an ok movie
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-28,This will be great for a new generation to experience even a fraction of what the first movie did to audiences. I‚Äôm excited.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,I was skeptical in the beginning until I stuck till the end of the trailer. The Original Exorcist is one of my all time favorite horror films and this looks promising.
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-30,Feels like David just swapped characters and music and used the same Halloween set üòÇ
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,Honestly I‚Äôm so excited to see Ellen back! She‚Äôs a phenomenal actress even now!
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"The Exorcist is the one true SCARY movie. I can watch horror movies all day every day and not feel what the first one made me feel as a child and still as an adult. It is cinematic perfection. Still holds up to this very day, let alone impacting the world like it did in ‚Äò73. I surely hope this one holds up. Exorcism movies are getting kind of tired and formulaic. I hope this one is the freshness the genre needs."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-02,I saw the original when I was 10 years old in a pitch black room by myself. It was both amazing and terrifying. Little did I know how much the original scarred me as I cannot watch ANY movie with demonic possessions as a plot. What a masterpiece!
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-11-05,"The old timers got to chill with the bad reviews of the sequel and how ‚Äúnothing can beat the original‚Äù. You all saw it when the concept was new and that made it scary. Cinema has developed since then and the Younger generations have other well made and scary horror movies to compare it to which might not make us adore the 1973 version as you all do. This sequel is good, forget the negative reviews."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-04,"No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be better than the original, but I‚Äôm not going into expecting something better. I just hope it‚Äôs a good, well made possession horror. The trailer looks promising and those two girls seem like they are gonna give amazing performances. Which is something that made the original so iconic, the performance of the young girl Linda Blair."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-31,"Can‚Äôt wait to see this! My mom was pregnant with me when the first Exorcist came out. She was denied entry in to the theater because it was  thought to be too disturbing for pregnant women. I‚Äôm in my late 40s now and am a huge horror fan, but I still can‚Äôt watch that that movie alone."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-10,"I‚Äôm here to give full credit to the person who edited this trailer. The way he threw in the Tubular bells by Mike Oldfield (music from the original Exorcist) is what made my ears perk up. I was sitting there waiting for Oppenheimer to start and thought here‚Äôs a trailer for yet another horror film but then the bells played‚Ä¶.and stopped‚Ä¶.and my heart stopped, and I said to myself‚Äô ‚Äúcould it be‚Ä¶? It can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ ‚Äú and then I yelled both in horror and excitement that IT ISSSS.‚Äù  Full marks to the editor!!üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºThat build up was everything."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-06-13,"Don&#39;t listen to the critics this movie is really good, it&#39;s a must watch.."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-13,"The exorcist is the greatest horror movie ever made. No need to compare this new one with the original, just enjoy it for what it is. Previews look good, I‚Äôll be in the theater the day it drops for sure."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"Out of all the Exorcist films we&#39;ve had, this might be better than those knockoff films that have the Exorcist name"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-27,Nothing can top the original but this looks insane I‚Äôm definitely can‚Äôt wait to see it
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2024-01-04,"Screw Blumhouse, nobody asked for more Exorcist films. The original 1973 film is the one true Gem."
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-08-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU&amp;t=107"">1:47</a> The best 10 seconds ever"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,"This trailer got me in the mood to rewatch the og movie and it‚Äôs clear that no madder how good this movie is, it will never come close to the first movie. That movie had such a unique style that I don‚Äôt think could ever be replicated, not even by blumhouse and David Gordon green"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-25,"If they&#39;re gonna do a trilogy, I&#39;m curious how Regan is gonna come back into this...and also if they&#39;ll follow different people or the same ones"
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-10-12,I can totally relate. I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s and watch me scream like a baby when I go see this movie this weekend. üòÇ
The Exorcist: Believer,PIxpPMyGcpU,2023-07-26,Nothing can beat the original exorcist
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-06,Glad to see this bear getting more roles. I&#39;ve been a fan since The Revenant.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,Crazy how Ray Liotta has like 3-4 more upcoming movies left even after his death. What a legend. Rest in piece Ray.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-05,"This is beautiful. Best true story I&#39;ve ever seen. For five minutes, from the moment this bear ate the cocaine, to the moment it died of a heart attack it was the world&#39;s apex predator. And now it&#39;s on the big screen."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-03-30,‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what kind of effect that has on him.‚Äù Has the same vibes as ‚Äúwhat could possibly go wrong?‚Äù and I love it.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-06,Finally a movie for those of us who&#39;ve been able to blend in with the other mature adults but our hearts can&#39;t deny what really amuses us
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,What an amazingly uplifting story about a timid little black bear finally learning to unwind.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,Love how this bear career is going in Hollywood. From Revenant to Prey now this movie. Give this bear an Oscar!
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2024-05-02,"Fun fact: This bear actually spent a weekend with charlie sheen to prepare for the role, amazing professionalism and dedication to his role. What an uplifiting and inspirational tale"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,I love that they managed to make this story into a full length feature film.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-03,"If they wanted us to come running back to theaters, this is the kind of movie they should&#39;ve offered sooner. I&#39;m definitely going."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-03,"Give this bear an Oscar. Not only did it do cocaine in such large quantity, it also didn&#39;t die of a heart attack immediately!"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-09-16,"I love that line. &quot;Apex Predator, High on Cocaine, Out of it&#39;s mind.&quot; LOL"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-02,"This story is one of my favorite weird history stories ever. This movie looks like silly fun, and I&#39;m 100% with it."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,"This movie actually brings some horror b-movie vibes of the 1980s, gory and funny AF in that sense. And I&#39;m surprised Ray Liotta made an appearance in this film before his passing. Also, the fact that Cocaine Bear is inspired by a true story, that&#39;s pretty hard to believe. Be definitely lookin forward to seeing this one in the theaters for real"

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,It&#39;s crazy to say that a movie about a bear doing blow looks like the most entertaining movie to come out in a long time.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,"The &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; movie I always wanted, and it&#39;s apparently going to be the Horror/Comedy I never knew I wanted. Long live Pablo Escobear."

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,"Never thought I‚Äôd see a movie like this be made in this day in age out of fear of it not doing well, but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs happening. Hope it‚Äôs good"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-03,"Fantastic cast, Ray Liotta will be missed. Love that he still has movies coming out. This looks amazing."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-11,I&#39;m glad this documentary is finally receiving the attention it deserves

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,It&#39;s like we&#39;re bringing back the spirit of the 2000&#39;s with this one. All for it.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,A movie about a bear high off cocaine that&#39;s also Ray Liotta&#39;s last ever film appearance...<br><br>This is cinema.<br><br>RIP Ray.‚ù§
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,"Looks insanely fun, I love these movies that don‚Äôt take themselves seriously, and the fact it‚Äôs based on a true story is hilarious"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-03-29,"I went in watching this movie thinking how it could have possibly even made it into theaters and came out thinking how genius of a movie it is. Like an actual genius script writer/ director could wrote this. Refreshing ass movie, original, not an old movie no one asked to remake, not a sequel (yet?) and had a mix of comedy and suspense. GG"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,Give this movie an Oscar already
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-06,"I love how this never really happened with the real cocaine bear but this what you‚Äôd imagine from hearin the story for the first time, just the term alone ‚Äúcocaine bear‚Äù it‚Äôs insane"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,The greatest movie of 2023 is approaching‚Ä¶.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-04-05,"This movie was actually very good. It had the right amount of serious dashed with good comedy scenes! It&#39;s up there with Eight Legged freaks for me! I was surprised I found myself rooting for the bear most of the movie too, especially at the end though!  For those who don&#39;t know, this movie is loosely based on a real event of a grizzly ingesting about 75Ibs of coke but it died too quick to have even had the chance to hurt anyone thankfully, too bad for that bear:("
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-09,"Finally a movie with top of the line CGI and a rich well-written plot. The way the comedy flows into the horror makes for an exceptional experience, leaving family‚Äôs just on the line of wondering what they just watched. Perfect use of an A-List actor who, since Goodfellas, has never not been taken seriously. Just an outstanding casting and downright masterpiece revitalizing confidence for Hollywood in this uncertain time. Oscar winner for sure!"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,We need to make this the highest grossing movie to date.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,"I think the most hilarious part about this is the fact that side from the comedy bits, this story is true. A bear did get into cocaine and for like 5 minutes or something, it was the absolute most dangerous animal on the planet before it did eventually die"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-03-20,&quot;Pablo Eskobear&quot; Lord that&#39;s funny  üòÇ üòÄ
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-02-23,I think what makes this even better is that this movie looks like it actually has somewhat of a budget. With a premise like that you&#39;d expect it to be like a low effort straight to DVD movie but they actually decided to make this a real thing and I kinda love it!
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-03,"I don&#39;t know how this movie ever got made - but I am SO glad it did. At the point in the trailer where the bear was chasing the ambulance, I completely lost it haha. Definitely going to check it out."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,Just say to your best friend &quot;You wanna go see Cocaine Bear in theaters?&quot; Love the absurdity of it all.

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-02,<b>This honestly looks like it&#39;s gonna have amazing dark humor</b>

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-04,"People need to go see this, big studios need to know that movies that aren&#39;t super hero related can also do well at the box office"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-06-23,I watched this movie with friends after watching the trailer. We were talking about the trailer and then my dad said ‚ÄúHow about we watch it at the theatre?‚Äù <br><br><br>üíÄ

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-03,I‚Äôm surprised by the quality of the cinematography and lighting of the film. The shot were the bear first appears is especially outstanding.

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-02-21,Bear doing a line off a dismembered arm clinches it. I&#39;m difinitely going to see this movie.

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-06,"Interesting fact: the original movie was called bear, but when the bear showed up on set for filming, he was actually on cocaine. The director loved it so much he changed the whole movie."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-01-27,I sincerely hope people show up on opening night in full bear costumes

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,I just watched an entire trailer with my mouth open. I thought it was a joke until I saw the talented actors who are in it. EPIC!
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-27,the fact that this is based on a true incident makes this 110% funnier and scarier
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-04-14,"Just watched this movie and I loved it!  It&#39;s the perfect mix of gore and comedy. You&#39;ve got to go and see for yourself, you won&#39;t regret it! camera work awesome, the bear - epic. I give this movie 7/10 !"
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,This is going to be a cinematic masterpiece the likes of which have never been seen before.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,The fact that this is based on a true story
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-02-23,Imagine Ray Liotta arriving in Heaven:<br>&quot;So what was your last role?&quot;<br>&quot;I had to fight against a stoned bear.&quot;
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-09-16,Just finished this on Prime. OMFG my sides were hurting from the laughs. That ambulance scene was gold!<br><br>R.I.P. Ray Liotta. What a way to end his run.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-11-30,I haven&#39;t been inspired to see a movie in a theatre in like 5 years. I am now.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-05,I&#39;ve haven&#39;t had a smile this big on my face in years.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,"I&#39;m calling it now.  &quot;Film of the Year&quot;.  I&#39;m going to see this one in the fancy theater, the one with the comfy recliner chairs and chicken wings.  It&#39;s what this film deserves."
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2023-06-09,At long last a new film that was fun and enjoyable.<br>And no social justice in sight.<br>Please give us more of this stuff.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-01,Almost impossible for any movie to live up to a masterpiece of a trailer like this one is. Haven¬¥t had so many laughs watching a trailer in years. I can¬¥t BEAR the wait for this movie to drop!
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-05,What a very inspiring tale of a shy little black bear finding his peace.
Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2022-12-30,I totally lost it when the bear started sliding towards the people on its back and did a line on somebody&#39;s arm ü§£

Cocaine Bear,DuWEEKeJLMI,2025-01-16,"Obviously Universal Studios is so brilliant that this is one of their greatest works, low-key"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-01,"Just saw this. This movie delivers a very strong message about how we should cherish our memories and live a full life at the same time, no matter the age. Don&#39;t get trapped in the past, it becomes a burden too heavy to carry."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-07,"My wife and I were in Pittsburgh for an appointment, arrived way too early so we went for a walk. We saw a film crew setting up, they had streets blocked off, so for curiosities sake we stood by and watched for a moment. Out of nowhere, Tom Hanks walked right up to my wife and I... even though he was wearing a face mask he was instantly recognizable and as he approached my wife said &quot;OMG it&#39;s Tom Hanks&quot;!!! Mr Hanks pretended to look about frantically and said &quot;REALLY? WHERE????!!!&quot; and we laughed. He stood and talked to us, took a photo with us, and was so kind. Anyway, he did that because we were in an area where we weren&#39;t supposed to be, and someone on the film crew was about to come over and yell at us and Tom Hanks scolded the person and decided to just come over and talk to us, rather than someone yelling at us. We had no idea what actor was there or even why the camera&#39;s were being set up, we were just people going for a walk. Thank you Mr Hanks for making our day that day, and for your overwhelming kindness!"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-03,"I read A Man Called Ove when i went to rehabilitation for alcoholism. I don&#39;t think I ever appreciated how much joy and love there is in this world outside of my negative, depressing, loveless ways of thinking about the world around me. 60 days of being internal with no tv, cell phone, or news, just books. And Ove, well, he changed my life. I always imagined Robert Dinero or Tom Hanks playing Ove in my head. I literally just thought about the book looking back just now and to my surprise a movie is coming out this soon. Unreal. Although I am sober right now there are times where i start with that negative thinking and i remind myself all the love i would lose if i drank again. Thank you to the original Author of a Man Called Ove, thank you to T.Hanks and his crew for making this movie , and to the makers of the original swedish version (which i didn&#39;t even know or thought it would exist until now).<br><br>Here&#39;s to being sober. And to all of you struggling out there with addiction, remember to never say never, just say for now, the next 5 minuts, next 5 days. Just never say never and BREATHE. Your family loves you, your kids love you, and even without that know that, not just God, but YOU Love YOU."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-09,"Im a 27 year old guy, i randomly watched this beautiful film. I hardly cry in movies. This movie had me in Tears. Made me imagine a life without my loved ones. The ending broke me. Tom hanks is one of the best actors along Leonardo."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-07,"I have never left a review on a movie, but this movie was special. The story is not complicated, but it touches your soul. Everything about this movie was exceptional. I am currently crying writing this review."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-20,"I cried watching the Swedish movie and cried even harder reading the book, it was a great blend of dark humor, seeing Ove (Otto) processing his grief was quite sad but watching him grow with his community was wholesome.  I love Tom Hanks and i hope this version is as good as the Swedish film and the book."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-04,"I‚Äôm 28 and lost my dad suddenly to a stroke almost 5 years ago. My family blew apart at the seems and I moved home from college thinking we would grieve together, but have been the only person living in the house we all grew up in since, which is like living in a loop of both what was and what you wish still was, the most <br><br>Not too proud to say life‚Äôs been a mess: I have been so lonely, angry and shut out from the world since he‚Äôs been gone that I am quite indeed a young Otto‚Ä¶ but I almost felt like my dad was talking to me through the movie telling me that it‚Äôs okay to keep living without him. I broke down multiple times and that‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt let myself do enough. Thank you Tom Hanks ‚ù§Ô∏è <br><br>Check on your friends. You never know what battles they‚Äôre fighting"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-15,"just finished watching this on netflix and I&#39;m still bursting into tears, from this film I came to understand the life of senior citizens who are more than just humans who are enjoying their old age but also they still have to deal with their own problems . This film really opened up my way of understanding senior citizens and moved my heart to become a personality like Marisol, as I am a 19-year-old human being who has never acknowledged senior citizens like Otto himself. so yeah... this is a movie you must see once in your lifetime . <br>üíô"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-05,Everyone needs a marisol in their life ‚ù§Ô∏è
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-20,"I loved that the protagonist grew and started to heal with the help of platonic friends (particularly Marisol&#39;s family) and neighbors and not with the help of a romantic interest. We need more movies like this. It was absolutely the best one I&#39;ve seen in a while. So many amazing messages and it was just absolutely touching. There are many people struggling just like Otto, and sometimes with a little compassion, love, patience and a dash of humor we may just be able to be a &quot;Marisol&quot; to someone or an &quot;Otto&quot; to someone like Malcolm and vice versa or really any of the amazing characters in this film that loved one another (particularly Otto) when they most needed it and help them through the darkness to the light. <br>‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-31,"i dont remember the last time i cried for a movie. watching this in netflix at night made my eyes swell up in the morning. what a wonderful movie. a very powerful message of cherishing our life, and there are still good things in life no matter what."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-08,"I was not expecting this movie to be this great,  this amazing.  Every character is well developed and the human connection is amazing.  Be sure to have a full box of tissues when you watch it."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-30,Tom Hanks never fails to deliver. Touching movie with meaningful life messages.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-03,"As a widow of just under two years, I can fully appreciate where &quot;Otto&quot; is coming from. My husband was the light of my life...to be without him is a pain I never thought I&#39;d feel...at least until I was near 80, anyway. He passed after along struggle with COPD...now I do find myself a bit of a grump, it takes serious efforts some days to get my head out of that dark, depressed place. I keep busy and realize, I am still here for a reason...when that reason time period is over, I will get to join my dearly beloved. Rest in peace, babe..."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-20,The Swedish movie was PERFECT. i felt every emotion. I hope that it is the same with this one.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-04-14,Just saw the movie.. Brilliant acting by Tom. I&#39;m sure there are so many Ottos in the world who live with grief and many Marisols who spread love...and has a BIG HEART..
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-21,"The original movie A man called Ove is truly a masterpeice. Ive cried so hard to that movie.<br>I will watch this, but I doubt they will catch me getting as emotional as I was during the original swedish version.<br>Tom Hanks a really good actor though, so Im somewhat hopefull this will make it."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-21,A chunk of this movie was filmed outside of Pittsburgh. I work in the one town and whole filming the crew couldn&#39;t have been kinder to everyone. The fact that Tom Hanks was waving and talking to everyone not to mention randomly showing up at people&#39;s weddings to wish them luck just makes me want to see the movie more.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-15,"The book made me cry, the original Swedish film made me cry and I have feeling this version will make me tear up too. It&#39;s a sad and heartwarming story all at once."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-11-02,"i felt Otto&#39;s sadness right from the start of the film.  I knew what&#39;s going on on his head. The kindness of his old and new neighbor/friends to him, his subconscious gesture to take initiative of giving a hand when needed, plus the comfort of having a pet to keep you company, and the reality of life of old people--everything on this film was painfully beautiful and i cried my heart out.  This made its mark on my heart already.  Such a gem i found.  I thank the author of this novel btw."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-05,Gotta say im so tough...dont really tear for anything.<br><br>That being said.<br><br>THIS   MOVIE. TOUCHED. ME.  SO   MUCH.  TO ALL THE OTTOS OUTTHERE... WE LOVE YOU..TAKE CARE
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-03,Just finished watching this wholesomely beautiful movie! I am in tears right now! I almost gave up on Hollywood after a series of awful flicks that I had to go through but this gem of a film singlehandedly restored my hope. One of those movies that is supremely feel-good and at the same time it had a sad hint to it and the acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks is always good and he doesn&#39;t need any introduction but the rest of the cast was really great too. Go watch it if you haven&#39;t already!
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-07,"I think everyone who watched this movie understands how much my emotions have literally been teared apart, I was literally crying from start to ending and this movie literally broke me to way too much tears"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-22,"Absolutely beautiful movie. I‚Äôve never been married but this film really conveyed the loneliness you can go through when you lose your life partner. Not ashamed to say I absolutely bawled my eyes out. I hope to find a girl that completed me the way Sonya did Otto. And to everyone reading this, you‚Äôre never alone and even after losing someone so pivotal, there will always be enough love around you to help you through, sometimes you just gotta look for it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-09,this movie was so precious I cried in my bed for 2 hours like a child. Tom Hanks never disappoint
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-07,This movie made you think of so much. Amazing . Also makes you understand why a lot of old people are grumpy because of their life missing one another.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-18,"As someone who has just seen it this past weekend, I have to be honest when I say this was the most aspiring film I‚Äôve seen in my whole entire life.Even more than one of Hanks‚Äôs famous roles as Forrest in Forrest Gump, this film will bring out every single emotion that any true human being has. Not only the writer and the director do I applaud, but every single actor and actress in this movie played their specific roles better than I have ever seen in a single movie. It truly is astounding, and as a young man who embellishes and loves movies and has been intrigued to them for a long time with my girlfriend, I give my honest word that this is in no doubt too 5 films I have ever seen. Warning, it‚Äôs not for the faint hearted and if you are, please take full note of the movie and realize there is so much love to be found. God bless you all"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-27,"I&#39;m still crying an hour after watching this film. So beautiful, heartwarming. As someone above said everyone needs a Marisol in their life. I&#39;m getting emotional again just typing this. Beautiful, just beautiful ü•∞"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-28,The ending had me crying uncontrollably. A gem of a movie ‚ù§‚ù§
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-31,"Just watched this movie.I can&#39;t tell u how heart touching it was! In an era where people mind their own business,it tells how good Neighbors and people who care can change your life.‚ù§Ô∏è"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-20,"I just watched it. I didn&#39;t think it would make me cry this much, but it&#39;s Tom &amp; the movie is so touching...

Thank you for this gem!<br><b>20 May 2023</b>"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-13,Emotions were swelling up all along the movie untill the end came and they bursted into unblockable tears. That&#39;s what we call a tear-jerker. Must watch
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-12,Best part for me is marisol laughing at doctor diagnosis report &quot;big heart&quot;
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-04,"A Man Called Ove was my first Fredrik Backman book and inspired me to read all his other works, so this story holds a special place in my heart. I hope this film does it justice."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-10-08,"I must say, this is one of the best movies I have seen. Tom Hanks never disappoint‚Ä¶Brilliant actor"

A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-02-05,"Such a good movie about learning to live again after loss and letting go when it‚Äôs time. Beautiful depiction of the cycle of life &amp; importance of community. highly recommend! I thought the ending was poetic, beautiful, and real. Not dark. Great movie if you‚Äôre not afraid to feel the full range of emotions, I laughed and cried throughout it. It touches on difficult subjects but brings life and hope to them. It also brings awareness to things seniors have to deal with."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-24,"Tom Hanks, no questions. hands down acting. Bravo. But i came here to check and i didnt see any high recognitions to what Marisol contributed to this masterpiece. The actress was so great here. Netflix should give her more projects. An amazing actress."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-11-27,"I hope my wife doesn&#39;t see this, but I cried multiple times during this movie. It was absolutely beautiful..."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-09-10,This man&#39;s smile makes me happy but when this man dies on screen make me cry..<br>Love you Otto<br>Love you T. Hanks
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-10-19,"I watched this film for the first time the other day. <br><br>One of the most powerful, thought provoking, brilliant films I&#39;ve ever seen, I thought it was excellent"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-27,"A fellow Otto living in the US here. My heart skipped a beat when he had to spell his name for the little girl. I have to spell my name regularly when people give me a blank look after I introduce myself.<br>If I pronounce the &quot;t&quot;-s, many people think my name is &quot;Octo&quot;. If I pronounce it with an American accent as Tom Hanks did in the trailed with a &quot;d&quot;, many think it&#39;s &quot;Auto&quot;. I can&#39;t win. Sometimes I just tell them my name is Arnold.<br><br>I sincerely think this movie will change my life, and I can re-claim my own name! I cannot wait to watch it...üòç<br><br>My Dad was born in 1940 as the tenth child in a poor family in rural Hungary. That time Hungary was on Germany&#39;s side in WW2, and had big hopes in getting their lost territories back. This is why he was given a German name, which became my own name as his firstborn and why I became known as Arnold in Starbucks."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-17,"I usually hate remakes, let alone when the original is in another language, but I&#39;m gonna give this a shot just because of Tom Hanks. I love this man."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-03-28,Adding this to my fav movie list! I don‚Äôt normally write in the comments but if you‚Äôre looking to watch a worth while movie... THIS is it! Crying as I just finished this movie
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-14,"Been watching Tom Hanks since The Man with One Red Shoe, Big, and The Money Pit! Such an AWESOME actor! Need more Hank Movies!!!"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-13,Oh my god. A man called Ove is absolutely one of the best books ever. I cannot wait to see this version
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-04-02,Hanks is the best actor ever....i laughed and cried throughout the movie.... another master piece of this true artist
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-12-02,"I watched this movie today, 3rd dec 2024. I smiled, and tears dropped from eyes when I saw that finally Otto had found a good purpose to live for. At the end I was so heart broken and cried because he finally died, meaning with all he had coming his way to show him that there was still something to live for, did not mean anything to him. Please in any situation you find yourself in, remember there always something to love for even when you feel what you lived for is gone. Remember we live for others not really for ourselves. Let peace prevail over the world."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-10,"Actually my wife and I recently looked into the cinema programme and decided there was nothing that really tickled our fancy. However, a few days ago, the evening before a holiday we decided on a little date night and just went for A Man Called Otto, which in my mind is a beautiful piece of film! I didn&#39;t even watch the trailer beforehand, so except the few bits of info my wife fed me, I wasn&#39;t really sure what we were getting into. I think I can confidently say that I have never cried this much during a film. From the reveal of what happened to the wife and the baby over to Otto becoming a sort of grandpa to Marisol&#39;s kids just took me on an emotional rollercoaster. I envisioned becoming a father one day, making my dad a grandpa, which I know he&#39;d love and be awesome at. Those were the tears of excitement and joy. At the same time, I remembered my own grandpa who passed over 16 years ago and I am still very sad sometimes that he isn&#39;t around anymore. Furthermore, my wife and I have not even been married for a full year and known each other for just over five but the film made me go through all the memories we&#39;ve made so far, making me even more thankful for her being with me, me not being alone and having someone by my side to love and cherrish the time together. This made me feel positive about the future and what is to come for us.<br>I will probably carry the memories from this one forward for a long time. It has a special place in my heart.<br>Thank you, Mr. Tom Hanks for playing this character in such a great way and thank you to the entire cast and crew for making such a wonderful piece of film. In my opinion this one deserves a few awards! Greetings and lots of love from Berlin, Germany."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-12,"A man called Otto has another incredible performance from the great Tom Hanks. All the other actors were impressive as well. Especially Mariana Trevino, who was exceptional. She has this endearing, lovable presence that captivates the viewers attention every time shes on screen."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-09-10,I&#39;m luchador wrestler and I cried watching the ending of this movie.<br><br>&quot;Marrisol is not an idiot.&quot; - Otto
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-10-18,"This one got me y&#39;all, can&#39;t even lie, held strong for so many movies, but this the one that broke me. Glad I was alone and nobody was a witness to the tears. AWESOME MOVIE."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-13,"Best Tom Hanks movie so far. If it doesn&#39;t touch your heart, you don&#39;t have one."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-02-10,"I started the book but never completed it, but my sisters are fans of this one. I really love the fact that Tom hanks is the actor, and havent seen the movie yet but the comments here are pure heart love letters. Thank you for creating this one."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-09,I have an enlarged ‚ô• heart. My husband and I knew each other since we were kids. I consider myself lucky. He takes care of me and still makes me laugh. I hope when it&#39;s my time he lives on and doesn&#39;t worry. He said if I go he goes and it scares me. I just watched this on Netflix. Boy did I have a good cry. I would say to anyone what a fantastic movie. You have to see it. For now we are living our best life. I have no regrets. Tom hanks as always is truly amazing.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-10-13,"Just cried and shed tears for hours. When you think its time to die, then others who love you let you know that its really time to live, and you live, Tom hanks the only actor in the whole world to play the role of Otto, which is spelt &quot;otto&quot; which is the same spelt backwards. Now Otto is my favourite movie. Thanks for making this movie it means more to me than you&#39;ll know, as presently I am in early Otto mode myself? I am 70 years of age and I don&#39;t have a hose pipe to put in the exhaust tail pipe? Perhaps their might be those who would say that I don&#39;t need a hosepipe anyways."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-03-10,this film blew me away... i was in tears throughout. the actress was amazing and tom was incredible too  <br>i wish there was more movies like this and i hope tom does many more movies because he is a truly great actor.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-25,The scene where he takes her out to dinner is a thing of beauty.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-06,Just finished watching this movie and I absolutely loved it! Tom Hanks is seriously going to be missed! This movie made me wanna cry a few times! It‚Äôs like peeking into the life of an elderly person. Brilliant performance ‚ù§
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-04-19,"Huh! I&#39;m just crying because I miss my grandfather who died last year. This movie touched my soul and now I can&#39;t stop crying. So many wonderful comments in the comment section. Oh God! Maybe this is life, maybe this is happiness with little things! God thanks for everything! Miss you dadu!"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-09-29,"Tom Hanks, for me, one of the only well-known actors that completely disappears every time I start one of his movies. When I‚Äôm watching him, I never find myself thinking, ‚ÄúWow. Tom‚Äôs really killing it. I am so impressed,‚Äù because I forgot that Tom was in it about five minutes in, and am instead just watching Otto go about his life. <br><br>I forget how good Tom is sometimes, but when I remember, I remember that he‚Äôs one of the greats."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-24,Been really surrounded of Suicide and depression lately and Im of them altho im trying to heal my pain and lived life but sometimes sadness could just creep out and push you to dark place again. But i always remind myself there are people that Love and appreciate me. This movie is just one hell of a wake up call to realize that life should be lived in. Life is precious if you choose to. Tom Hanks never disappoints. This is just one great movie.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-17,"I went to go and see this just to keep my mother company. And I was in awe about it. It was awesome. I laughed, tears was coming out. It gave me a 80‚Äôs love of one‚Äôs neighborhood, everyone look out for each other, family vibe."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-11,I lost my friend 4 years ago with the same method as Otto did in the begining. The only different is that there is no one there to knock the door. This movie remind me of him and delivered a very special message.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-10,"I was pleasantly surprised because this movie was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è  There was laughter and tears but most of all it was heartwarming. Tom Hanks and all the other actors gave wonderful performances. If you get the opportunity, definitely watch this movie, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Cheers ü•Ç"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-27,The trailer reminds me so much of my own dad. His personality was very much like otto. I cant wait to see the film and reminisce of the times I‚Äôve spent around him.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-02-13,This movie is a masterpiece .  Tom Hanks at his best and all the actors demonstrated true talent. I‚Äôm thankful there are still movies written and produced showing good in this crazy world.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-10,I watched 12 minutes and turned it off but idk something made me turn it back on and am I glad I did! This is a movie everyone should watch once!
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-26,"Can&#39;t wait for this, not many people know this, but A Man called Ove was originally a series of blog posts by Fredrik Backman before he became a famous author, the blogs about Ove were very popular in Sweden long before I think even Fredrik was thinking about making it into a book. <br>We all have a piece of Ove within us and I think that&#39;s what makes him such a relatable character, the book and the movie is so heartfelt you&#39;d have to be dead inside not to feel it....the trailer looks awesome, Tom Hanks is perfect for this role."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-07-11,"My brother passed away a year and a half ago. He was 33 and I‚Äôm only a year older than him. It was devastating to say the least. There was a life before my brother and a life after. Just like Otto I‚Äôve been living angry with no sense of reality in a way. It is hard to hear people say that my brother would want me to live life idk, I feel like I‚Äôm disappointing him in a way. üò¢<br>I haven‚Äôt cried this much watching a movie specially thinking of my little brother. The movie has a wonderful but powerful message that I‚Äôm trying to grasp onto."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-07,"All be darn, I started crying watching this wonderful movie.  Tom Hanks has done it again"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-11-07,"Just watched this. If you need comedy, don&#39;t watch it. If you need to cry, perfect movie for that. Great movie either way."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-14,Tom Hanks nails it again! Great movie. It has been such a joy to have been able to see this great actor&#39;s evolution as we grow old together. His son plays a younger him.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-31,I&#39;m like crying already and it&#39;s only the trailer!!!!  hahaha.   I FREAKING LOVE TOM HANKS!!
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-19,"My mother and I saw the original Swedish film and loved it. As much as I adore Tom Hanks, I have to think about seeing the remake."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-07-20,Cant stop crying..reminds me of my parents..and myself..and same goes to others..we just have to do good in the world..afterlife is forever..hoping to see my loves there‚Ä¶.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-11,"Just finished watching this movie. Currently bawling my eyes but still wanted to express how much this movie touched me. It‚Äôs such a beautiful movie. I could feel the love, care that marisol had for Otto and the way otto healed in the end but still passed away just right when he started to wanting to live‚òπÔ∏è"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-04-29,I have read and seen every adaptation of this story. It makes you think about life and cry without fail every time.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-22,"This movie is not about story, action, twist and turns but about feeling and smile on your face while watching it ‚ô•Ô∏è"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-10-15,"For an egoistic person like me, this ‚Äúotto‚Äù perfectly portrays me. Sometimes the grumpy side of us, egoistic people, we scare to love again cz we scare to be disappointed in life so we tend to make space with others"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-11-09,I read ‚Äúa man called ove‚Äù years ago and absolutely loved it. I‚Äôve read several other books by Fredrick Backman after and they are always lovely. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-26,I&#39;m definitely going to cry again. It&#39;s a thing for Tom Hanks to make me cry.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-01,"I&#39;ve  just watched this movie,  I was crying and smiling the whole time. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-09-04,"Having not read the book, it feels this movie has been filmed so masterfully, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. I couldn&#39;t stop tears start welling up in my eyes every 5 minutes of those two hours. Every scene was right on point. Man, Otto...."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-15,"the whole story about the principle of the environment, friendship and even with his wife, 99% is very similar to my father who is gone. makes me keep repeating this story, in order to cure my longing for my father. but I can&#39;t stop crying afterwards. I hope mom and dad are in peace there with God, and hopefully God will call me soon so we can be together again.amin"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-16,"Watched the movie and cried a bucket. Otto and my father has a similar story. When my mother died, my father stopped living. Right after my mother&#39;s 40th day, my father followed her in heaven.üò≠"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-12-30,"My favorite scene in the Swedish movie version is when Ove tries to hang himself and the rope breaks, so he takes the rope back to the store to get his money back."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-04-24,Every role Tom Hanks takes he makes his own. I&#39;ve never been able to picture anyone else in that part.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-10,Ok I cried üò¢like a baby. I loved it tom hanks you are awesome.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-06-14,It was on sale 5$ at the Xbox marketplace. My first thought was ‚Äúthis is so predictable.‚Äù By the time the film ended I hadn‚Äôt cried that hard since I was a kid and ET went up in the spaceship. Loved it!
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-21,I cried so much!!!!! Wow! Beautiful movie and beautiful message-<br>We all need community and a sense of purposeüíõ be ready to cry!!!!
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-08-21,There are very few movies that you just know you&#39;ll remember all your life and will keep in your heart forever.  This is one of them.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-06,Just watched this and cried more than once. It is an excellent movie. Beautiful twists and turns.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-01-25,This gives me a nostalgic feeling about going out to see a movie in the 90s. It didnt have to be a blockbuster just a fun night of  &quot;going to the movies&quot; like we used to say.
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-18,"This movie is literally the live action version of the first 5 mins of Up. If that scene made you cry, then have a tissue box near by. Such a good movie!"
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2025-04-03,"This is a great movie. No gratuitous violence or sex...a solid, bitter sweet story that gives you lots to think about. Thank you, Mr. Hanks for yet another terrific interpretation and delivery.<br>I LOVED IT."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-05-12,I laughed more than I cried at this movie.. I absolutely LOVED IT
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2022-10-20,"Tom what a great actor, this man has nailed every role that he has acted on. a true legend, can&#39;t wait to see this movie."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2024-07-23,"What a spectacular movie, Tom hanks always entertains. Luv‚Äôd it.-a must see movie for everyone. If u have a loved one that passed or cat lover or live alone."
A Man Called Otto,eFYUX9l-m5I,2023-12-06,"What a brilliant movie. Tom Hanks portrays every role with such convincement. I cried in most of his movies, and the tears rolled in this one, too. He is much respected here in South Africa."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-14,her personality down to the way she speaks and her expressions are identical to like every disney protagonist we‚Äôve had since tangled. is this not exhausting to anyone?
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,I actually don‚Äôt think the king is wrong in not granting every wish‚Ä¶ curious to see where Disney takes this.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,I hope she learns that everyone getting everything they want all the time isn&#39;t always what&#39;s best for anyone. Looks cozy!
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-01-04,"Villain: I WISH TO RULE THE WORLD!!! MUAH HAHAAHAAAA<br>King: Yeaaah, not happening.<br>Asha: How dare you not grant a wish!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-16,Giving the villain a crazy look every now and then won&#39;t make people hate him. Dude literally has a point.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-07,"Who else is rooting for the king?<br>It would be a crazy twist that I‚Äôm all for.<br>People shouldn‚Äôt get everything they want, that would be a horrible message. Especially for kids."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,"You know, even though the king seems like the villain I think he‚Äôs probably right that granting everyone‚Äôs wishes would be a bad thing."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-13,The quirky ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù princess protagonist. Very original.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"please Disney, make this film a classic.  we want to see more fairy tales, this is your gift in creating stories"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-28,"The King is the real hero of this story. Not everybody should get what they want. If that happened then the world would be over. Whats best for the people is best for the kingdom, and sometimes people don&#39;t want whats best for them."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-21,"It&#39;s a worrying sign, that the trailer makes me agree with the &quot;bad guy&quot; and root for him.<br>But hopefully they will provide us a nuanced story about why not everyone gets their wish, but from the trailer I 100% agree with the king."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-26,When the main character is the villain
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,"So this King has the power to grant wishes, uses it to control his Kingdom and give it peace, but since he‚Äôs only granting the wishes that won‚Äôt cause problems he‚Äôs the bad guy, but his daughter awakens the same ability and now she not only threatens him but wants to use her powers to grant every wish even if that might not be good"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,"It looks better than a lot of what disneys been putting out, but im not convinced the villain is THAT evil and I&#39;m worried the message is gonna just be &quot;do what feels right no matter the consequences&quot;"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-18,Imagine if Disney made a real hand-drawn movie again.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-01-06,‚ÄúMy butt found it.‚Äù <br>Is that supposed to be a joke? It hardly even qualifies as one.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-27,"A lot animators verified to have worked on this movie while keeping their anonymity have said working on this film was horrible and depressing. It started off a totally different film, and people from corporate kept making them change things until it was dull and lifeless. Disney is OVER. They&#39;ve completely lost the magic they once had."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,I watched this and was very confused how I was supposed to view the king as a bad guy. Granting every wish without restriction sounds like a bad idea. Not everyone has good intentions.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,Honestly I‚Äôm loving how there‚Äôs a villain that‚Äôs established so early rather than a twist one.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-20,"I&#39;m rooting for the &quot;villain&quot;. If we all got what we wanted, then this world would be chaotic"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,Disney achieves the impossible and makes the protagonist the antagonist and the villian is most likely the hero of the story.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-25,I‚Äôm actually rooting for the antagonist this time
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"Yes!!! Disney is finally back with fairytales with musical numbers, a powerful villain, magic, animal sidekick, and the Princess. This is where Disney shines in creative storytelling."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-11,The king is actually the protagonist you can‚Äôt keep granting wishes without repercussions
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-09,Sick of Disney‚Äôs ‚Äúquirky‚Äù humor. We haven‚Äôt had a mature but interesting and unique female protagonist since Tiana.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-10,"I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this. I&#39;m definitely excited to have a real villain again, but I&#39;m also disappointed that we seem to be getting more of the &#39;haha whoops I&#39;m so awkward!&#39; type of humour that&#39;s really starting to get old. Hopefully they&#39;ve just crammed all of those moments into the trailer to grab attention and in the actual film they&#39;re spaced out and more subtle.<br><br>Definitely going to see it, cautiously hoping for good things!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-04,My wish is Disney would make one good film again.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-10-09,"&quot;Mom, can we watch a Disney movie?&quot;<br>&quot;We&#39;ve got Disney movie at home.&quot;<br>The Disney movie:"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-14,"The King doesn&#39;t just have a point, he should be the real hero. If everyone deserved to be granted everything their hearts desired, then that would mean that you&#39;d have to grant such wishes as a genocidal maniac wanting to destroy entire peoples, or evil advisors wanting to usurp the throne and become the most powerful sorcerer in the universe."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-22,"Anyone remember Bruce all mighty, when he found out how bad it was to say &quot;yes to all&quot; when answering everyone&#39;s prayers?"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"I love that the whole film looks like it‚Äôs literally coming from a painting, (very much like how Sleeping Beauty looks) and it also helps that it is filmed in CinemaScope"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-26,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a villain in this story, the girl is not mature and doesn‚Äôt understand why everyone can‚Äôt have what they want when they want, she gets the power to make it happen and then Realize that it can be an issue and will try to fix it and finally understand why the king didn‚Äôt want to grant everyone‚Äôs wish"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-01,"Very interesting concept for a movie. The King is not wrong in that not everyone should have their wishes granted. While he may be stopping wishes that would undermine his power, there is a good chance that granting all wishes would cause utter chaos. Not to mention if you could just wish for anything, what is even the point of living? A life with no hardships and no challenges would diminish a person&#39;s chance for growth and make all accomplishments meaningless. I get the feeling that the ending will be something like &quot;only those who are truly good or pure of heart will get their wishes granted.&quot; Another option would be &quot;only those who wish on the correct star will have their wishes granted&quot; since maybe there&#39;s only one true wishing star."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,The really made the &#39;villian&quot; the voice of reason
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-24,"The king isn‚Äôt wrong in not granting every wish, in reality it‚Äôs true that not everyone should get what they want. I‚Äôm excited for this movie"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-05-07,Finally watched the movie. Asha wasn‚Äôt even fighting for people to have their wishes granted. She wanted them to have their dreams and aspirations back. Which is what a wish is. Sure he did say what would happen when he takes their wish but it left many with nothing to aspire to. The king was too afraid to give them back when he could. To afraid of the possibilities. She never asked for him to make the wishes happen or he‚Äôs bad. She thought people should be able to hold on to those wishes and the feeling that comes with them. He basically nurtured them by taking away their memories of what they wanted to be become in life
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-28,When you&#39;ve made the &quot;villain&quot; more relatable and likeable the intended protagonist you&#39;ve written an ineffective story.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-19,She sounds and looks exactly like every other girl in every other Disney movie
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,This looks pretty good and the villain looks like he won‚Äôt be a tragic one which is good we need classic Disney villains back
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-01-06,The king is very wise and she&#39;s actually the villian lmao
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-22,"Man I love girl protagonist, she sure is completely new, and not an overused character archetype Disney has been recycling for decades."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-15,Arianna: Everbody should have their wish granted! Not just the one&#39;s you choose!<br><br>King: One guy wished for women to be obedient slaves.<br><br>Arianna:...<br><br>King: Another wished for some guy who bumped into him to have cancer.<br><br>Arianna:...<br><br>King: So you gonna question why i choose to grant certain wishes or do you want me to continue? Because i got a whole list here
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,I&#39;m incredibly excited to see this film
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-09-26,When You Watch Wish Trailer That You Order From Wish:
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,I&#39;m with the king.  People wish for stupid things and they should figure out how to do things for themselves.  Curious how much this one will lose.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,So‚Ä¶ the villain is the guy who wants to make sure wishes are safe for the kingdom?
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"Okay, ngl, this movie looks way more promising than I previously expected, and I love the blended 2D/3D animation style they&#39;re using for this. It looks so clean and fluid and I wouldn&#39;t mind if it was used again in a future Disney film."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-01-03,I wish this movie didn&#39;t exist
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,I believe her wish is that everyone‚Äôs wish comes true. That‚Äôs why her animal friend started talking. <br><br>I bet some people had horrible wishes that caused chaos to her village and she needed to find a way to undo her wish and save everyone.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,"I&#39;m curious to see what actually makes the king a villain. I mean, sure, he&#39;s not exactly nice and is full of himself, but not granting every single wish? I don&#39;t see the problem. Things could get out of control fast if he granted every one"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,"Ngl, the trailer doesn‚Äôt really make the king seem too bad? Like, he‚Äôs controlling, but the citizens seem happy. And it‚Äôs definitely a good thing that not everyone‚Äôs wish is granted-"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-04-07,I think people are missing the point of the movie. They say that Asha was selfish and the true villain. But she just wanted to return the wish to her Saba bc it belonged to him (regardless if it came true or not) and King Magnifico confessed he was never going to grant her Saba‚Äôs wish. There was no reason for Magnifico to hold on to the wish if he didn‚Äôt plan to make it come true.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-07,"I&#39;m rooting for the &quot;villain&quot; this time, he&#39;s got a point. The protagonist is an immature girl who thinks her wishes must be fulfilled every time no matter what, otherwise you&#39;re oppressing her."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-30,"I like how our protagonist already has a clear flaw: she throws caution to the wind without thinking of consequences, it‚Äôs a lesson she has to learn throughout the film<br><br>Edit: I never meant to imply that idealism isn‚Äôt a good thing, just that quick actions can get someone into dangerous situations, it‚Äôs a flaw if it puts her and her people in danger or has the potential to do so"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-02,"I don&#39;t know how the people are in this movie but having everyone&#39;s wishes granted in real life would be an epic disaster. Also, sometimes in life you don&#39;t get what you want but you get what you need. Hope that&#39;s the message this movie conveys."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-14,Oh Disney. You&#39;ve learned nothing in the last few years of flops.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-30,"Just a few years ago, the character with the message that people shouldn&#39;t always get what they want would be the wise and insightful character, revealing at the climax what a beautiful life it is not to get everything people want. It&#39;s no wonder there&#39;s no real emotional pull in this trailer. Not even a smile."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-26,Disney is like what if we make rapunzel but the villain have a point and is right in the story
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-21,I wish Disney could go back and make good movies!
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-16,well what a way to ruin your 100 aniversary celebration
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,I want this to be good so badly. The art looks lovely. The goat is absolutely adorable. It‚Äôs giving old Disney but I‚Äôm afraid of getting too excited.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-30,Isn&#39;t the villain kinda right tho? You can&#39;t just be granting everyone&#39;s wishes
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"This looks so amazingly beautiful, and I would expect nothing less from the film dedicated to Disney‚Äôs centennial!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-09-27,"After watching the movie, I can only say‚Ä¶ WHY, DISNEY?! WHY DID YOU TAKE STAR BOY AND ASHA‚ÄôS LOVE STORY FROM US IN THE MOVIE?!!! Just WHY??? üò≠üò≠üò≠ It could‚Äôve been so gooood üò¢"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-23,"I really miss the old days of romance in a movie. That was fun, especially if done right. I enjoyed Mulan and Shang together, would&#39;ve even loved more scenes of them together in the movie. I also loved Aladdin and Jasmine together in the original movie. I Wish they would go back to that for at least some of their movies, instead of turning away entirely and acting like women who want love are weak lol"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-01,"i like relatable characters but sometimes i want to see the characters who make you go, ‚Äúwow, they aren‚Äôt me at all, but that‚Äôs the type of person i want to be.‚Äù"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-10-01,"I&#39;m interested to see how this movie deals with wishes. Not every wish can be granted, after all if 2 people have opposing desires, only 1 wish can come true."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"I like that it looks very 2D despite it being a 3D animated movie, and not just because of the art style, but the framing and positions of the characters against the background looks similar to how a lot of 2D animations looks. It&#39;s like 2.5D...<br><br>Some shots almost looked like pictures in a storybook coming to life.<br><br>Edit: I also want to point out how this movie seems to truly be a celebration of Disney as a whole. It&#39;s got the storybook feel of old Disney like Sleeping Beauty. It has animal sidekicks and a (hopefully) interesting and fun villain like the renaissance era, it has the 3D animation and energy of modern Disney, and the music is very modern Disney. All that&#39;s missing is the romance, which has been missing from Disney for far too long"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-30,Princess Asha seems like the real villain in this story.<br>Not every one&#39;s wish deserves to be granted.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"This film looks like it came from a classic fairy tale book. Now, I came into this world 13 years ago, and I love this type of visuals. I am actually might cry watching this movie. Disney, happy 100 year anniversary!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-15,The princess is the villian in this movie. Her idea making everyone wish come true without having to work for it. Another Woke disney movie
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,This movie better not be a disappointment. Ariana DeBose deserves the world and it makes me so happy that she&#39;s gonna be the next Disney princess.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,This feels very old school Disney with a touch of modern animation in the mix. This looks good and I love the new princess.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"King Magnifico is giving some serious Ursula + Evil Queen + Gaston vibes. That&#39;s how you know he&#39;s going to be a great Disney Villain. Though Asha seems like a carbon copy of Anna, Rapunzel and Moana with the way she speaks and her expressions. <br><br>Edit- The villain sucked and so did the movie."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-16,‚ÄúMy butt found it.‚Äù That is now my favourite sentence
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw&amp;t=142"">2:22</a> best part of the trailer!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,I love the look of this film. It feels like they&#39;re taking a lot of inspiration from their old 2d films.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,"I&#39;m 50/50 on it. At least it&#39;s something different, and while it may not revolutionize Disney&#39;s current low standing in Cinema it&#39;s a step in the right direction."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-08-02,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw&amp;t=26"">0:26</a> Dahlia: my best friend, the king&#39;s apprentice"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"I‚Äôm beyond stoked for this one. Asha is gorgeous and seems totally charming, the goat is SO CUTE!!!<br>I hope Asha joins the official Disney Princess lineup, it‚Äôs only fitting the girl from the 100 Anniversary celebration film would be apart of that."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"Is it wrong to say I already have a crush on King Magnifico? Hearing Chris Pine‚Äôs voice made me more hyped for his movie! Also, Asha is giving me Mirabel and Rapunzel vibes, which I love. Valentino is cute and hilarious."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-27,"Hey Disney, I have a GREAT idea for a movie. <br><br>It&#39;s about a fish named Charlie, and what Charlie wants is to be a bird. Charlie spends the whole movie trying to be something he&#39;s not. Charlies friends all sit him down and break it to him he&#39;ll never be a bird. Charlie can&#39;t accept this so he angrily leaves his friends behind and embarks on a journey to become a bird. Through a whole lot of &quot;cutesy&quot; scenes and many emotionally charged scenes he ends up meeting a bird named Myrle. Myrle promises him he will teach him how to fly. More laughs, and more marketable characters later Charlie and Myrle end up on top of the Empire State Building where Charlie will learn to fly, like he always dreamed. Myrle, our protagonist&#39;s best friend in the world who was at his side for the last 90 minutes encourages Charlie that Charle can do anything they put their minds to. Myrle tips over Charlies bowl and and our little fish friend starts to fall. Charlie is flapping his fins with all his might when...... SPLAT. Charlie splatters on the sidewalk. Screen goes black, letters pop up that say, &quot;Fish can&#39;t fly, stupid.&quot; Then &quot;You Can&#39;t Always Get What You Want&quot; by the Rolling Stones starts playing ROLL END CREDITS.<br><br>Call it &quot;FLOP&quot;"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-22,Guy&#39;s the &quot;villain &quot;because he alone chooses what wishes are good and reasonable  and is seeking an apprentice to help.<br><br>The movie ends with said apprentice revolting and becoming the lone person to grant wishes <br>üòÖ
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-28,"I&#39;m actually interested in seeing this. It looks ORIGINAL, for once, and it&#39;s nice to see something that&#39;s not a live-action remake of a perfectly good animated film that doesn&#39;t need to be remade, or a spin-off, prequel or sequel of an existing film. Maybe this can be the film that helps Disney to regain the creativity and brilliance it used to have, because it&#39;s really been in a slump lately!"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-11-28,arts beautiful in this movie 100% but  the message that everyone is entitled to everything they want without even questioning the consequences is crazy to me.  Very on brand for you Disney slip those little msgs in your movies ;)
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> That sentence was <i>this</i> close to being perfect"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-01-20,"To all the people that hate the trailer ‚Äî Watch the movie.<br><br> It‚Äôs not what you think, and the king is definitely not the hero.. <br><br>It‚Äôs not someone else‚Äôs right to withhold a persons wish, dream, or what they want for their life; it‚Äôs up to the person to make it happen. <br><br>It‚Äôs a great concept of a movie. Sure, it could have been much better done, but it‚Äôs a decent message. <br><br>Wayyyy better than frozen or sleeping beauty, or some other weak movie that pushes the idea that you get something for nothing <br><br>This says ‚Äòif it‚Äôs a persons wish, it‚Äôs up to the person to make it happen, NOT someone else‚Äô <br><br>I think it‚Äôs a great message, and would much rather my daughter watch this than a lot of other Disney movies"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-29,The fact that her name is &quot;Asha&quot; which in my language means &quot;A wish&quot; it just makes it so much better ‚ú®Ô∏è‚úãÔ∏è
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"This movie actually looks pretty decent. Asha looks like a good, cute, charming, loveable protagonist and the goat voiced by Alan Tudyk is hilarious. üêê‚ú®üíú"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,I‚Äôve never been more ready for an actual villain. Thank you Disney üò≠
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-06-12,I&#39;m rooting for the king since he doesn&#39;t want to grant all wishes because of the consequences that the bad types of wishes will cause.
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"I&#39;m loving so much of what I&#39;m seeing. The hero vs villain story, the painterly computer animation, the music, the Eyvind Earle approach in the forest backgrounds, the voice acting. I&#39;m predicting this to be high up in my Disney Animation ranking! I can&#39;t wait to see it! I love it all so much I would&#39;ve loved to work on it."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"Oh yes. This is the Disney we missed. A fairy tale feature that involves a protagonist, a comedic animal buddy, and of course, a straight forward villain who is evil! I&#39;m so ready for November."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-30,"Issue is that the villain here is correct. You cannot give everyone exactly what they want, it will hurt too many.<br>For example, what if someone wishes to have all the wishes to themselves and then uses them to become a ruthless tyrant? There might be rules in place, but we will have to wait for the movie to come out to know that."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-12-20,"Oh look another man who has responsibility and accountability, and a woman who has neither but thinks she knows better because she is too immature to understand how the world works.<br><br>Disney really is stupid with this movie."
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"Something about the song is giving me chills. Like a feeling the child in me longs to feel. Great Job, Disney! ‚ù§"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,I hope you guys give this movie a chance and watch it in cinemas instead of just waiting for its Disney Plus release. Wish deserves to be successful!
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,"This reminds me of the classic disney movies. It&#39;s beautiful, funny and magical. It&#39;s a wonderful way to celebrate 100 years of Disney magic"
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2024-05-21,Fun fact: ‚ÄòAsha‚Äô the main character‚Äôs name literally translates to ‚Äòwish‚Äô in an Indian language called Telugu
Wish,oyRxxpD3yNw,2023-09-27,It‚Äôs pretty awesome that she has a lot of friends then just one or none

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"Once again, remember that Ridley Scott is 85 years old and is still directing epics."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-06-09,"The trailer was so good , that I was so excited for the movie. The team that did the trailer deserves worthy praise. The movie not so much, what a disappoitment."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,Ridley bringing back historical epics!!!!<br>Please let this be the full 4 hour director cut. You can‚Äôt contain Napoleon in just 2 hours

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-14,There are millions of amazing historical events and stories that would be awesome to see portrayed in the movies. It‚Äôs shame only a few directors have the ability to make such films and are willing. Id be watching movies all the time if studios decided to fund these kinds of films rather than another superhero movie or a non original reboot. Historical epics are hard to beat!

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-20,"Oppenheimer from Nolan, Dune: Part 2 from Villenueve, and Napoleon from Ridley Scott. What an epic year for epics this is! Cinema was on life support, but these three directors are refusing to let it die!"

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-20,"My only concern is, how the hell do you capture a career like Napoleon&#39;s in one movie? Over a period of 25 years, he literally led one of the most interesting lives in history, during one of the most interesting times in history. <br><br>Countless movies and miniseries have focussed on just a few aspects of his life, and the French Revolution that precipitated his rise to power. More books have been written about him than about anyone else, ever."

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"Yes, yes, and yes. Bring back the historic epics genre to front of cinema. Classic already"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"Each generation should have a Napoleonic movie, this story is so enormous you could tell it a hundred different times and it would still be mind boggling."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2025-01-01,"You know, I had a feeling this was going to be one of those movies where the trailer was better than the actual film."

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-01-14,This trailer is such a banger compared to end result..
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,Such poetic that Joaquin Phoenix plays again the role of an Emperor 23 years later the first time Ridley Scott directed him.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"For Ridley Scott to be in his 80s and still making these energetic epics just showcases that age is truly a number. He, George Miller, and Martin Scorsese still putting out cinematic epics in their older ages."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,I&#39;m glad there&#39;s still a market for these epic type of films. Especially when it&#39;s done by Ridley Scott.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-06-07,When the trailer was better than the actual movie!

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"&quot;My enemies are many, my equals are none.&quot; <br><br>As a NTW enjoyer this has to be one of the most exciting trailer drops of the year"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,If this is done right it&#39;s a in theater experience for sure. Napoleon as a subject or protagonist has massive potential
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-12-26,Why do people dislike the movie. <br>It literally tell us their historical story based on napoleon.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-09-22,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing we can do‚Äù
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,YES YES YES. Finally the Napoleonic era is getting a little bit of the attention it deserves!
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-13,"As someone who is obsessed with history, I cannot express how excited I am to see this movie!<br>And they honestly could not have picked a better director!<br>I hope this doesn&#39;t let me down!"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-03-11,Two emperors the king of war and the king of epics clashed. One met his Waterloo and the other another Oscar.<br><br>RS can do no wrong!<br><br>Fantastic movie.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,Joaquin is PERFECT for this role AND NOT because of his stature but he has that death stare that is depicted in so many Napoleon portraits.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,This film better be atleast 3 hour long considering how much they need to condense in one movie
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-16,"The most mind-boggling thing about Buonaparte was he was able to defeat 4 armies in 6 days with an army less than half the size of his foes, and this happened in the twilight period of his career in the Seine valley."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-12-24,"&gt;Make a movie about Napoleon <br>&gt;Concentrate on his lover instead<br>great idea, I can&#39;t wait for a movie called Hitler but instead of concentrating on ww2 or his rise to power and downfall it would concentrate on his relationship with Eva Braun, and only at the end would there be a 10-minute fight with the Soviets or a movie called Lenin but instead of being about Russian Revolution it would only consist of his story with Nadezhda Krupskaya"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,‚ÄúI‚Äôm the first one to admit when I make a mistake. I simply never do‚Äù<br><br>Epic
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,‚ÄúI‚Äôm the first to admit when I make a mistake. I simply never do.‚Äù That‚Äôs one bone-chilling line.
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"Napolen fought about 60 battles during his career, he won 52 of them a phenomenal success rate probably without equal throughout history, the film looks amazing."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-12-30,movie of a historical figure drops: I sleep üò¥ <br><br>There&#39;s a radiohead song on the trailer: Real Shit?
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-16,"As a French I&#39;m certain of one thing : in my country, this movie will touch everyone, for the better and for the worse."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-20,"Fun fact, Napoleon was so good at logistics that during his time in exile on Elba, he oversaw massive infrastructure projects like building new road networks, farms and draining marshes. He even opened new mines (along with retrofitting old ones) and overhauled the islands schools and legal system."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-15,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm the first to admit when I make a mistake, I simply never do‚Äù sent shivers to my spine"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-03-01,"Despite the criticism that the movie has received, and it being for the most part valid, I think the movie was great. I left the cinema with my breath still heavy from the scene of The Battle of Austerlitz and my heart still in my throat from the scene of The Battle of Waterloo. While it might have not been as historically accurate and battle-oriented as this trailer suggested and we expected, it did Napoleon‚Äôs legacy justice with that exact feeling of shortness of breath and your heart in your throat. The movie was exceptionally made.  Wonderfully cast, fantastically acted by Joaquin, phenomenally scored with tracks perfectly fitting. The cinematography of the film kept me in awe with each new set introduced and the realism of each and every single gory detail never failed to make gasp at least a little. <br>The film might have not told Napoleon‚Äôs story perfectly accurate, but it did get the greatness of his legacy across. And I think, that for the people that do not have as much historical knowledge to be able to point each inaccuracy out and ruin it for them, this movie showcased the great impact of Napoleon enough. A great movie for a great leader."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-13,&quot;Only Joaquin Phoenix shall do justice to my role&quot;<br>       - Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a soldier. I fight where I‚Äôm told, and I win where I fight‚Äù<br><br>-Napoleon"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-08-17,"That last battle on the ice really drew me in.<br><br>The Battle of Austerlitz/of the Three Emperors was one of the greatest masterpieces of Napoleon&#39;s service career, but he wouldn&#39;t get to see such successes as the rest of Europe saw him as a more and more serious threat."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-02-02,&quot;Death is inutile if you are remembered in the hearts of men.&quot; -Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"There is a reason why mostly everyone knows or recognizes who Napoleon is, he impacted our world forever.  This film looks EPIC!"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"from Commodus in Gladiator, Johnny Cash in Walk The Line, to Joker and now as Napoleon, damn! we believe in Joaquin Phoenix supremacy!"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"With Scott at the helm and Joaquin as the legend itself, i have full confidence this movie will prove to be a hell of a good watch"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-11-21,This trailer is a cinematic masterpiece
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,&quot;The problem with quotes on the internet is that you can&#39;t always be sure of their authenticity&quot; - Napoleon
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-12,‚ÄúVictory belongs to the most persevering.‚Äù- Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-08-15,"Did hesitate to watch it because of reviews, but it is extremely good.<br>New generation has different values and therefore, the movie may not get good critics, but it is good.<br>Different times, different society and behaviour.<br>It shows Napoleon as a whole not just general and emperor and the importance of heir and a woman one choses...<br>All in all great movie."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-15,"For those who don&#39;t know who napoleon is:<br>He was a normal boy<br>He became a general<br>After a coup he became an emperor<br>He fought multiple nations seven times<br>And came out victorious<br>He lost one of the wars, got sent to Alba and when everybody thought it was all over.<br><br>He came back!!"

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-10-08,Remember when everyone thought this movie was going to be good?
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"‚ÄúThe world suffers a lot. Not because of the violence of bad people, but because of the silence of good people.‚Äù<br>Napoleon Bonaparte"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"This came out of nowhere... and looks incredible.  As a historical figure, Napoleon is quite worthy of this sort of Hollywood treatment.  I&#39;m surprised it took this long to get it, but am happy we&#39;re here."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"&quot;I saw the Emperor ‚Äì this world-soul ‚Äì riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&quot; - Georg Hegel"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-07-04,I don‚Äôt know why everyone is hating this movie for me it was a perfect movie and a treat to watch for war history genre movie fan
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,This movie can easily be the movie of the year! Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix together is always a masterpiece. Simple as that!
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-12,Man I didn‚Äôt know the Napoleonic Wars had such a great soundtrack. I‚Äôm glad historians were able to uncover this!
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-10,"Napoleon is one of histories greatest conquerors, it‚Äôs truly shocking how little he‚Äôs been explored in media entertainment."

Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-07-11,"Finally a movie that would make me go back to a theatre, it looks epic"
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-08-20,"This looks so good. I&#39;m especially excited to see how they will portray his coronation. I think the huge painting depicting the event is one of the most impressive works of art ever, and from what I see in the trailer, it&#39;s gonna be a well made sequence."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2024-03-05,"One of Napoleon&#39;s best films, a very beautiful film."
Napoleon,OAZWXUkrjPc,2023-09-29,I read about napoleon as a child. I understood only one thing about this man. He was ready to do anything required to achieve his goals. And that&#39;s a man to be inspired of.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"OK, this might be better than the first movie. Shazam seems to be like a hero that reacts to all the madness like a normal person"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,Good to see Shazam joining the Eminem Cinematic Universe along with the Minions and Venom
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Loved the first movie. Cannot wait to see the sequel. Zachary Levi is brilliant as Shazam and he was brilliant when he was Chuck.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-12-16,"I really do hope that this Shazam is kept in the new plans of James Gunn, because from all the superhero movies DC made in the last years, this adaptation not only feels accurate to the character, but it really has place to grow, in difference with the other ones that just kinda ends there."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,So uh‚Ä¶ Anyone else notice the Annabelle doll in this?  <br><br>Also‚Ä¶ here for Rachel Zegler shining so bright in every way üò≠ This looks 10/10!
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"I loved the original movie, this looks like a promising sequel. And we got legends like Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu playing the villains.üëåüëç"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Super honoured and proud to be a part of a team that contributed to the Visual Effects work on this !  Everything looks amazing! Can&#39;t wait to watch the movie!
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-12-18,"The casting for adult Shazam just feels so spot on, especially in this trailer"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Shazam returns, so glad that we got another movie cause this was one of my favorites from a few years ago."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Pretty much what happens when a fan becomes a hero. Also love that there&#39;s nothing stronger than family.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,The VFX and cinematography is such an upgrade from the first film love this
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-12-18,I want this to succeed.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-25,"I LOVE what DC is doing with their superhero movies. Each hero has a different tone and personality, so their movie should reflect that! Batman is dark, Wonder Woman is graceful, Aquaman is badass, Flash is impulsive, Superman is optimistic, and Shazam is childish.<br>..Since a lot of y&#39;all been asking for Black Adam, first of all Black Adam ain&#39;t a superhero. According to the live-action movie, he&#39;s an Anti-hero.  Born as a slave since 2000BC, witnessed violence &amp; death on a regular basis so of course he won&#39;t feel remorse for the villains he has to kill.  So...Black Adam is a ruthless OG!!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"One thing I liked here is that they added little details to the costumes of shazam and his brothers, without it being overcrowded and not looking that simple either, so excited for this movie."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-03-17,Just saw it and it FREAKING rules! This movie does not deserve the hate!
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"This looks great. Really enjoyed the first one. Shazam&#39;s enthusiasm and earnestness really sets him and his family apart from most other superheroes, especially on the DC side."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-25,I love how the Wizard really believes in Billy. It really humanizes him.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,This makes me actually wanna go back and watch the first one I was expecting maybe a black Adam tease but I feel that‚Äôs for the post credit scene and even still I‚Äôm super hype. Dc actually is making a promising live action superhero movie.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Zachary Levi is the most perfect casting for Shazam like Ryan Reynolds was for Deadpool. Born to play him. ü§ó
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Never thought I would see the day that Eminem&#39;s music is in a DC movie trailer, especially material from his younger days üòÜ"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-12-21,Love the comic book accurate costumes in the 2nd movie
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Feels like it‚Äôs been such a long time since the first film. I love this trailer so much, everyone already has great chemistry, but new suits, bigger budget, DC is making a comeback and I&#39;m all for it"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Did anyone else notice the Annabelle doll at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi88i4CpHe4&amp;t=54"">0:54</a>. This Easter Egg was in Aquaman and the first Shazam movie too. I love how they keep adding this Easter Egg in different DC movies!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Looks absolutely amazing! I loved the first movie and this looks like it‚Äôs going to be even better, can‚Äôt wait!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-03-19,"This movie was so fun, 7/10 for me. Very enjoyable and I liked the comedy. Not as good as the first but still a fun movie and it had lots of action. I cried at a few parts. I love that ending, I won‚Äôt spoil who shows up for anyone who is reading this and haven‚Äôt seen the movie yet, but I loved it. And Rachel Zegler is so pretty, I loved her in the movie"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Zachary Levi does such a good job as portraying a child and his adult self as the same time
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-25,"‚ÄúIntroducing the star of our show, his name is‚Äî‚Äú <i>SHAZAM!</i><br><br>I can‚Äôt stop rewatching that part"

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"You already know Zachary loves being Shazam and puts his heart and soul into the role. Also, man, David Sandberg, really has a vision which once again is potrayed in the whole trailer. Cant wait!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-08-30,"I&#39;m so glad Billy is still learning to control his powers, I think when you see a hero learn and grow throughout the movie that&#39;s the moment you connect with that hero as a person. Also I hope the entire team still acts like children and teenagers even after transforming like in the first movie."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-27,"I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the foster parents. They spent their lives helping children in true need: in the end, they created a superhero family.     They deserve they power of the Wizard"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-03-20,I watched this movie and it is the best movie ever! Incredible. I want more!
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,The fact that they literally made a Fast and Furious joke in front of Helen Mirren who literally played Shaw&#39;s mother üòÇüòÇ

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,I love this already! It has humor serious moments it stayed true to what made it good. It also states he has no experience with using his powers. It also has a good motivation behind it.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-04-22,"&#39;Hahahah I just threw a truck at a dragon, I love my life&#39;.. Spiderman version gosh this is so hilarious üòÇüòÇ"

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"I really hope they make a third movie because we want to see them not just fighting Dr.Sivana but also Mr.Mind and Dwayne Johnson&#39;s Black Adam,maybe even the Monster Society of Evil,too,they should also put Uncle Dudley either in the sequel or in the 3rd movie."

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-03-07,That &quot;It&#39;s all about family&quot; clip is one of the worst most eye-rolling moments I have ever seen in a movie trailer.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"The fact that Billy even questions his worthiness as a superhero only proves that he really is pure of heart like The Wizard had hoped<br><br>Sivana and Black Adam let the power get into their heads and would&#39;ve never even considered giving it up<br><br>EDIT: Well, turns out there&#39;s at least one circumstance that would make Black Adam relinquish his power"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,This looks 100% better than the first one.<br>Shazam was definitely one of my favorite movies back few years.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-02-17,I am so glad that another American super hero movie will save the world again. And by world I mean New York
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,That moment when you have been waiting for a moment and it finally arrives ‚ö°Ô∏è
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"The Suicide Squad and The Batman were great, Shazam 2 and Black Adam both look awesome too! I&#39;m happy to see DC successful too!<br>That&#39;s coming from a big Marvel fan üòå"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"I love how the DCEU is once again strengthening its continuity. Shazam! 2 addressing ZSJL, the Peacemaker JL cameos, Ben Affleck returning in The Flash, it all feels much more cohesive than a couple years ago. <br><br>Now if they could add Superman back into the mix...<br><br>edit... THEY DID!! ü§©ü§©ü§©"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-03-31,"They rarely mentioned superman who in almost every version of shazam idolises superman, superman is shazam&#39;s hero role model but no it had to make it all batman and wonder woman."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-31,"‚ÄúIntroducing the star of our show, his name is‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>Everyone: SHAZAM!!<br>Love that part! üòç<br>I‚Äôm a Marvel fan but Shazam is one of my favourite heroes from DC. Really keen on this movie!!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-10-21,Who is here after Watching Black Adam?? Now I have much more hype for this movie...DC is Back!!!
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-05-29,And people are complaining about Marvel movies being too goofy with their jokes and humor this movie was doing it over the limit
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi88i4CpHe4&amp;t=118"">1:58</a> so i guess the adoptive parents finally find out about the kid&#39;s powers."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Even though I‚Äôm a marvel fan by heart this looks like it‚Äôs gonna be way way better than any marvel project this year
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Zachary Levi is the only reason I&#39;ll watch every Shazam they ever make lol. The dude&#39;s attitude is infectious
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2024-08-29,Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler co-starred even way before Disney went bankrupt! ü§Ø
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-28,"Honestly im really impressed by Zachery, when i first heard his casting I was unsure. He nailed the first movie and this trailer, what it means to be a kid in an adult body."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Batfleck appearing was the top moment of the trailer for sure
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi88i4CpHe4&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> <br>Shazam : Family! <br>Dom : Here I Am üöòüòéüî•"

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,This looks really good definitely getting me hyped for the DCEU

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Coming from a Marvel fan, DC is starting to look good actually over the years, Shazam was a fantastic movie, aquaman was good, Joker was incredible, excited for Flash, Batman."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"As a marvel fan I have to say this trailer is awesome I cannot wait to watch this movie, DC nailed the first shazam movie and it looks like for the most part most of the original cast is back which is hard enough to do in a sequel marvel should take notice because lately their movies and TV series have not been good. So DC has a great opportunity and if they keep heading in this direction it won&#39;t be long before they overtake marvel."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen all the ‚ÄòFast and the Furious‚Äô movies, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre Shaw‚Äôs mother.‚Äù"

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-11-22,"After watching the movie, I dreamed that I could fly"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,I&#39;ve been waiting for this since the first movie. And I gotta say it doesn&#39;t disappoints. Everything looks cool and Billy BatsonüòÅ.
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Guess we can officially name this the year of Shazam!!, with Fury Of the Gods and Black Adam coming out this year!! Highly stoked for both movies!!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Shazam! (2019) was so good but it seems like Shazam! Fury of the Gods is gonna be 10x more amazing.<br>Really excited for the Shazam! family and especially Zachary Levi. Thanks a lot, David Sandberg and DC!"
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2023-04-08,I&#39;m absolutely shocked that no one during the writing of this film thought it was ridiculous that the hero would fight for the powers he received from the gods with the daughters of those same gods...lol
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,Man i just choked laughing at the family dialogueüòÇüòÇ that makes me wanna watch this movie ASAP

Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-23,"Adored the first film, arguably the best in the DCEU and this looks like another home run."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2024-08-17,"I remember first watching this trailer and being so hyped. I knew it would be fun to see Shazam back in action and having watched the film by now. I can confirm I was right. Also, that music is an absolute banger."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-07-24,"This really does look like what you&#39;d expect a comic book movie to look like, in the best of ways."
Shazam! Fury of the Gods,Zi88i4CpHe4,2022-10-25,They better be cooking up some crazy Black Adam and/or Superman cameos for this film.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"Tobin Bell is 80 years old but still playing this character perfectly, what a legend."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"‚Äúyou all pretended to cure me, but what I have planned for each of you is VERY real‚Äù gave me chills"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"No matter how many movies this franchise has, John Krammer&#39;s voice it&#39;s amazing and still gives me chills, Tobin Bell was born to be this character."

Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-31,"No matter how many films the series goes into, John Kramer&#39;s amazing voice still gives me the chills, and Tobin Bell was born for the role."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-31,Tobin Bell was born to be this character.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-11,"I got to meet Tobin Bell at a horror convention in NJ a few years back. He&#39;s one of the absolute sweetest guys I&#39;ve ever met. I was, like, 51, 52, and I was fan-girlling all over the place. So great to see him back in action. The Saw series doesn&#39;t work without him. Very much looking forward to this."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-01-30,"I don&#39;t know who thought to use &quot;Air that I Breathe&quot; by The Hollies, when Billy rides out on his tricycle, but it&#39;s absolutely perfect. I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s perfect. (Besides the ending, but it just works all around)"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,Tobin Bell is one of the best movie villains. His voice itself is enough to send chills üëå
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-12,Tobin Bell is one of the greatest horror movie actors and icons of all time. No one can convince me or tell me any different. He&#39;s up there with all the greats.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"Tobin Bell&#39;s voice never fails to send chills, its iconic and low-key scary üò≥"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-11-07,Watched Saw X in movie theaters! An amazing movie as always. Everyone in the theater was on the edge of their seat and invested in every second.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This genuinely feels like the old Saw films, and I absolutely love it!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-04,"At 80 years old, Tobin Bell is still giving us amazing performances as John Kramer. I&#39;m so happy they&#39;re going back to the roots and setting this right after the first movie. Can&#39;t wait."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-09,"&quot;Live or die, the choice is yours&quot; That line always gives me the chills"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-11-05,"I know this is a direct sequel to the first Saw (2004) and a prequel to Saw II. But I can somehow say, this is a good stand alone Saw film."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-01,This feels like a farewell to John and the original series. I‚Äôm so excited! Saw wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without Tobin Bell. He deserves a great send off to the character!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-31,I couldn&#39;t be more excited to see more of Tobin in the spotlight! He truly loves the character and made the role his own.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-12,"Crazy that the first SAW came out almost 2 decades ago! I remember the ending blew everyone&#39;s mind so bad, definitely a horror classic that will live on for generations!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-11-01,Im so so glad they are giving Tobin a full movie all to himself my god what an amazing actor. John Kramer is such a complex and misunderstood character that I could talk about for weeks. I loved the 3rd movie most for its complex story  telling (especially Amanda&#39;s character) so this one should be fun as hell.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-02,This looks like it was made in 2007. So glad the classic Saw vibe is back. Also Amanda taking the mask off is so cool.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This franchise is picking up its classic vibes again, the darkness, cinematography, lightning and brutality on its peak. Classic Saw vibes."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"No matter how many movies they make, I&#39;ll always watch them. Saw is my favorite horror franchise and I&#39;ll watch it until I die"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-04-10,Saw Xl has been postponed to September 2025. I hope that the film will be worth the wait. Don&#39;t let us down guys! Tobin Bell forever!<br><br>Added: The franchise ended on the beautiful finale of ‚ÄúSaw X‚Äù. The ‚ÄúSaw XI‚Äù movie has apparently been canceled.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This feels just like a classic Saw movie. Amanda‚Äôs back, the franchise‚Äôs signature chaotic editing is back, and apparently Hoffman‚Äôs back?? Get me in that theater on Day 1 for this one, PLEASE. I need this movie now."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This really feels like a classic Saw film, from the cinematography to the lighting, and I love it!!!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,The amount of stuff the writers are able to make this man do before and after his death is astonishing‚Ä¶
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-11-20,I saw the trailer as an ad and it started with ‚Äúthe cancer is spreading‚Äù so I thought this would be a story about living with a cancer diagnosis. But then they dropped the bomb ‚Äúyour whole life happens then‚Ä¶John Kramer‚Äù and then I was all ‚Äúoh shiiiiiiit!‚Äù Awesome trailer!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-06,"&quot;This is not retribution it&#39;s a re-awakening&quot; Tobin bell is the embodiment of fear when it comes to horror, got nothing but respect for the legend"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,This truly feels like the franchise is going back to it&#39;s roots and is benefiting from the absolute stunning colour grading and the early 2000s style effects that the older movies had. Really makes me personally feel as though Saw is back!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"From the cinematography, the style and writing, this feels right at home with the older films and I&#39;m really liking that. Can&#39;t wait to check this out whenever it arrives in theaters."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-12-03,WOW!  Just amazing and I think my favorite Saw movie.  Cannot do Saw without Tobin.  He is everything!  Also he cannot be dying as I want to see MORE!  ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-01,"This is one horror franchise that can stand the test of time. You come for the gore and stay for the story, just well executed movies."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"‚ÄúHello everyone, it‚Äôs time to play a <b>game</b> .Live or die, the choice is yours‚Äù<br><br>Those lines always sends chills down my spine. Seeing Tobin Bell return to his iconic role is amazing and legendary I‚Äôm very happy this franchise is going back to its roots after Spiral didn‚Äôt do so well. <br><br>This looks absolutely brutal, uncomfortable and fucked up and that‚Äôs how a classic Saw film should be."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-26,This storyline to bring Tobin back is nothing short of genius. What a time to be alive.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-11-15,"I‚Äôm actually siding with John Kramer; this is a shitty thing to do to an old man who only wants to live, and what‚Äôs worse is every person was roped into the scam"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,This looks like it‚Äôs going to be the most insane film in the saw series since the first three films and saw 6 and I am looking forward to it
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-09,Tobin Bell has got to be one of the most nicest celebrities anyone could meet. I met him in 2006 at a horror con and he was all over the place shaking hands and taking pics with fans. He mentioned he was in Goodfellas and I went home to rewatch that movie and found him as Robert De Niro‚Äôs parole officer. This man is age less
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,For the director to go all the way back to make a movie in between 1 -2 &amp; then figure out more twists to fit everything in together. This is a masterpiece
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-03-15,"&quot;Out of all the man to cheat, you pick John Kramer....?&quot; <br>Best line everüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-13,This actually looks like a movie that is needed in the series and will actually add to the story
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-13,I NEVER want this series to end
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,Glad to see Tobin again. Hopefully he gets as much screen time in this as he did in Saw 2
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-10-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3PzUo4P21c&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> Is Epic ...üí•"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-12,"The part after John says ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt retribution, it‚Äôs a reawakening‚Äù, shivers down my spine, the footage alongside that soundtrack is unreal, I really hope we get the Charlie Clouser remix of The Hollies ‚ÄúThe Air that I breathe‚Äù in the soundtrack"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-05,I never want this series to end. MAKE TOBIN BELL LIVE FOREVER!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-30,"Just got out from seeing this, and it&#39;s easily one of the best Saw films. I&#39;d be totally onboard if they just rewrote the Saw timeline and kept making films like this starting from here."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-12-01,Loved this Trailer. The movie felt like ‚ÄúSaw 2‚Äù. Meaning it was fantastic
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,Who would‚Äôve thought in the 2000‚Äôs we‚Äôd have nostalgia or reminisce of the times we got a Saw movie every Halloween? Looks great &amp; the color grading is perfect.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,Tobin Bell‚Äôs perfect as Jigsaw and I‚Äôm looking forward to this movie! üé•
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-01,John Kramer is always 10 steps ahead. The plot twist at the end had me smiling ear to ear ü§£
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-12-12,Who&#39;s here after hearing Saw 11 confirmed?
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-11,"I seriously love how personal this is, especially that they are focusing on Jigsaw entirely and run his game than being in the background. Tobin is an absolute legend!!! Cant wait!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-03,If this is them rekindling the flame for the saw franchise then I‚Äôm here for it or if this is them doing a proper farewell to Tobin then I‚Äôm here for that too. This looks great and seems to give off vibes of the originals.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-30,"What I loved about this movie was how emotional John was with dealing with these fake doctors, which wasn&#39;t something we ever got to see when he was dealing with other test subjects"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-08-30,Tobin Bell truly cemented himself as a horror icon
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-01,"No matter what other roles Tobin plays, I will always remember him as Jigsaw! He is perfect as that role. The voice, the terror behind his calm voice. That‚Äôs the scariest part."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"The classic cinematography, including the aspect ratio. The set design. The gnarlieness. This is a classic SAW movie, I&#39;m all for it."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-25,Massive respect to Tobin Bell still playing John Kramer at the ripe old age of 80
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2025-02-20,"One of the most intense movies I&#39;ve ever experienced and an experience that I haven&#39;t gotten from any other movie. Both emotionally and with what was happening, you feel the revenge/terror in a unique way that separates this movie into a class of its own. SAW has cemented itself in the horror genre for some time now, though X really is the film out of the series that goes &quot;This is what the fans deserve, not just deserve, but this is what SAW is and who John Kramer/Jigsaw is in the horror universe. This is why this series will live on and always will despite when it ends.&quot; It&#39;s like the definitive SAW movie and experience. Incredibly well shot movie as well, even during the simple scenes it&#39;s a beautifully directed movie. Not to mention the musical score which is top notch and really adds to the scenes, one of the first films in a long time that made me want to listen to the album of the movie. Master craft of cinema and you can just tell how much love went into it."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-02,This is definitely one of my favorite movies. As a kidney transplant patient I wanted Pederson to die from the beginning. An amazing villain to counter John as the protagonist. Tobin&#39;s facial expressions sold this entire movie.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,The annual experiences provided by Saw 1-7 back in the day have always been some of my most beloved memories as a horror movie fan. This trailer alone captured every reason why I was such a fan of this story better than the entire 8th and 9th films. Here&#39;s hoping it delivers.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"Its crazy to see a number 10 in a movie franchise, not to mention it is finally getting back to the best! Can&#39;t wait!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-09-18,"The beginning of this movie was so good and heartwarming. He did not portray SAW but an old, lonely ill man. The part where he helped the child was moving"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-04,"I just love how pretty this movie looks with the new HD cameras of the present, while still retaining the classic grimy look of the original films, Im so ready!!!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,John&#39;s ability to put together so many death traps before he died is astonishing.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-02,I‚Äôll never forget 2004. My brother took me to see the first movie and I was terrified but I loved it. I felt like it was the first time we genuinely bonded as brothers and ever since then it‚Äôs been my all time favorite horror movie series. I actually enjoyed jigsaw and I was a bit disappointed in spiral but props to trying something a bit different. I‚Äôm so happy this movie is coming out because if this is a final goodbye to John Kramer then hopefully it will be a perfect one.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-12-16,"I remember going to see this movie on October 29, 2004 when this movie was over and John Kramer had been laying there pretending he was dead the whole time and he stood up and slammed the door behind him the entire theater. There was not one person sitting down. I‚Äôll never forget that in my entire life fast-forward to 2021 October 29. My mother had broken her hip developed a blood clot. That went to her heart and killed her. Those are two things I will never ever forget one this movie and my mother one was a great Scary movie üçø <br>And the other was the woman who i loved more than anything <br>But this movie is right there with the Big ones now The exorcist Texas chainsaw massacre Jaws. This is a movie that you will remember Where you were when you watched it"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-07,"I will NEVER forget how I felt when I watched the end of the first movie. There have been hits and misses in between that movie and this one, but the original remains a classic. Let&#39;s see what this one brings!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-03,"This is my favorite series ever, not just in horror. The story is so enthralling and the traps are so intricate and interesting and I love the dillemma between John Kramer being bad for putting them in the traps and the victims themselves being terrible people. I will keep watching these for as long as they come out, no matter how silly, out there, or bad they get."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-07,"&quot;This is not retribution, this is a reawakening&quot; - John Kramer ...never gets tiring, the story continues!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-04-06,"wish I could be in the next film even as a disposable character, if only.. I would give it my all. Loved this series since the first film."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This has the classic saw feel and the traps look insanely viscious! Seeing john personally watch over a game is also very interesting and I&#39;m happy to see a movie that focuses primarily on him and not a disciple. Lastly, we saw glimpses of the bathroom game! I hope to cap it all off we also hear zepp10 at the end of the movie! This looks like a true saw movie going back to its roots all these years later and I&#39;m stoked to see it!<br><br>Also I know I&#39;m in the minority here, but while it is cool to see Amanda return I really wish it was Logan helping with this game instead. I know he was in the army at this time but Logan was John&#39;s very first disciple and is the current Jigsaw so I wish to see his backstory as well as him helping John in the past expanded more."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-22,"I absolutely LOVE the flashes<br>Where it shows the characters smiling, and then flashes to them now, in their traps, facing the consequences of their actions."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-24,"Who would‚Äôve thought the tenth entry in the franchise wouldn‚Äôt just be the best Saw film, but a damn good movie in general?"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"The cinematography looks amazing and it really feels like they are going back to their roots. The traps look gruesome and terrifying, the music is so good."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-01,"This movie exceeded expectations significantly. Almost didn‚Äôt feel like a saw movie for a while (in a good way). Use to the over the top focus on gorefest, but this one just had an amazing story, great traps, great characters and acting, just wow. Just as good (if not better) as the first one. Well done."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,I was actually surprised at how good this trailer was! Saw was always a favorite horror movie of mine. I remember watching the first one with my dad late at night and we couldn&#39;t help but stay up to watch it lol. Saw X looks like it&#39;s taking it&#39;s roots back to the older films. I didn&#39;t expect that after 9 sequels.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"This trailer just dropped half an hour ago and &quot;This is not retribution. It&#39;s reawakening&quot; is already one of the best lines from not just John Kramer, but the whole franchise."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,"‚ÄúOf all the men to cheat, you picked John Kramer?‚Äù<br><br>This is what I love about John. The thing is, if his victims knew what he was capable of, they would‚Äôve never messed with him in the first place. On the contrary, they still wouldn‚Äôt have had any problem doing this to other people beside him. That‚Äôs why what he‚Äôs doing is not personal revenge: it‚Äôs justice. If not him, then others less fortunate would‚Äôve payed the price, and John wasn‚Äôt gonna let that happen."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-02,"Blood spurting, guts unraveling, fiendishly lethal inventions, psychological torture and that first ‚ÄúI want to play a game‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äîit never gets old‚Ä¶"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-07-28,This might be one of the best movie trailers ever made the music the intensity and the emotion portrayed while not giving away too much is amazing.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,This looks like it has the potential to be one of the absolute best sequels in the franchise.  I am so ready for this!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-09-16,I&#39;ve seen the trailer thousands of times and I still get chills when I hear the doctor say &quot;John Kramer&quot;
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-31,Usually when a saga is too long it doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ Saw to me is an exception ‚ù§
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-08-24,The biggest milestone in the Saw Universe. This shouldve been the real sequel to Saw 1
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,The wait is finally over. I nearly shed a tear of joy.<br>The best film series and the best actor and its been too long since his legacy has been continued. Our childhood hero is back
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-01,"So glad Tobin is back he carried the later movies on his back, a true horror legend ‚ù§"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-03,"Saw this earlier today and it&#39;s definitely the best movie out of the entire series, Tobin Bell gives probably the best performance in his entire career here as well."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2025-03-22,Anyone else here mourning the franchise in 2025?
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,It&#39;s about time they brought back Bell. Saw 2 waa the best by far and Tobin shined bright. The scene between him and Donnie when he tells him to just sit and talk while he waits for his son is just so good and such a nice twist.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-04,"I am so beyond pumped it‚Äôs 2023 and we have SAW X releasing. <br><br>I was 14 when the original Saw released, and here I am, going to be 33 when Saw X comes out. <br><br>Bring it ON!!!"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,I must have watched this trailer 100 times. I dont get excited about movies anymore these days but seeing this brings me back to a time when movies excited me and brought me joy.
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2024-11-10,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3PzUo4P21c&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> saw 3 reference"
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-07-30,Love to hear that John Kramer will be the main character this time. This looks great!
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-01,"‚ÄúYou all pretended to cure me, but what I have planned for each of you is VERY real‚Äù My favorite quote from the trailer so far."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-01,"Just came out of the theater, and words cannot describe how much I love this movie. This was the first Saw movie I have ever watched in theaters, and hearing the Hello Zepp was so satisfying that I even got a bit of childhood nostalgia."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-12-03,As a SAW fan breaking fingers is the best trap you can ever get...
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-10-01,"I just saw SAW X in theaters and enjoyed every second of it.  Without trying to spoil anything, I believe this gave an engaging chapter in John Kramer&#39;s life and paid homage to the original series so well.  Although I&#39;ve watched Saw since the beginning and was familiar with twists, Saw X still manages to pull off surprising twists.  Please note SAW X has a mid-credits scene that I recommend staying to watch as well.<br><br>Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was nearly empty.  I only saw five other people in it.  Although an afternoon showing, weekends were usually peak times for theaters though many might&#39;ve watched Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie instead when it debuted alongside SAW X.  I hope any who are able will watch SAW X in theaters."
Saw X,t3PzUo4P21c,2023-08-11,"I&#39;m not necessarily a fan of the series, but I do respect Tobin Bell for what he did in bringing the franchise where it is sans Spiral. HE is the franchise. In a twist, we sympathize with him here. He was done dirty and technically he&#39;s not in the wrong here. Who knows? Maybe he would&#39;ve stopped his games if he was actually cured but it looks like this pushed him over the edge and turned him into the insane psycho many have come to love. This time, he&#39;s the &quot;good&quot; guy and while I usually steer clear of these movies, go get em John."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Tucker, Jason Bateman, Marlon Wayans and Viola Davis... this has got to be one of the most interesting ensemble cast in recent years!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-10,"MJ had 2 numbers in his career, 45 and 23. AIR was released 4/5/23. I saw the movie today and it&#39;s been a while since I felt this good leaving a theater. I&#39;ve been thinking about it all day and it&#39;s made me feel more uplifted. I also didn&#39;t expect such an amazing soundtrack, probably one of my favorites of all time. They even have Tangerine Dream who composed a lot of 80&#39;s soundtracks. The movie opens with a montage of 1984 including Ghostbusters and Beverly Hills Cop clips while &#39;Money For Nothing&#39; by Dire Straits plays. <br>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work great together like always, and Ben wanted Chris Tucker to play Howard White who Chris happened to know. So Ben basically let Chris write his own role because they believe in working in a friendly environment where everyone cooperates, and it certainly shows in this movie. This movie&#39;s acting, directing, and soundtrack was so good I&#39;m thinking of seeing it again this week."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,"As a kid growing up in Chicago in the 90s, this made me a little emotional.  There‚Äôs no one like MJ.  I‚Äôm soooo excited for this ‚ù§"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-28,"Wow, what an amazing line: &quot;A shoe is just a shoe.. until my son steps into it.&quot; That&#39;s powerful."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-15,"So glad to see Chris Tucker making a comeback, I hope he&#39;s still got his comical ways even though he&#39;s aged since Money Talks and Friday. It&#39;s about time he starred in another movie. Thanks for reading."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Seeing Ben and Matt together in movies together have a different feeling. Ben as a director is definitely a W.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"I had the pleasure of seeing MJ live ONCE, and when he was announced it was bigger than any rockstar I have ever seen, I have never heard it that loud in an arena since. It was just insane, then he dropped 50 without much effort"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"As a sneakerhead, and MJ fan, this is everything. I&#39;m there üòÅ"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-07,"This movie was absolutely amazing! Its really a story about persevering, risk taking, and instinct. Oh, and a little good luck. The speech Matt Damon gives when they finally meet with the Jordans is right up there with Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-21,"If you&#39;re reading this...May all the days of your life be filled with love, health, wealth and unlimited happiness. Many, many blessings‚ù§"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,The trailer was awesome. Ben Affleck never disappoints as a director ‚ù§Ô∏è
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-28,Great documentary/movie. Anyone who grew up in the 80‚Äôs will appreciate the soundtrack and all the 80‚Äôs references as well. It‚Äôs like a flash back.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-14,The shot of Jordan walking from behind is epic.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-15,"I&#39;ve watched AIR three times already, and I love it so much. Viola Davis as MJ&#39;s mom is a role model for all mothers, inspiring the strength we will need to try to live up to in order to face our country&#39;s problems. Even though MJ&#39;s mom is clearly a private person, it would have been nice to hear more of her story, for sure. I loved the male friendships in AIR because the team has intense disagreements but continues to support each other. There are so many beautiful monologues delivered perfectly, not only by Matt Damon but the supporting roles, too, as they try to take the right actions both for themselves and their team.    The humorous push and pull fight scenes between Falk and Vaccaro are laugh-out-loud hilarious! We watch the verbal sparring between basketball players, coaches, referees and other players, but we don&#39;t realize this happens with agents and recruiters for company sponsors. The storytelling in AIR is really suspenseful. The many obstacles Vaccaro must overcome are played out with good timing by expert actors. Even though you know the ending, you don&#39;t know when and how the news will arrive, so they figured out a way to use suspension of disbelief and tension, so a known story keeps you on the edge of your seat. It&#39;s such a beautiful, moving story with terrific actors and great writing."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"People really don&#39;t realize Jordan&#39;s global impact on sports. Every athlete who came after him is indebted to what he did. GOATs change the world. The word gets thrown around a lot, but they are actually very few of them."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"This cast is gonna go places, I can just feel it!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,That&#39;s going to be an absolutely amazing movie. What I&#39;m enjoying even more is how Ben is becoming a legendary director right in front of us.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-24,How did they have a trailer about Air Jordans and pursing MJ without ever showing Michael Jordan himself or even an actor playing him. Simply brillant. It&#39;s clearly about the journey it took to land him. I&#39;m all in.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-15,"MJ was bigger than life. In an era with no Internet, smartphones, social media, instant messages and videos, a basketball player was the most popular human on the planet."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,This cast is amazing and Ben is such an incredible director. Can‚Äôt wait to see this!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Affleck is such a darn good director.  I really can&#39;t wait for this.  I&#39;m honestly pretty excited to see Chris Tucker in his role for some reason, too."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,This looks great! Ben Affleck about to make another classic!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-13,"Saw the movie, grips you from scene one and never lets you go, brilliantly written, filled with great performances and  masterfully directed. Modern Day Classic!!!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-29,I actually watched this movie yesterday at a special premiere and I will say it‚Äôs awesomely mesmerizing.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-13,"I love Micheal Jordan, I was a kid when he changed Basketball forever, but Nike Signing Micheal Jordan is only the 2nd most important event in Nike&#39;s history. How Phil Knight started Nike is the story that needs to be told. He started working for a Japanese running shoe company (Onitsuka - ASICS) that almost NO ONE had heard of in the U.S. and made them a boutique brand in the American market, and tripled their North American sales basically by himself!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Ben is genuinely one of the best directors of his era , he can do period , contemporary, thriller , and put out a best picture contender every single time ..gone baby gone , the town , Argo, live by night (yeah I said it live by night lol) and now this ..and remember after Gilli everyone said he would never be able to work in film he was going to start doing tv instead ...I still get chills when I watch him go up to accept the best picture for Argo , a movie I seen with my dad that meant a lot to me so when he won for that and got emotional after everything he had been through I felt so proud and happy for him !"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"For someone that&#39;s never watched a single basketball game, I got chills all over my body. Awesome trailer. Hope the movie won&#39;t disappoint."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,I want another ‚ÄúThe town‚Äù from him. That movie was so freaking good
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-15,"What a GREAT movie, first real Movie since PRE COVID Finally a movie we can all love and what a soundtrack and cast!!  SO good"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-28,"&quot;Although not directly involved with the film, Michael Jordan met with Ben Affleck prior to the start of production and gave the project his blessing. The casting of Viola Davis was his idea.[12][13] Jordan also requested that Howard White, vice president of Nike‚Äôs Jordan Brand and his personal friend, be included in the film. This directly led to Affleck casting Chris Tucker, with whom he had long wanted to work.&quot;"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,Ben Affleck as a director is always on a whole other level
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Promising director, promising cast, promising trailer. Waiting for this üî•"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,"I saw this movie yesterday-It is a great movie, with great acting and a great soundtrack"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,Tremendous film.  Be sure to get out and see it in the theater.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-27,Ah the 80s and 90s my childhood....the best time to grow up
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,Ford vs Ferrari vibes. Matt and Ben together again. Chris tucker. Legendary Jordans. Nothing can go wrong. Already loving this movie
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-09,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!‚ù§<br><br>Nostalgic.. to the max !! <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely see it again
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-12,Time flies!  I still remember seeing Ben and Matt in Good Will Hunting.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,"I just got back from seeing this movie, and let me just say this was an awesome movie!!!! Congrats to Ben Affleck!!!! You&#39;ve got a winner here sir!!!!!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-18,Can&#39;t wait for the release date. Hope it becomes a success at the box office.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,This gives me chills...........I can&#39;t wait to see this
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"When I first heard about this movie, it sounded interesting with the premise, cast, and Affleck directing. Definitely going to theater for this"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Chris Tucker slowly making his rush hour return!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-06-12,"Just finished watching &quot;AIR&quot; on Amazon Prime.  I absolutely  loved it, and since i was 20 in 1980, the abundance of older pop culture images and sound-bytes brought to me much pleasure, as it was delivered so nice.  Awesome cast.  No one needs to be a die-hard sports fan to enjoy this storyline of great American history in business.   Beyond Matt, Ben,  and Jason; quite interesting to see Wayans in a somewhat serious role.  Was only disappointed once:   When the negotiation began on the % of sales,  it seems Mom vaguely stated  one number over the phone,  but later when Matt went to Ben, and Matt received Ben&#39;s approval, it seemed so unrealistic that numbers were never spoken.  And more unreal when Matt called the mom back, the absence of a numeric percentage.  Don&#39;t want to close on a negative note - thank you guys for this wonderful feel-good movie!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-25,I was a kid during the Jordan era. I owned those first Air Jordans when they were released. I remember buying them at Foot Locker. I think they retailed for $65 or something. I don&#39;t think people today can understand what a huge cultural phenomenon he was. NBA basketball went from tape delay to the biggest show on earth because of that guy. This movie just nails it.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,WE WILL BE THERE OPENING NIGHT!!!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,What an amazing trailer! You knew even before his name was mentioned that it was building up to MJ!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Jordan is the reason why I love basketball and I&#39;m huge Marlon Wayans fan.  Amazing cast and Ben Affleck directing makes me more excited to watch.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-18,Looking forward to seeing Ben and Matt working together.  Can this story be strong enough for a full movie!I  Hopefully we see some good 80&#39;s vibes.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-14,I&#39;ve never had a trailer give me goosebumps
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,"Bro! There&#39;s a movie about my favorite movie director, about my favorite singer, and now there&#39;s a movie about my favorite sneaker! I&#39;m all in for it."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-11,This really proves he&#39;s the GOAT. We knew what the movie was going to be abour. The first second &quot;Nike HQ 1984&quot; every hoop fan knew straight away. Before they showed Jumpman and they said his name.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,Go watch it!...Definitely recommend it!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-16,"You won&#39;t miss a single second of the pleasure the movie provided, I promise. I just watched it. Absolute genius with a fantastic cast, facial expressions, best dialogues really taken aback. If I had to give 11 out of 10 reviews, I would give the top movie of 2023."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Haha sooo ready for this!! Ben affleck and Matt damon back together again. With an all-star cast, love it"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Okay wow‚Ä¶I am sold. When he said the name ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù GOOSEBUMPS.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,"Before watching the trailer, I couldn&#39;t have cared any less. After seeing the trailer, I want to see this movie."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-30,A movie where the pre-trailer commercials just morph into a feature-length ad.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-09,I&#39;m excited - Matt Damon&#39;s project selection has been pretty good the last few years. And I love these trailer themes.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,It&#39;s nice to see Chris Tucker return to movies after a long hiatus
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Just got Goosebumps after hearing Matt Damon say the name &quot;Michael Jordan&quot;...
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,"Forget the cast, you can&#39;t go wrong with a movie trailer using Sister Christian by Night Ranger as the theme song haha I&#39;m in!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-17,It‚Äôs a simple yet effective story about hope vision and the people that believe in your greatness. A solid movie Bravo
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-09,Saw it Yesterday. Only all I can say is Bravo. Smells like Best Director nomination is coming for Ben Affleck
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Didn&#39;t know this was a thing.  Looks great.  I love the tone.  Great subject matter.  Perfect cast.  And of course Ben behind the camera.  Looking forward to this.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-13,Yep. This is definitely a hit. I&#39;m gonna watch the movie just because of that all star cast
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-11,Holy cow! Jordan turns 60 next week. AIR movie coming on April. This is gonna be epic!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-07,Just saw the movie 10/10 America needs  to be like this again.

Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,"Okay, It&#39;s official, I have just list my mind over this magnificent Trailer.<br>I have a feeling this will be the only movie people will line up for, including me. <br>They have all of the most amazing actors including Chris Tucker  who I adore!!<br>This is going to be amazing. <br>Love Jordan!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,Movie gonna be good no doubt since it got all the cast. Oscar worthy movie already.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2024-03-22,This trailer still makes me smile. What a great story.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-12,"Just watched it. Fantastic and inspirational story. Don&#39;t watch the trailer, just watch the movie."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,"Oh, this movie is so good. I really believe I&#39;m going to see it again. Mrs.Jordan, your son picked one heck of an actress to portray you. Viola Davis did such a beautiful job. &quot; ... I&#39;m sure it was a mistake that the percentage of the sales of the shoes be paid to Michael was left out of the contract. ...&quot;"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-28,"When you‚Äôre life is centered on watching the Bulls and Michael being drafted into NBA and watching that Bulls Dynasty flourish and thrive. Remembering LIVE when Jordan kissed the trophy after winning it.  Remembering all that time frame and I LIVED thru it (I‚Äôm 55). This movie is A MUST SEE for me. From college to his last game I‚Äôve been a Jordan fan. Just BLESSED I got to see HIM PLAY LIVE before he retired 2 times in United Center!  BLESSED as he became a player on MY team at the time The Chicago Bulls as I lived 45 minutes south of the city of Chicago.  Yes THIS is a personal movie for me AND CANT wait to see it. Love that I will be able, thru Ben and Matt, be brought back to my fondest memories in the past and live thru it one more time!!  I can‚Äôt say YESSS!! LET‚ÄôS GO!!! Any more than I have!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-13,i literally got goosebump all over my body.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-07,"CHILLS!! MJ is a legend. Ben is a remarkable director and Jason Bateman, Viola Davis and Matt Damon are the cherry on top. May be the greatest film of the year! Can&#39;t wait!"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-20,Just finished Watching this Film it was absolute beauty filled with Emotions. It is one of the best films that i have ever seen The Greatness of MJ has been shown into this Film. You Should Absolutely give it a try without any second thoughts‚ù§
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-07,Best movie of the year so far. Matt Damon did an amazing job üíØ
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-10,I&#39;d like to commend Nike and MJ for all they have done. Children around the world now have jobs because of these shoes! Truly inspirational!
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-21,This is it. The cast. The story. The performance of a life time.
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-18,"&quot;That&#39;s the literal definition of rookie,&quot; unless your name is Ben Simmons. üòÇ"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-29,"I&#39;m late to the party here, but I got goosebumps watching the trailer. Great movies are the closest things to time machines possible"
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-10-17,"I would call this the best film of the year, but it has competition: Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Covenant. Both are the best film of 2023."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-08,An amazing film.Great performances. Loved it.

Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-05-17,"17 May <b>23</b><br>Ben Affleck has become one of elite directors without a doubt. Michael changed the game, man. I wish I was around back then. I&#39;d have loved to watch him fly night after night. <br><i>Air</i> is one of the greatest cinemas ever made, period."
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-05,This movie was the longest ad I&#39;ve ever seen
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-02-09,A 120 minute commercial... can&#39;t wait!

Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-03-21,I watched the documentary.....I was so inspired by it as a designer....the creator of Nike Jordans thinks holistically....like I do...cannot wait to see this movie...
Air,Euy4Yu6B3nU,2023-04-19,"Just came back from the theater, great movie enjoyed it a lot!! Definetely the best NBA era and Michael meant and means a LOT more than just a great basketball player stands in the same podium as Ali, Pele and other top from all athletes in mankind. Good movie"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-12-01,"I got saved in September 1970 I was 15 years old, the best ever revival in the air !!!  They called us Jesus Freaks and Jesus People !   I‚Äôm still walking with Jesus !!!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-24,Jesus is still doing miracles. He saved me from suicide and gave me meaning and hope in my darkest of valleys. He is alive and can turn any life into something precious and above all He loves you.<br><br>God bless and thanks for reading.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"Just took 12 people to see this beautiful film, not a dry eye in the theater, my friends wept and gave there life to Christ right in the parking lot, others expressed there desire to go back to church again...Glory to God!!!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-28,In 1973 my wife&#39;s sister kept bugging her to come to a tent in a bean field in Costa Mesa to hear a preacher named Chuck teach the bible and hear some Christian rock/folk music. When the band played she recognized them: it was the Road Home and she had danced to their music at a nightclub in Newport Beach previously. She was shocked to see them in this tent. She was a cocktail waitress at the Red Onion restaurant in Palos Verdes at that time and we were dating. When she told me she got &quot;born again&quot; that night in the tent I was blindsided because she was somewhat of a hellraiser and the change was a dramatic 180 degrees. We got married and spent the next 39 years learning the gospel from Pastor Chuck until his very last time in the pulpit in 2013.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-26,I want more movies based on Christian stories or testimonies because there is nothing more encouraging than knowing how God has worked in other peoples lives and there are so many incredible testimonies out there!!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-30,"I got saved during the Jesus revolution, and I have been on fire for the Lord ever since.  This trailer brought me to tears.  I miss that simple and heartwarming fellowship with other believers so much!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,I&#39;m so excited about this movie! Praying that God will spark a new revival among this generation of young people!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-11-28,"I got to watch this movie yesterday, a surprise early preview. It is absolutely incredible! It definitely speaks to our generation today, and it‚Äôs very similar to how I believe we need to be reaching out to the new age group. They are eagerly searching for love, and for truth, just in all the wrong places. Come, Lord Jesus, come!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,"Just saw the film in a theatre this afternoon.  My review:<br><br>It is a rare thing when:<br>a) I watch a movie in a theatre; and<br>b) I can&#39;t think of anything negative about the film.<br><br>I give it a solid grade of &quot;A&quot;.  This movie is a must watch, especially during this time period of negativity and possible revival.  Let&#39;s flood the theatres with people and support it!  Praise the LORD for this production!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-18,My heart is singing! I was one of those Jesus Hippies/Jesus Freaks that was changed by the love &amp; power of Jesus through His Holy Spirit! I gave my life to Him over 50 years ago when I was just 18 yrs old and looking for the answers in life. Andre Crouch had a song that said it all! &quot;JESUS IS THE ANSWER&quot;! STILL A JESUS FREAK even in my old age! He saves and keeps us!!!! üòáüôåüôåüôåüôå
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-20,"I was there at the very beginning of the Hippie Jesus Movement in March/April 1969 in Santa Ana, CA! We attended Calvary Chapel with Pastor Chuck Smith. It was awesome! Jesus is my life. Everyone needs Jesus, especially those who don&#39;t think they do!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-27,"I saw this movie today. When it ended I went to the bathroom and just started sobbing. I came home, lay on my bed, and sobbed more. Now I&#39;m tearing up writing this. It&#39;s been a while since something affected me like this."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,I was born again in Chucks church. I‚Äôm so grateful for him opening those doors to all! My husband was saved when he listened to a Greg Laurie cassette tape. Looks like the film did it justice!! Can‚Äôt wait to see it.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,It&#39;s awesome that they cast Jonathan Roumie in this.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-15,"Who on earth can&#39;t love Jesus? Jesus is love, pure love."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-12-28,"I am an atheist, and I found that trailer very moving and life affirming. The idea of people coming together and overcoming differences is something that the world could use a LOT more of! :)"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-11-29,"Oh my!!!!! My dad worked for Chuck Smith and God used him as my mentor the first decade of my life and Greg Laurie is such a beloved part of the Body at our Calvary Chapel, I&#39;m so unbelievably psyched that this testimony is being released! Glory to God! I pray all the time for church to come back to beaches and His love to spread throughout the cities like wildfire! Let no believer be ashamed of the name of Jesus!!!!!!!! Let Hallelujahs ring!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"Man, I‚Äôm 23. <br>I party, I drink a little, I smoke. <br>I am not perfect by anyone and and I am not super religious at all. With that being said‚Ä¶ <br><br>This movie almost made me as a grown man cry. One tear rolled down my face involuntarily while I was right next to my girlfriend lol. <br><br>Dude. CHRIST is powerful. <br>His presence was so strong. <br>Great movieüíØü§ûüèΩ"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,"Wow, this looks absolutely amazing! Who else laughed out loud when they opened the door to find &quot;Jesus&quot; from The Chosen saying, &quot;This house has a very good viiiibe!&quot;? üòÇüòÇ Can&#39;t wait to see the movie!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,"It was a wonderful, beautiful time. It was a huge part of my life! Praise Jesus!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-25,The Jesus Revolution is a must see.  Very powerful.  No one left their seats during the whole movie.  Even during the credits.<br>The movie goers were groups of old people and right before the start of the movie came groups of young people.  It was amazing!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,This is a film about acceptance without judgement.    I lived this story.  Greg Laurie and Chuck Smith are incredible Christians.  Everyone should see this.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-18,"My brother was saved during this time,  he spent 15 years as a missionary.  Still reaching out to the lost"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-14,"This is the second time watching this trailer. The first time was maybe an hour ago. I tear up each time. This is soooooo amazing. Jesus, thank You for loving ALL of us. Some of us were previously considered &#39;unlovable&#39; by others. One day I will get to see You face to face. üòçüíïü•∞ü§òüèΩüî•üëë"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-04,"I ended up in a bean field too in July of 1978 (Jesus Northwest), a concert prepared for about 5000 for 3 days camping......40k showed (hence, spilling into the bean field).....never seen a group so convinced of Jesus Christ, so convinced (the last night) of sin while Keith Green preached (hard).....I was a 19 year old kid, my life changed radical, even to this day...have you ever seen 40,000 people cry?"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-19,Thank you for this! We need movies with Christ and a positive message more than ever hear days. Watching interviews where Kelsey Grammer tears up just talking about this movie brings me to tears myself. For someone to be so touched by the lord! Share with everyone!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,"My husband and I took our son and daughter-in-law to our local theatre. We purchased our tickets in advance. Jesus Revolution movie is so beautiful and inspiring! Kelsey Grammer is our absolute favorite actor of all time, and once again, he hit it out of the park! Thank you, Pastor Greg Laurie, for sharing and spreading the word of Jesus!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-11-11,Raised in Huntington Beach and a neighbor took my sisters and I (I was 9 or 10) to the Big Tent and we sat on the ground up front. I remember the music and the crowds. A couple years later a neighbor boy led me to Christ in his driveway after shooting hoops. What a time it was!  That shot of the actress playing Greg‚Äôs future wife smiling through the fence makes you feel young again. So sweet!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,Such an incredible movie! Brought my wife and I to tears throughout. Must of been such an awesome time to live through and experience. Let‚Äôs have another Jesus Revolution!!!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-20,"Jesus healed me of stomach ulcers in a matter of about 10 seconds and healed my back (in 2 places) in about the same amount of time on a different occasion. He restored my self worth, the list is endless. He&#39;s the same yesterday, today and forever. There&#39;s nobody like Jesus Christ. He&#39;s rightly named Lord and Savior!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-15,Jonathan Roumie deserves to be listed in title as well. Great actor and plays Jesus on The Chosen and does an amazing job. Give him his due.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-18,Can&#39;t wait to see this. I lived through this &#39;Jesus Movement&#39;...it changed my life forever!!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-27,"Incredible movie!!!! So, so good! Makes you laugh and cry! A must see! Touches your soul. If you are looking for the answer, go see this movie!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-23,"I remember the Jesus movement in the late 60s early 70s so well!  We were called Jesus Freaks.  My sister taught me a song that she learned at the time, and when I sang it, I was born again."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-02,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER! Made me cry from beginning to end. Very moving .
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-24,"Absolutely incredible!  Great acting, writing etc.  Having lived this in our little town of Ironton, OH back in the 70&#39;s the Jesus Movement truly was a nationwide event.  Still enjoying the music from that era to this day."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-27,I saw this in the theater and it was so good! Definitely worth watching! The comedy was so hysterical in there! God is doing amazing things in this country right now. Praise Him!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-12-20,Chuck Smith made a HUGE difference in my life as a new believer way back in 1979!! Love him and can hardly wait for this movie!!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,This movement has saved alot of us down the road. Glad to be part of calvary chapel churches. Got baptised at pirate cove in 2011 few years later pastor chuck passed on but he&#39;s so alive and perfect in heaven. Jesus told me this üôÇback then and  i stopped weeping immedietly. See you when we get there Chuck
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-25,I have wandered a long winding road and waited 40 years for this. A return to Jesus Christ. Best high I  ever knew.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-23,"Pastor Chuck had a huge impact on my life spiritually as a very young Christian believer in Jesus. As a young Army officer stationed on the DMZ in Korea in 1977, me and two other soldiers used to sit and listen to Chuck&#39;s bible teachings on cassette tapes.  He was and still is a mentor to me in and through his books, teachings and through &quot;The Word for Today Bible&quot;.  I thank God for the ministry of Pastor Chuck Smith.  What a blessing he was to so many.  Moreover I loved Maranatha Music and all of the early Christian music scene...Bethlehem, Mustard Seed Faith, Chuck Girard and so many more.  I look forward to seeing this movie; it looks great from the trailer."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-25,MASTERPIECE!!! I couldn‚Äôt stop crying watching this!!! God is amazing and I‚Äôm so happy to be apart of today and be apart of another Jesus Revolution !!!! üéâ‚ù§
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"It&#39;s a film about religion and faith.......<br><br>But when you strip all of that away, its really a film about loving yourself and loving others. A film about trying to figure out where you belong in the world and what is your place in this beautiful world! <br>That is something anybody and everybody can relate to! Amazing film!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,"My goodness this is a fantastic trailer!! What an outstanding cast! I can not wait for Feb, to see this movie and to watch how God uses it  to impact the masses!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-16,"Although the journey has at times been rough, I have been a devoted follower of Jesus for a bit over 27 years. Pastor Chuck (I miss you so much), Pastor Raul Reis &amp; Pastor Greg Laurie have been my radio/internet guides all through those years. I am nowhere near where I want to be in my walk with Jesus. Someday I hope to attend services in their beloved churches and hear them speak in person- Pastor Brodersen as well. I know the story and have heard it numerous times. Watching the trailer &amp; seeing it presented in movie format is going to be special. I can feel the tears already. This is going to awesome! Thank You Lord!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-14,"Cannot wait, love the cast, lived the time and knew the players.  Been a Jesus lovin hippie freak for over 50 years and never looked backed.  I am so grateful for the people who poured into me.  I hope to pay back at as many sean feught &quot;Let Us worships&quot; I can get to this year.  MAKE JESUS #1 AT THE THEATRE. MAKE HISTORY AGAIN AS WE NEED A REVIVAL."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,My husband and I watched this movie last night. It‚Äôs amazing!!! Praise God for this movie! May He use it to build His Kingdom!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,"Behold, the real Jesus Revolution is only just beginning in America, and then will spread throughout the world! I am so excited to watch this unfold. I love Jesus Christ and I have felt His redeeming love and power in my life, I want as many people as possible to feel it too! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-21,This looks amazing! Big shout out to Jonathan stepping up for such a daunting role cause i feel he fits it so well. The revolution of The Gospel feel like i can relate because of this church I go to called Doxa Deo Central and I relate to the new way to spread the Good News. Cant wait to watch with my friends
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-11,"I was blessed to see this movie in a preview screening last evening, very moving, emotional and unbelievable! I can&#39;t wait to see it again and again! A must see!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-19,"The timing of this movies release is incredible! The next Jesus revolution is starting now! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23asburycollege"">#Asburycollege</a>"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-16,This is a movie that will reach the unreachable and love the unlovable.  Many will brought out of the darkness into to the light of His Glory!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-03,This was truly suchhhh a phenomenal movie. I feel so inspired and have such a deeper desire to continue being loud about Jesus !!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-10,Jesus came into my life in 2018 and saved me from the occult and addictions . He is very real and all we need to do is ask him to come into our lives and heal us . He‚Äôs our best friend also
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-28,"I was born in &#39;69, and brought up in the church. Everything in this trailer is nostalgic and brings back beautiful warm memories of childhood. I must go see this!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-23,We NEED this flick. We need it maybe even more than we who lived it realize.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-15,"It&#39;s about time Hollywood produced something worthy, PLease  keep  em coming"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-27,"We saw it this afternoon. I was of the age that experienced some of that, back in the day. What an awesome movie that everyone needs to see, then DO! It was nice to see Kelsey Grammer playing such a great character. I hope Hollywood pays attention!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-28,"Such a great story; I can‚Äôt wait to see it on the big screen! Also, so excited that Jonathan Roumie is in this!! Looove his work in The Chosen."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-09-22,Saw the movie 12 times so far and this was my life also and came to Jesus many years ago out of the hippy drug lifestyle and have been free through Jesus ever since and still a hippy but now for Jesus üòä
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-24,"What an amazing time. I was 10 years old when I accepted Christ.  It was at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa. Does anyone remember the different bands playing there like Love Song. Also, when we moved from the little chapel to the Big Tent. The nights would get so cold but that didn&#39;t stop any one from coming to worship and praise God."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-14,This one is unique among the Christian movies!    High production quality and Top notch actors!!   Kelsey Grammar outstanding
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-23,Prayers out to you brother!!! There is a reason why we serve GOD!!!! He is what our soul longs for!!! Turn to him and have all!!! Do for him and your work won‚Äôt go unnoticed amen amen hallelujah praise GOD!!!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,This is SO beautiful to learn of the Jesus Revolution that took place in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s - we need more of this today! The world isn&#39;t gonna change but we can win more souls for God&#39;s kingdom at least with this kind of inspiration ‚ù§
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-25,"Saw this today, one of the BEST movies I have seen in years!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,I just saw this movie in the theatre. What a great true story portrayed with such passion!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-14,I got to see an early showing of this at a student conference called SALT in Dallas! Amazing movie! ‚Ä¶Tears were shed. Where my SALT folks at??
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-09,Went last week and I&#39;m going again next Monday night with some of my friends! Absolutely the best movie I&#39;ve watched since Maverick last summer! I&#39;m telling EVERYBODY about this film
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-27,Excellent movie. America and the entire world need more movies like this.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-17,"Something that‚Äôs not lost on me. Jesus said ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock.‚Äù And here they have Jesus from the Chosen knocking to let Jesus into his church."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"I was going to watch this excellent movie for the second time this afternoon.  Problem was that the next two scheduled performances were sold out and I didn&#39;t really believe it at first, I figured I needed to refresh the touch-screen with the seating choices but no, no available seating.  And I went home happy about that, actually, fantastic to see so many people discovering this chronicle of the Jesus Movement.  And I got saved in &#39;74 at the age of 14 after a summer of listening to KFAX in San Francisco and I have to give a nod of appreciation to a girl at school who was a smiling Jesus freak like all the time.  I moved away shortly after getting saved, my travel-crazy Dad got a job in Europe, but I&#39;m sure she was still letting her light shine for the Lord at Oceana High in Pacifica.  üòÄ"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"I saw this movie last night and it was incredible!  Having grown up in the hippie era, it was easy to relate because I used to be one of those that got involved in drugs and a rebellious lifestyle.  That is ... until Jesus stepped in and saved me!  This happened while I was stoned nonetheless and I had no idea how my life was going to change. I was destined for hell until the Holy Spirit filled me and changed who I was from the inside out.  Thank you Sweet Jesus for all you have done for me!!!!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-20,"I was born again thanks to another great man of this era, the one and only Chuck Missler. RIP."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-08,"Even after Death, Chuck‚Äôs testimony reaches people! I had no idea this movie was about him. He‚Äôs helped me in dark times listening to him on the radio!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-07-31,The amount of comments here are so moving and touching ... I was thinking about seeing this movie for a while. But never had to chance too . I was a follower of Christ but i walked away from him and ended up doing alot drinking and experimenting with drugs to try to fit in . But now im on my on my path trying to connect and walk with him .
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-16,I grew up in the 80‚Äôs going to Harvest and Greg being our pastor my whole life. I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-04-19,This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen by far.  If only today&#39;s youth would understand the true meaning of love and the feeling of spiritual awakening.  Such a remarkable and beautiful thing.  Technology is making people forget where we come from and who we are as spiritual beings.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-04-28,I wish and pray that this movement of unconditional love and welcoming sweeps across the world again and again. It‚Äôs hard to be shunned by my church and see the love a single man was able to head- I pray more followers be like him
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-26,I highly recommend this movie for people that want to dedicate their life to Christ! This is the first film that has literally ever made me cry a river lol. God bless!
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-11,"As a person who believes but is a sinner, know I sit here with tears in my eyes, uncontrollable tears, waiting to be in a better life. I&#39;ve been back and forth knowing the trials and tribulations riddled with my weskness. Please pray for my steadfastness to stay the path this time, pray for me to fully release my will and accept with my all,  pray for me to ask the right questions that will help me on the correct path, please"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-15,Our country is still a dark and divided place that still needs Jesus. A lot of great Christian music came out of this movement--new updated Christian music that drew people to Jesus Christ.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-25,"My husband took me to see this movie tonight, we both absolutely loved it!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-09,Saw it yesterday and it was Amazing and it made me feel Alive and I Teared Up about 15 times ! I‚Äôm Catholic and the Only time I felt Non Judged and felt love and Kindness was in a Christian Church just like this movie! My Brothers and Sisters their is Places like this you just have to Find them In your Area ! Thank JESUS for Movies and Actors like these
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-17,"My dad, may he rest in peace, always talked about this movement. He was a wild hippie and found God and knew Chuck and Lonnie, Chuck ordained my parents marriage. When my dad first went to the Calvary church, he brought candy and coke and was treating it like a show lol üòÇ"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-01-25,exMuslim from Pakistan. Now a born again Christian
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-01,"Saw this a couple of nights before and was powerfully moved. The message of Jesus‚Äô love was palpable throughout. I was brought to tears at the scene where Greg was baptized, and I felt his distress as he wondered aloud whether church/Jesus was just another drug. <br><br>While the film clearly has evangelical intentions, I agree with those who say that it‚Äôs still a relevant story for people who aren‚Äôt Christians and aren‚Äôt looking for the salvation all the main characters in this film are ultimately about. To me, Jesus Revolution is about the saving power of love, human connection, and genuine care."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-01,"Kelsey Grammer stars as Minister Chuck Smith who presides over the Calvery Chapel in Southern California. It is his best work ever as an actor.....Add a fabulous 60&#39;s &amp; 70&#39;s soundtrack and the film is a winner.....Kelsey helps form &amp; shape a young Greg Laurie into what he is today, Senior Pastor of Harvard Christian Fellowship in Riverside, CA....All the major actors are superb which make this an inspirational &amp; heartwarming film for all ages from children to adults to view....At the end the response was spontaneous as the audience stands up &amp; applauds....A standing ovation well deserved!....Philly rates &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot; 10 Stars!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-06-27,"That was a great movie.   I&#39;ve been to a Cavalry Chapel, and I didn&#39;t know their history.   God can never be defeated."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-16,"Asbury revival happening right now and spreading to colleges and universities across this country, two weeks before opening.  Could God‚Äôs timing be more perfect! ? Praying for another Great Awakening!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-28,"As stated by Greg Laurie himself in a recent interview, this film is an honest attempt to display normal, flawed people that were all transformed by Christ.  Yes, it&#39;s raw and quite emotional but again we live in a real world where people say they are always searching for truth.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the film serves as a great history lesson in U. S. history for a movement that is rarely discussed in secular American history textbooks.  Sure, we have heard of the Great Awakenings that involved Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield and Billy Graham, but many of us rarely hear about the Jesus Revolution of the 1970s that started in California and spread to the rest of the U. S."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-06,"Just saw this movie yesterday and all I can say is WOW!! I got saved in the early 80s and was surrounded by people who had been in the Jesus Movement. They understood and appreciated just what they had been saved from. Unfortunately, since then, my circumstances have forced me into dry, dead churches that I&#39;ve allowed to affect me. <br>Yesterday brought me back, and my mind and heart have been trying to process it ever since. Hope it comes out on dvd soon because I plan to watch it again and again. <br>My heart breaks wide open suddenly to pray for and minister to the next two generations (millennials and Gen Zers), who have been ruined by both evil and had nothing but dry, dead churches. I hope you will do same if God puts it on your heart."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-03-08,"I had no idea about this movie until today (3/7/23). I was a teenager in the early 90&#39;s, and I remember going to the Harvest Crusade in Anaheim back in 92, 93 and maybe 94. I moved to Oregon in 94 at the age of 15, and here I am at 43 and I still remember those events quite vividly. I will checking out this movie for sure!"
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-08-21,This is an AMAZING movie!! A must see! Chuck Smith was one of the first pastors I ever heard on the radio when I was a new believer. God used him greatly!

Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-10-28,Love love love this! Kelsey knocking it out of the park once again! CANNOT WAIT! :)
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-26,Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa had Christian concerts during the 80&#39;s. That&#39;s when I saw Chuck Smith preach. Great preacher.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-11-09,"Looking forward to this.  Some of the girls in my dorm in San Diego would take a bus that took them to Chuck&#39;s church in Costa Mesa once a week...this was in 1970! I never wanted to go with them, but I ended up being saved through this ministry!  It was a real time of openness to the gospel. Young people were really seeking."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-02-20,"This movement had a giant impact on my life.  After growing up in a church that didn&#39;t really preach the Bible, someone opened the scriptures for me, and I met Jesus in 1971.  For almost 30 years I wandered from church to church, never finding one that exactly followed the Bible as I had come to understand it after receiving Christ.  Then in 2000, I was invited to Calvary Chapel by one of their pastors.  What Calvary was teaching was exactly what I believed and was searching for.  Today, I am one of three elders in a small Calvary Chapel fellowship in rural Utah.  I can&#39;t wait to see this picture.  However, because of the dominance of the regional religion, it won&#39;t be shown locally.  I&#39;ll either be making a long drive or waiting for the video release.  But still, I can&#39;t wait."
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2023-04-02,I saw this movie yesterday and I love it. I never knew about Greg Laurie til now.  I&#39;m only 48 years old and didn&#39;t live in California.  I don&#39;t cry during movies that often and I shed like 3 or 4 tears during the movie.  I&#39;m glad Pastor Chuck accepted them and didn&#39;t think Lonnie was full of stuff.  Lol. And I&#39;m glad he chose to work on his marriage.  And I&#39;m glad Cathy got back together with Greg.
Jesus Revolution,8vmHFvnjPDw,2022-12-25,Share this with everyone you know! This movie could really move a lot of people to Christ! This coning from a guy who didn&#39;t want to be a christian until I learned who his was.

No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-05-13,I had the privilege of sitting front row center for &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot; on Broadway while Andrew was playing Evan... I was destroyed by his performance...he&#39;s a REMARKABLE talent and I&#39;m so happy he&#39;s getting to do more! This looks hilarious and I can&#39;t wait to see it!

I definitely have to buy this on 4k.<br>Jennifer Lawrence is a total babe. ‚ù§‚ù§By the way, the first few musical phrases in the end credits song sounds like the musical phrase in an interstellar song. That&#39;s quite interesting. I love this movie. Everything about it is amazing: the acting, the humor, dialogue, cinematography, the music. It&#39;s also reminesent of the American Pie movies and Superbad. It&#39;s my kind of humor mixed with a heartwarming ending. 10/10 film!"
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-03-09,Finally a movie with Jennifer Lawrence on the big screen where she belongs and finally she has a comedy movie...I&#39;m gonna watch this for sure.

No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-06-25,20 ish kinda movie. No big CGI. No costume. No explosions. Just pure acting!
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-05-22,The boy seems to be dedicated and focused on what he wants to do with his life. He is smart and ambitious so what reason is there to fix him when he is perfect and ideal in every way. This is the person that society expects us to be. Serious and commuted to doing what is important. To be honest my parents would wish for me to be that types of person
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-05-25,I cannot wait to watch this movie. It‚Äôs been a LONG time since I‚Äôve actually gotten excited for a comedy
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-03-13,It almost feels like an 80s comedy. Definitely will check it out
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-06-29,"Hilarious! Terrific movie. It didn&#39;t stop bringing the laughter and was very well done. Well-paced and refreshing character variation using a simple idea. If there is a superior way to reproduce a classic theme, this is how you do it. I&#39;m not even sure how they evoked the comedy all through the movie, it was quite skillful. Every setting took a left turn. The roles were strongly individual and produced unexpected results, but zany-believable. It&#39;s as if they took handfuls of normal events, mixed them together in a lottery, and the resulting nontraditional setups drew us in to embrace the unique personalities and their interactions even more. There was plenty of resistance and opposition, but it was anything but cold."
No Hard Feelings,P15S6ND8kbQ,2023-03-10,Jennifer Lawrence has such great comedic timing and a funny personality. I can&#39;t believe this is only her first comedy. ü§£ü§£

I don&#39;t know why, but somehow it was terribly sad to me. Being caught in a lonely place makes me feel that way. Mia was sort of indecisive sometimes, genuinely like all of us, but she needs to be  saved from the hell of loneliness. She deserves it."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-13,It really is a great time for the horror genre.  It‚Äôs nice to see smart drama/horror films getting the respect and interest they deserve.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-16,"A24 has some of the best original horror stories. They seem like they have requirements for directors to be original,because everything they put out feels fresh."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-12,"Whoever is running A24, I can&#39;t thank you enough for all the great movies you distribute. Basically a blueprint in how to run a distribution company and a lesson to all others that you have to have an identity and a soul so people can relate to, like, and trust you to give them quality every time."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"I‚Äôve been following the directors‚Äô journey since elementary school, as someone who did YT for a while and transitioned into filmmaking, it‚Äôs amazing to see this. Phenomenal work y‚Äôall üôåüèæ"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-02-04,Just watched. This is the best horror movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. Really clever premise and loved the ending. All of the actors were great especially Sophie Wilde. That girl can act.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,SOMEONE SAVE THAT DOG
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-02,this movie had my jaw on the floor. sophie wilde knocked it out of the park and so did zoe terakes and chris alosio. some particular scenes with riley were were insane. the ending left me feeling empty yet wanting more. really hoping for a sequel because this cast had some impeccable chemistry. really wish this movie could have made it to the two hour mark because it was amazing. an amazing directorial debut for the racka racka brothers hope they do more horror movies
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-09,Just finished the movie. Haven‚Äôt had a movie literally give me chills and anxiety in a long time. Ending definitely made me feel empty but still so freaking good.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Was waiting for more A24 horror.  They literally never miss.  Can&#39;t wait.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-09-24,"Just finished watching it. 10/10. Very good. Great acting, character development, the right amount of gore, right amount of jumpscares, and even something that could be believable if you genuinely believe in supernatural and afterlife. Very well done!!!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,This trailer looks intense and really shows what horror and addiction is. I hope the movie turns out awesome. So happy for the brothers!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2025-04-14,"I loved this movie. Riley&#39;s experience, especially in the hospital was touching. He went through a lot."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,I remember hearing that RackaRacka wanted to get into filmmaking and I never EVER imagined them getting to this level so quickly. I‚Äôm glad their talent was able to shine through and they‚Äôre getting the recognition they deserve. This is gonna be one to remember
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"I was at the screening for this at Overlook Film Festival.  It was the Secret Centerpiece Screening there, and it&#39;s one hell of a ride!  Trust me, you guys are NOT ready for this one!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-13,A24! BRING IT AGAIN!!! This studio... one hell of a track record. It&#39;s truly incredible how many great films they&#39;ve put out. It&#39;s like a list of Criterion worthy movies down the line.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-01-14,"This movie just made history. I envy those who saw it in the cinemas. If I could go back in time and watch a movie in the cinema, this is one of those."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-15,Came back here to say that this movie is worth watching. We watched this in the cinema. It made me gasp so many times. It doesn&#39;t just rely on the jumpscares. The whole movie gave a foreboding atmosphere that made you scared and tense the whole time.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,So fucking happy for Danny and Michael. All these years of work and dedication are paying off. It is fabulous to see
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"So proud of Danny and Michael, saw this movie last year and it was a blast! It&#39;s a must see in cinemas!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-11-24,"I&#39;ve never heard about this movie til now, and while it looks SO incredibly interesting, I can&#39;t explain how instantly glad I was to see them remove the dog from the room ü•∫"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-14,This was so well done. It depicted drug induced psychosis and peer pressure perfectly. The scariest part was how much I could relate to it.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"Australia represent!! so proud of how far Danny and Michael have come, cant wait to see this one!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-28,"Absolutely amazing how far Danny and Michael Philippou have come from shooting videos from their backyard to directing movies, they deserve the recognition!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-12-05,Saw this at the Sundance Film festival. It had the whole theater screaming. In my stop 3 of all time. <br><br>This movie is absolutely insane.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-09-20,I think the movie is a metaphor for how lost the youth are like wandering spirits yearning to be possessed by a soul that gives them a high while the souls are wandering spirits looking for a vessel to feel what it&#39;s like being alive again.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-08,Was skeptical after seeing the trailer. Went and saw it anyway. Probably one of the best suspenseful movies I‚Äôve seen all in the last few years. Fantastic.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Been following the racka boys for ages. Proud of them making a big movie and it getting picked up by A24 at Sundance is so huge. This looks insane so keen
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-12-01,Now i need to watch more of Aussie movies. This was brilliant
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,It&#39;s amazing to think that 2 crazy brothers have now made a film I&#39;m very exited to see. The imagery already looks great! Can&#39;t wait for July!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-28,"The ending completely blew me away, I saw it last night and still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs insane and such a fun time. 10/10 so proud of rackaracka for making this banger"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"This is surreal, the fact you guys went from Ronald McDonald beefs to a whole life A24 movie is insane, so proud of rackaracka"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-11-13,Danny and Michael Philippou are gems!!!! keep it coming boys!!!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-17,Can not remember the last time I have seen a horror movie this good. They absolutely blew this one up!!! Brilliant story telling that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and not just loud jump scares that hurt your ears. 10/10.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-12,A24 is ran by some absolute legends. The movies they select  are very intriguing. Will be hitting the theatre for this.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-30,Just finished watching this movie and it was honestly so scary and really good. Felt longer than an hour and 30 min. It was super graphic and had me shook the whole time. I was interested the whole movie waiting to see what was going to happen next üò≥
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-01-27,stop watching the trailer and watch it! 10/10!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-23,A24 sure is one of a kind. Talk To Me isn‚Äôt your generic horror film. It actually has real substance in terms of its plot and characters. We can see here how the psychological aspect to it takes center stage.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Awesome to see filmmakers start on YouTube and then literally go to the biggest indie film company. Major respect raka twins.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-12,I‚Äôm V glad they put the dog out. No need for doggo to be part of their spooky shenanigans
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-27,"Here from Rogan. I&#39;m happy he had them on,my wife and I are gonna love this movie tonight."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,A24 is on another level. No studio is touching them yet
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,It&#39;s nice to be part of a moment of cinematic history like this
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"I can not even begin to describe my excitement for this movie, I know and have worked with a few of the actors and crew and have been hearing about it all for months!! I‚Äôm so ready to see this in theatres ‚ù§‚ù§"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-29,"I have to say, i havent seen a horror movie this good in a loong time. They usually focus on being gore or jumpscares too much and the story falls flat all the time. Not with this one though. I loved how they tied each event together and that the characters react to the given situation in a pretty realistic way. I thought the ending was smart too. Applause for the writers! :)"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-09-23,Some of the acting was insane! The cast did very well together üëè
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-02,"I thought Talk to me was a brilliant film from beginning to end. The people who hate on this film probably just don‚Äôt truly understand the meaning of it. For a directorial debut from a group of YouTubers,they did an amazing job. The concept is truly unique and while the film isn‚Äôt as scary as people were claiming,it definitely knew how to keep the shock factor and intensity going. The film had a good handful of graphic and disturbing sequences that just leave you with nothing to say because it‚Äôs so much to take in. I loved this film and I wanted to keep my expectations low that way I didn‚Äôt walk out disappointed. It may have been predictable at moments,but at this point in our generation,we can pretty much guess what will happen in any given film. At the end of the day A24 is such a great production company,because they make such interesting concepts that are either Great or not for you. And if a film from their company is for you,it sticks with you for a long time. Truly think it‚Äôs one of the better films of this year and there‚Äôs a lot to love about it."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-08,"I recommend this movie 100%. I enjoyed it quite a bit, it was just straight up a fun watch. Great pacing and great performances, very .. stylish I guess is a word I would use. It&#39;s a step above things like Insidious and The Conjuring in terms of its maturity, as those films I consider to be &quot;horror for kids&quot; this felt more broad in its intended audience but its not particularly scary or disturbing, conceptually or in terms of its gore. Just a solid, fun film. Very strong directorial debut."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2025-03-26,Can‚Äôt wait to watch this Friday on Netflix been wanting to watch this for a while.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-18,"One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Had goryness, horror, suspense, non stop plot twist and actions. 10/10 for me"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-06-06,"Was lucky enough to see this flick in New Orleans last March as part of the Overlook Film Festival - it was the Secret Centerpiece screening. Believe the hype for this one, and don&#39;t miss the chance to see it in theaters this summer. Not just a great horror movie, but a great movie that happens to be horror."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"With all the releases from A24, they solidifying that they are the best production studio out there right now."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-01-25,I still come back to this trailer from time to time
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-08,"I want to see this movie soo bad, especially after looking at the vlogs from the directors, they all seemed very happy to have their movie be recognized, they seemed to have to put so much effort and their family‚Äôs reactions were very emotional. I really want to go support them so they can keep making movies!!!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,forever in love with A24 for pumping out stuff like this
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-15,Now that was a trailer! No jump scares and not too much revealed. Just creepy suspense
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-10-08,"bro i used to see racka racka guys since i was like 12... this looks insane, hi from Guatemala guys... send all of you a lot of love"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"This is the best horror movie I&#39;ve seen in ages, you&#39;re all in for a ride"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-13,"A24 has never disappointed me, the depth they put into their characters and their storyline is incredible and the execution is always nothing short of perfect"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Good to finally see some Aussies given a bit of international recognition! Danny and Michael leading the way!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-13,A sequel with her being in comma in real life while she&#39;s in the spirit realm would be great. Fighting the evil spirits and demon who impersonate her mother to get back to her physical body.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Glad I watched the premier at her majesty&#39;s theatre. One of the best movies ever! Also loved that you put a soundtrack by Sadistik! One of the most underrated rappers.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"Been watching RackaRacka for years so this feels like an accomplishment for me in itself. Hurry up Lee we want to watch! LFG Danny and Michael, you guys are killing it."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-22,Just watched it last night. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! movie was great from start to finish. The suspense! the thrill! it has it all. best movie in 2023!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-06-15,The first scene reminds me of when people smoke salvia and everybody is sitting around watching with laughter.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-27,Man &quot;Talk to me&quot; was my favourite dirty talk phrase... Now I gotta worry about ghosts and sh!t.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,Amazing work boys!!! These 2 deserve all the praise and hype they get. Let&#39;s get around them!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-16,I freaking LOVE Sophie Wilde! That‚Äôs a lit role üî•üî•üî• A24. Must See. Anxious!!!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-11-09,"Had to come here to see if everyone had the same opinion as me on this film. And I was not disappointed! Really worth every minute of viewership! From start to ending.. the best ending I‚Äôve seen in any film let alone horror. Rounded off the story perfectly - even leaving room for a sequel. Saying that, if there wasn‚Äôt one I‚Äôd still be satisfied with what this film offered. Really do recommend for horror lovers!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-18,"Just saw an advanced screening of this in NZ, I&#39;m not much of a horror fan but it was really great, plus original. And it&#39;s the first film for these directors. I&#39;m sure the films lead, Sophie Wild, will soon be very famous."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-12,"We need a part two!! I love horrors, but it&#39;s hard to get them right and was honestly brilliant and exceeded my expectations!!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-13,Im very proud rackaracka a year later finding out about your upload i bursted into tears watching you guys make the horror movie not only have you two been making videos together as young kids aspiring to be filmmakers one day going to the sundance film festival vowed by a lovely family figure but now are attempting to direct an unique horror film in the shape of something symbolic fitting the interscope of A24 logo using it as a plot device in a horror movie i cannot wait to see this &amp; will be going in with high expectations after following your passionate careers for a very long time &amp; the reception major director&#39;s have given you guys.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-09-29,"Well acted , well directed, brilliant storyline. Thank you A24. Now, where&#39;s that night light?"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-03,"A24 not only distributes fantastic movies but they also have already agreed to every single SAG requirement, despite being a small indie studio. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,A24 should be recognized  all over the world
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-17,"Just saw this movie and damn, as a horror fan myself I loved this movie so much. The ending made me feel so empty and scared because what if that‚Äôs really a thing you know‚Ä¶ major respect for the brothers and congratulations on their first professional movie that‚Äôs being shown all over the world atm, they deserve it!"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-01-19,I watched it with absolutely no expectation because you know horror movies nowadays‚Ä¶ but it surprised me coz it is actually quite a decent horror movie. I will give it a 7.5/10
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"Let&#39;s go boys. Come a long way from WWE wrestling in your backyard, to your first ever feature film getting picked up by A24. Congrats Michael and Danny, so excited for this film, and your ever bright future."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-08-13,This movie needs a 2nd part undoubtedly.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-30,"Would definitely recommend giving this one a try in the cinema! Unsettling experience, cool concept and felt quite refreshing without relying on constant jumpscares."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-04-18,Man someone please suggest me more movies like this!!!<br>ABSOLUTELY LOVED A HORROR AND THRILLER FILM AFTER A LONG LONGGG TIMEEE

Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-09-06,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLAKJu9aJys&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> I was like woah a trailer has never made me feel this before. And THENNN I watched the movie. Oh boy nothing could‚Äôve prepared me for this ride. My favorite film now though, by a long shot."
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-18,I saw this movie at the Berlinale and it was one of the best movies in the horror genre! Really dark and twisting!
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-04-22,When you smoke and it‚Äôs not weed.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,A24 is the studio we so badly needed
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-19,Goosebumps when Danny and Michael‚Äôs names came up üò≠

Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-24,Very. VERY GOOD. I recommend. A24 doing a brilliant job as always.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-07-29,"This is an excellent horror movie, it‚Äôs really good. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be emotional but wow it made me cry. The ending was really cool but sad"

Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-09-22,Part 2 Please
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-10-26,If you‚Äôre debating on watching it just do it!! I debated too üòÇ I usually head to the comments when watching trailers and if I see 3-4 positive comments in a row I‚Äôm sold
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"when it comes to constructing a compelling horror film, you really gotta<br><br><br>hand it to them"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-20,YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! One of the best horror films ive ever had the pleasure of seeing. Its brutal and tense and amazingly acted.
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2024-01-28,Just finished watching and I was blew away üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ sheesh ! Definitely gives Insidious vibes but in a different way. I need a part two üò©üò©
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"I don&#39;t care if everyone dies, as long as the dog is ok"
Talk to Me,aLAKJu9aJys,2023-04-11,"Idk the directors, but I&#39;ve always loved A24&#39;s films, especially their horror films, so I am PUMPED for this!! July, come closer pls!!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,It‚Äôs always refreshing to see Godzilla return to his villain role every once in a while. And the fact that this movie is set right after Japan loses WW2.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,I like how Toho is modernising the franchise without losing their style or identity.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us,&quot; followed by the roar was absolutely bone-chilling."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-09,This was genuinely a masterpiece. I never expected a Godzilla film to be this amazing but my god. One of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie theater.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"Looks incredible ! I love the way they show Godzilla isn&#39;t just walking around, he destroyes EVERYTHING."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,It&#39;s nice to see Godzilla treated as a horror monster instead of just an action hero
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster...will never forgive us&quot;<br>That line sent chills. I like that.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-03-11,Historic moment.<br>Godzilla minus one won the Oscar.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"you know you are doing great with a character, when even 69 Years later it still gives goosebumps generation after generation"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"The idea of Godzilla holding a grudge against an entire country, then waiting for them to be at their weakest before striking at them again is... It&#39;s actually really chilling."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,My favorite part of this whole trailer is how they managed to implement the impact that godzilla inflicts to the city by just walking! Like the ground breaks with every step
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-04,‚ÄúThat monster will never forgive us‚Äù is by and large the most chilling and amazing line ever uttered in a Godzilla film.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"Can we just applaud Takashi Yamazaki? This man directed, wrote, and did the VFX of this movie. Even if this movie someway, somehow manages to fail, you gotta give this man props."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,‚ÄúThat monster‚Ä¶will never forgive us.‚Äù I love that line. This movie is gonna be great
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,Love this moment when Godzilla took a step and the ground was pushed up. Stunning.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-03-11,The time has come.<br>The Godzilla franchise won his first Oscar ever.<br>Congratulation.<br>What a great time to be a Godzilla fan.<br><br><br>Long love the king.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster‚Ä¶ will never forgive us.&quot; As it cuts to Godzilla‚Äôs roar sends chills up my spine. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters. This looks amazing!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"It really feels like a modern proper remake of 54. The roar, the atmosphere, the destruction. What a time to be a Godzilla fan"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-01-30,Just saw this film and was blown away with how incredible it was.  It puts modern American films with big budgets to shame. This film combined a compelling humanistic story with the thrill of kaiju.  Fantastic film.  Definitely go watch this!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-07,"Godzilla has always been a fascinating paradox. He is a character with the dichotomy of being either a destructive monster and a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power, or a comic book superhero and defender of Earth, as well as a symbol of Japanese national pride."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-10,"people tend to forget the the original Gojira was intended as a horror movie, aimed at the horrors of nuclear weapons and war, i love how this brings him back to that root and makes him terrifying<br><br>also that roar is just..."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; confrims that this is exactly the kind of Godzilla story I love.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-01-01,"This one nearly flew under the radar. I spotted it randomly whilst looking at film listings. 10/10, I literally have no words on how great this film is and what a joy it was to watch such great storytelling and action. I echo the thoughts of other comments about how emotional this film was. The themes it touched on. This pisses all over anything Hollywood produced and will ever produced."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"Although I‚Äôm used to Godzilla being the protagonist, this classic antagonistic Godzilla has me screaming out of joy, never been so satisfied with the glory and beauty of such an iconic figure"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,As a 32 year old who&#39;s loved Godzilla my whole life... this is everything!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I think the most amazing aspect is that we see people&#39;s deaths. We don&#39;t watch Godzilla walk through city streets from an eagle-eye view, we&#39;re on the ground as Godzilla tears through buildings and people are flung into the air or crushed. The human suffering is always hidden away, which will make this movie truly horrifying and real."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-03-12,"This movie has won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a well deserved Award."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,For someone that has been a Godzilla fan since childhood this is what I have always wanted: a modern remake of the original with all its themes and commentary intact.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-08,That classic roar sent chills down my spine‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the first time a Godzilla roar actually sounded ominously frightening!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"You can tell that this will be gory and brutal, since you hardly see people get directly killed by Godzilla, save for a handful of movies."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-11-03,"I love that you can feel the overwhelming power of Godzilla, even the apocalyptic theme returning to Godzilla&#39;s original message."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"The design for Godzilla is amazing considering it seems to be paying homage to what inspired his original design to begin with. Scarred, radiation-burnt flesh to signify the way he was created."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I&#39;m all for Godzilla being the hero, but I sure do love his roots and what he&#39;s meant to be portrayed as, a monster beyond the comprehension of men, a metaphor for destruction and outcome of war, except Godzilla is the personification of that. Just seeing this trailer gave me chills. I&#39;m so pumped for this movie."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"From the looks of this trailer I think it‚Äôs really cool how much emphasis they‚Äôre putting on the devastation Godzilla causes to humanity. Not like it hasn‚Äôt been done in previous entries but to see the emotion the impact, the actual destruction of Japan in a perspective like this hasn‚Äôt  been done in a while"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-03,"Just saw this movie this weekend. One of the best films of all time and in my top 5, out of the 1000s of movies I&#39;ve seen in my life.  Simply perfect!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"This movie looks incredible. Godzilla is CGI but still looks real and horrifying. I like how the destruction is shown, from the perspective of humans, being crushed, falling off buildings and getting stepped on, and I‚Äôm excited to see how they‚Äôll do the scenes with battleships! I‚Äôm unbelievably hyped for this film!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"&quot;That monster will never forgive us&quot; This line got me hyped especially if it means what I think it means. Godzilla being both a force of destruction and an actual character with goals and personality, the last where we see him completly scared made me hopeful we will dive into his tragic backstory too."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-06,"No matter what the form of Godzilla, no matter what the series.......Godzilla always gives me the chills."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-01-07,"Man, not going to lie. This is a really good version of Godzilla. There were even a few tears in the audience. Very pleased and very well done!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,&quot;From Zero to Minus&quot; is very impactful. To face this terror post-war for Japan would be devastating
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I‚Äôm 68 years old, I have loved Godzilla since the first one came out way back in the day! I‚Äôve already told my daughter that I want to see this movie as my Christmas present!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-06,Godzilla has to be the only cinema character were they can keep making movies about him and we never get bored of him. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-28,"It&#39;s about humanity, love, and war. There were tears in my eyes. Will go down as one of the classics of all time--and this generation&#39;s matter-of-fact Godzilla movie that just slays."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-10-14,&quot;That monster... will never forgive us&quot; Is such a great line
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,the way Godzilla is breaking the ground by stepping shows he&#39;s not messing around and i love it
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot;<br><br>Absolute chills.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-03-11,"And now Oscar winner! Congratulations Godzilla MINUS ONE. In my humble opinion, it should have been nominated for Best Picture."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"Props to Toho for bringing this to American theaters one month after Japan&#39;s premiere.<br>I recall wondering when I&#39;d get the chance to see Final Wars in theaters, back in 04/05."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-11,"The roar gives me chills. I love how it‚Äôs more of a horror film, it makes Godzilla look more of a threat. Looks incredible."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,Even after nearly 70 years! They still bring the king of the monsters back to the screens! Let‚Äôs go Godzilla minus one!

Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,This looks epic. What a time to be alive. Classic Toho style Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla stories at the same time. We are truly blessed by Godzilla.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-11,"I love the dichotomy between toho Godzilla and Legendary Godzilla in how they are both pictured as forces of nature... makes me all the more excited for this movie. <br>Legendary Godzilla is a hurricane, he doesnt care about humanity unless humanity is directly involving themselves in his business. Hes just there to do his job and defend his home<br>Toho Godzilla is like a man-made disaster, what happens when you poke at earth too much and earth pokes back. Hes directly targeting humans in retaliation. <br><br>Its two very different tones for the exact same character and we get to see both at the same time via different studios (given Monarch: Legacy of monsters will be releasing a month before this)"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,The design feels like a mix between Heisei and Legendary. I absolutely love it.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-01-15,The Japanese know how to make a good movie! Looks like the Godzilla I always wanted too see.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"There&#39;s so much inspiration going on in this trailer. Im getting 1954 vibes, Shin vibes, and even Legendary vibes. This movie really looks like its going to be the great film."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-09,‚ÄúFrom Zero to Minus‚Äù<br><br>There‚Äôs something horrifying about this concept. This is gonna be something special
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,peak has arrived
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-04,"One of the best movies of the year, this should be a Oscar consideration I&#39;m so fucking serious..."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-06,"Yes, this is Godzilla done right. You really get the feel for the magnitude of the raw power and destruction that is Godzilla.  I‚Äôm 53 yo woman and remember watching Godzilla on TV with my father. This trailer has such a nostalgic feel to it for me, because it takes the threat that is Godzilla so seriously and it makes you feel  for the people of Japan."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"Haven&#39;t been this excited for a movie since Shin.<br>This looks like it&#39;s going to be an amazing return to form, updated with modern tech and  a much more brutal take.<br><br>Also, I love that shot of the ship flying into a destroyed building. The effects and camerawork are stunning!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"Looks incredible, I got chills. I love how it goes back to the original idea of Godzilla and what it represented post WW2"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-04,"I saw this the night it dropped. Out of any viewable / watchable media content that I&#39;ve seen this year, Godzilla Minus One is special. The whole team behind the movie is amazing. This film has something that has been missing in most media...soul."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=82"">1:22</a><br>Particularly this shot. Everything in this is incredibly harrowing, but seeing Godzilla himself horrifically burnt and scarred is something else. A force of nature, almost crippled, presumably from nuclear attack, is terrifying in itself. <br>this movie is going to swim in dark tones and themes, but that was not something i was expecting"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,Looks incredible !
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,I like the idea of Godzilla being destructive simply by walking around. The other movies haven‚Äôt really done a good job of explaining what his tail does and why his footsteps don‚Äôt cause hell on its own
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-05-05,"Just saw the movie, it left me speechless and in tears, Hollywood can suck it, this is how you make a Godzilla movie. Much thanks to the amazing team that created this masterpiece that will be spoken about for years to come."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I don‚Äôt normally see movies with subtitles in theaters‚Ä¶ but when I do, it‚Äôs GODZILLA! üî• LET‚ÄôS GOOOOOO!!!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"The aspect of Japan being destroyed after World War II immediately caught my attention. It seems toho is not just making Godzilla a horror monster again, but is also being back the tragedy and loss. Something we truest have not had since the original movie."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,This is the Godzilla movie we always needed. Set in Japan and produced by Toho Studios but with cutting edge VFX effects of the Hollywood versions.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-27,This movie was really really good. Definitely one of my top favourite movies of the year. I cried at a few scenes so it was very emotional. Literally a masterpiece movie I loved it so much üò≠
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"Godzilla sure is menacing. The fact that Japan has been increasingly popular with their movie releases these days is just plain outstanding to me. We‚Äôve seen Hollywood make remakes, but with the Japanese entertainment industry, they‚Äôre taking things next level."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I love how this feels like a 50&#39;s era movie, and having Godzilla as an evil force of nature that brings rampage, despair and destruction to the land feels so good man, that&#39;s how he started, and honestly, I prefer him that way"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-06,"I love that they kept the original &#39;54 roar. That one in particular had a profound effect that meshed so well with the original movie. The other roars from King Kong vs Godzilla onward sort of deceased his fear factor despite of it being so iconic. And that was the first roar I heard! When I heard him roar for the first time in the 1954 classic, I was really taken a back because it wasn&#39;t the roar that I was used to. That one was much darker and terrifying than what I heard previously as a kid. The fact that they only used it when it called for it was a great effect, and it didn&#39;t overstay it&#39;s welcome. The terror and bone-chilling feeling of that roar combined with the actions of a horrific monster of gargantuan heights makes me think this is definitely trying to go back to Godzilla&#39;s roots in the most definitive, authentic way possible. Everything else with the setting, the design, the story; it seems this time Godzilla is going to be dark. Way more darker and sinister than he&#39;s ever been. I can&#39;t wait for December 1st"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2024-01-12,I never expected a Godzilla movie to make me cry...
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"WOW. These VFX are stunning. Particularly the physics, weight and power of everything. In particular that ship at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7DqccP1Q_4&amp;t=66"">1:06</a>. Geeked."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I think this is probably gonna be one of, if not THE most gruesome Godzilla movie of the entire franchise. You hardly see anyone getting injured in the old films, but in this trailer alone, you can easily spot like 30+ people just getting wrecked by the damage. It&#39;s insane. Also LOVE a new adaptation of Godzilla being a bad guy again. No crazy fights or anything supernatural or lore with other unique monsters. Just classic Godzilla causing ruthless chaos and destruction. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-10-08,"Not that there is ever a bad time to be a Godzilla fan, but oh my goodness what a time to be a Godzilla fan. <br><br>Godzilla will outlive us all."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-16,Can safely say that this is the Godzilla film we need right now. An absolute triumph of Toho Cinema.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-06,"Im glad TOHO decided to reboot the series again. Shin was fantastic, but really could only stand on its own. This seems to be a return to form for the franchise."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"If we can‚Äôt get a Shin Godzilla sequel, this is easily the next best thing"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"This might be the scariest Godzilla movie ever made. Godzilla looks really awesome, and the destruction scenes look great."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-03,I love this movie! This is a masterpiece.  Humans characters are interesting and i care about them. This movie has heart.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-07,"Godzilla feels like a force of nature that is both the consequences of the atomic bomb and also the natural disasters that always hits Japan like earthquakes and tsunamis. It&#39;s well known that Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Now, this movie seems to be going back to his destructive roots as the wrath of nature since uranium and plutonium the main ingredients for nuclear bombs are both found in nature only to be transformed into a weapon by humans as shown in the Oppenheimer movie."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,&quot;That monster will never forgive us.&quot; That hits so hard.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I really hope this is as good as it looks. The music, the clips, the desperation in the quote ‚ÄúThat monster will never forgive us.‚Äù The implied, defeated spirit of the man being scorned: ‚ÄúEveryone is dead-‚Äú ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a disgrace!‚Äù To the stubborn will to carry on; ‚Äúfight and survive.‚Äù And, the undeniable imagery of Godzilla‚Äôs disastrous rise paralleling the atomic devastation of Japan. It legit tears me up."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-10,This is the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-08,This is true Godzilla. Full circle. The classic returns. Godzilla won movies. It is astronomically impossible to explain how existentialy exited i feel for this. This is perfection.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-10-07,"This looks exactly like the Godzilla movie I&#39;ve always wanted. I try not to get too excited for movies these days since so many are disappointing, but I can&#39;t help but be excited for this. Now please don&#39;t give too much away in endless trailers, let&#39;s keep some spectacle for the actual movie!"
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-08,The way they made Gojira 1954s roar sound so menacing even now is insane.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-11-30,"I&#39;m on my way home from seeing it! Day One. So I won&#39;t say too much other than this: The human script, the visual sights and sounds and the monster action were altogether very awesome! As with Legendary&#39;s Godzilla 2014, this 2023 Toho movie ended with you wanting to see more, but the character of the monster was more true to the original movie&#39;s monster. The monster&#39;s look was about up there with that classic-faced 1964 version. It will be one of my top favorites."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,No one&#39;s gonna talk about how realistic that damn CGI is!? That train smashing made my jaw dropped. This is the Godzilla movie we needed so much!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,Seeing this on number 2 on trending with the most views within 15 hours makes me and a whole lot of Godzilla fans happy I bet
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-05,"It looks incredible.  I wonder what Honda, Nakajima and Tsuburaya would think of their 1954 masterpiece in comparison..  I really love the fact that they hold true to the original aspects of character/storyline while breathing a bit of modern Japanese culture.  I cannot wait to watch this iconic movie in theaters."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-08,I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to TOHO for producing this masterpiece! I hope this success will enable you to continue on telling this story and I&#39;ll be waiting for it as a newly gain fan of yours!<br><br>Domo arigato!
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,"I love seeing this return to form for Godzilla. Pure hatred, pure vengeance. A wild animal lashing out in rage at all of humanity for the horrors of war."
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-04,Japan in 1947: Things couldn&#39;t get any worse!<br><br>Godzilla:
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-07,This looks amazing. I love where Takashi Yamazaki is taking Godzilla in this movie. This looks like it‚Äôs going to be a more serious film in the franchise like the original 1954 movie directed by Ishiro Honda. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to seeing this Godzilla Minus One when it comes out in theaters. This truly is a great time to be a Godzilla fan.
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-12-01,Can you believe this movie was made with a budget of 15 million??
Godzilla Minus One,r7DqccP1Q_4,2023-09-26,"I love how this film looks like it&#39;s come full-circle back to the original film. If not an outright remake, it definitely feels like genuine homage. I&#39;m excited to see it."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,I&#39;m impressed. The idea for the story about the actual GT Academy Events is really authentic. Good job Sony and Polyphony Digital
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"&quot;I know this track, I&#39;ve raced it a thousand times&quot;. Only a GT fan knows that feeling. üòä"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"‚ÄúI know this track, I‚Äôve raced it a thousand times‚Äù  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVPzGBvPrzw&amp;t=136"">2:16</a>  gives me chills all the time. <br><br>I know what it‚Äôs like to play the same track over and over. Failing and failing then finally nailing it and now this guy gets to experience it in real life! Amazing trailer, can‚Äôt wait for the movie."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-11-26,"As a gamer and a racing fan, the movie was something which couldn&#39;t be described, like the roller coaster of emotions, wish I could watch it again for the first time."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"This looks pretty good actually. I was kinda skeptical but it&#39;s way better than I thought, it seems really a belivable story, great trailer."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"As a GT player, I feel like it will be so easy for me to relate to the protagonist and get immersed in his story. A few months ago I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this project. Now I&#39;m excited."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,People like Jimmy Broadbent have shown that you can go from a sim racer to a real racer and do well at it. Glad to see a movie being made about a story like that.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-28,This is one of the few times I&#39;ve seen an entire movie theater go nuts at the end of a movie. Absolutely fantastic. I really hope we get more video game movies with this type of quality.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Total trust in Neil Blomkamp for this ! This is a really interesting, actual and exciting point of view. I&#39;m sure that the images on track will be breathtaking"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-06,"I haven&#39;t seen a film that actually portrays racing as something like a sport in so so long, way to go!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-11-25,This movie made me cry. It&#39;s so relatable to life. No Marvels or Flash movie can beat this emotional rollercoaster.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-28,Holy crap this movie was actually really good. It really went above and beyond my expectations. I&#39;d highly recommend it and id honestly watch it again
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-07,"Being honest. I played racing games for years, and a week before my driving test was the first time I hopped in a car. I passed the test. Everything felt so natural. In some sense I can relate to this."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,Love seeing motorsport culture in the limelight! ü§©üèÅ
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,This looks awesome!!üòéüòé
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-28,"As someone who knew little to nothing about the games and was so sick of seeing the trailer every time I went to see something else,this is by far the biggest surprise I‚Äôve seen all year. While any film that is based or inspired on a true story is most likely more fake than actually true,it‚Äôs still a well written film just on its own. The character development and acting is really strong and can get quite emotional. The racing sequences have a unique style to them that remain both intense and fun at the same time. With all that being said,It‚Äôs a really well made film based off of a real life story and a video game at the same time. It blends so much together and manages to balance it out quite nicely. Definitely one I‚Äôd rewatch many times in the future and hopefully one that doesn‚Äôt remain forgotten."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Going so far to take a gamer and let him drive real race tracks is already something. But this is not fiction, this really happens out there and we see another monumental step that is him getting a whole movie about pretty much his life (with more or less action scenes and drama added to it). I cant imagine the rollercoaster this guys been on... Thanks for believing in gamers!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Whether you&#39;re a gaming fan, racing fan or just a person in general, there is something adrenaline pumping watching cars racing at high speeds incredibly close to each other and the limit. Love the game, definitely looking forward to the movie"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-22,"just got back from the cinema, and safe to say, this was an absolute gem of a movie! would definitely watch it again!!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,I played Gran Turismo when I was a kid and it gave me a great appreciation for the sport of European car racing and will always has a special place in my heart. This film looks like it sticks to the source material.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-07,A video game movie that doesn‚Äôt shy away from where it comes from but leans into it is always in my book a must see.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,This genuinely is better than what I was expecting
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2024-04-27,‚ÄúThat crash is not going to define who you are. But how you respond to it will..‚Äù<br><br>Fave quote from the movie. Words to live by.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"This movie will be epic.<br>All Millennials remember GT1 and how groundbreaking it was. Getting the A class license after 100&#39;s of hours actually helps with real life driving as well, there were game mechanics so unforgiving it ingrains self control in your head, I feel it when I&#39;m speeding after midnight on the highway."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-06-22,"I&#39;m not a Gran Turismo fan, but just being a gamer in general. This brought tears into my eyes."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Out of left field. Did not expect this to be dope, and Neil directing means this should be incredible."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-12-11,"I just saw the movie and it was EPIC! The soundtrack, the cars, the character literally got me in the driver&#39;s seat like when i was a kid playing gran turismo 3 in my Evo! Highly recommended!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"I have to admit I‚Äôm impressed. When I heard they were making Gran Turismo (a game that I love) into a movie, I was skeptical. But I really like the premise of this movie and now I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,This GT movie is gonna be just THIS GOOD as the game itself!
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,Neil Blomkamp directed District 9! Best believe it will be a banger!üî•üî•üî•
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-24,"Anyone who&#39;s on the fence about seeing this movie, go. It was fucking awesome. I was going in with average hopes for a decent movie, but it actually surpassed them. The actors were great, the editing and cinematography was top notch and the racing was incredibly done. Being a gamer / fan of Playstation only helped my enjoyment, but even if you&#39;re not a hardcore gamer you&#39;ll find a lot to love here. 8.5/10 for me."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"When I clicked on this I thought it would look awful, but now I&#39;m hyped and actually want to watch it!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,So dope. When I was kid and I destroyed GT2. This was the dream in my head that I never thought could actually happen. Amazing. And what an incredible director. One of my favorites.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-06,Neil Blomkamp has always been a promising director and criminally underrated ever since his debut. Glad to see him behind this. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic job.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-05,It&#39;s so sad that this gem of a movie is gonna stay underrated.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-06,"How did Sony manage to keep something looking this good a secret in this day and age? This looks pleasantly surprising, keep up the good work Sony!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Looks pretty dope, but remember &quot;keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed&quot; - Kratos"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Having watched Jann&#39;s story from the beginning of the first academy trial video, his accident at the nurburgring, and his le mans attempts with Nissan, this movie is very exciting, and very surreal."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-21,"Just took my 15 year old (gamer) son to this - what an EPIC, great movie to see with him!  Everything about this movie was top quality.  the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the music...can&#39;t say enough good things about this film other than go see it."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,Neill Blomkamp was not expecting that. This looks actually solid af‚ù§
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Director is actually great, his vision very clear and accurate. This movie is gonna be next level in racing genre üî•üî•üî•"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,More car movies like this are definitely neededü§©. The fact that its based on a true story is just madüôåüèΩ
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-25,"Just saw this film! It was A LOT of fun! I was the only person in the theater, a matinee! lol!  It was a perfect movie, IMO! It contained all the right things, and none of the crap things! And it&#39;s a true story! That makes it THE BEST entertainment IMO. Thank You all for bringing it to the big screen! üß°"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-14,"This brought tears to my eyes. I remember playing Gran Turismo to help with my driving lessons. When used with the steering wheel set, it felt as real as it gets and helped me a great deal - held my license for 10 years plus now and this game helped a great deal. Watched this movie and it is awesome - A must-see!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-06-10,"As a gamer and someone who played PlayStation as a kid so much in the early 2000s-2010,   I have to say this brings back memories.  So hyped for this"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"This story about a real Sim racer is what actually starred online sim racing. In my opinion the Grand Turismo Academy was way ahead of what is happening today , and  actually turned gamers into real racers. <br>This Nissan PlayStation GT Academy started the first challenge in 2008. It was very popular in its day."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-05,"Just saw it today and it was even way better than what the trailer depicts or what I initially expected! The story line, the action, the drama was intense and emotional as well which is what makes this movie so awesome!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Finally, a movie studio and a game studio that both get what it takes to make a movie about gaming. Here&#39;s to hoping the final result is as good as the trailer."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-05,So stoked for this!
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"I would watch this in a heartbeat, adaptation from gamer to real life, very cool concept, elements of a true story and a rags to riches tale to boot, sign me up, this is the stuff dreams are made of!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-12-27,"Anger, happiness, laughter, crying, falling down and getting up again. Goosebumps from start to finish. This movie is one of the very few in the history of cinematography that has everything real life has to offer, because life itself writes the best stories. And it didn&#39;t feel like it was only addressed to the gamers, racers and motorsport fans. Not at all. So many thanks Gran Turismo ;)"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,Has absolutely no right to look as good as it does for a video game movie. Bravo because this has some magical looking elements and truly looks like it could pull of something special for the video game/ movie franchise and community! üî•üî•üî•
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-11,"If you suspect that in this movie, there‚Äôs a lot of racing, you‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs way more than a lot. If you love game, you would love the movie."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,No way this looks far better than I expected. I‚Äôm actually excited to see this
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2024-02-10,"Im no longer a big gamer as I was in my teens &amp; 20s. But I can say never underestimate what a gamer knows....I was a big time jet fighting gamer. I love flight. Then 1 day, my ex-wife got me an xmas gift. It was a lesson &quot;Intro to flight&quot; at our airport. Me &amp; an instructor were paired up in a single engine Cessna. Instructor wanted to see what I know by identifying parts &amp; gauges on the plane. Then wanted to know how I knew alot when I had never flown before. I told him through games. He was shocked and laughed. Then we joked about how parents say &quot;youll never learn anything by playing games all day&quot;. Guess that was slightly false."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-20,"I got out of the cinema yesterday, stopped on a bench and cried my eyes out. How many of us actually have something to pour our hearts into, besides just pretending we&#39;re living our lives? The only question I&#39;m asking myself now is - which is my race? Probably, a movie that will never let me live comfortably until I find that childhood dream again."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,This is actually really freaking good! I am genuinely hyped for this! Good job Sony!
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"As a Gran Turismo 4 fan, I cannot believe this is real. I always kinda had that dream back in the day with GT4, obviously real life is real life, but glad to see a movie out of this &quot;dream&quot; most of us internally have when playing Gran Turismo !!!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-01,"Just got back from watching this brilliant movie, don‚Äôt listen to any other people just watch it yourself 11/10"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-04,"Been playing GT since GT3 A-Spec, and now, finding out it&#39;s going to have a film is beyond nostalgic for me. I can&#39;t wait!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Nearly had me crying, granturismo been my life since I started playing at 10 years old with granturismo 2 ... I actually qualified for &quot;granturismo academy&quot; with my controller in 77th places with millions players .. but they took just the first 10 üò¢ I&#39;ll watch this movie definitely"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Getting GT7 and a PS4 has paid off for me. NOW I&#39;m up to see this movie with my best friend. She saw the sneak peek, and saw the GTR."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-10-04,"I just finished the movie and man.. As a gamer myself i was completely glued to my seat. I&#39;ts been a long time since i&#39;ve shed a tear, or yelled or jumped of joy watching a movie, but this one made it happen. Absolutely phenomenal! <br><br>More of these kinda movies! üî•"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"I&#39;m used to seeing a Neill Blomkamp directed feature as being realistic and gritty. This looks realistic and squeaky clean. Nice to see he&#39;s not a one trick pony. It&#39;s just the way you&#39;d expect Gran Turismo to look. I know Sony and Polyphony Digital must&#39;ve had a lot of say in the appearance and production of the movie. It&#39;s a great collaboration that, so far, looks to really be paying off. Looking forward to seeing how this one turns out..."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-05,From a childhood game to a movie?! I&#39;m definitely gonna watch it!
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-05,"As a 14.000 hours Gran Turismo player, I gotta say this gave me goosebumps. Wanted to apply to GT Academy a few years ago, yet some family issues made me stay put... feel sorry for that oportunity even in the present day...<br>To everyone outhere, chase your dreams, don&#39;t let it slip!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-28,"Okay, this movie was amazing. THIS is the type of movie you go to the cinema to see. Box-office worthy, captivating and has you rooting for the underdog &lt;3"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-06,I love how this movie is based on the games but also based on a true story
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,It&#39;s even more AMAZING that this is based on a REAL story<br>Jann Mardenborough&#39;s career üí•
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-07,I remember watching the documentary on this I was blown away by the fact how radical the idea was and how it paid off hopefully the movie does it justice trailer looks awesome
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-10,This movie is 100 times better than the trailer. Not many hollywood movies can do that nowadays.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Imagine the soundtrack of this film composed by the original songs from the games, like, from Gran Turismo 4 and 2, it would be beautiful"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"I like how this looks actually. Just enough to be different and not too far off from how people see the sim racing vs. real world thing. HOPEFULLY the main characters can carry the story as well as the heavy hitters, but I think this is one i&#39;ll actually go to the theaters for!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"So, this is not a trailer, this is a summary of the whole movie"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-26,Just saw this movie with my son. Amazing story line and action. Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a while
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"I was an extra in this film, a pit bench engineer for Team Ford at the Red Bull Ring, and I&#39;m really looking forward to watching this movie :-) It was a great experience beeing a small part of this project! Visit us at the Red Bull Driving Experience!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,This looks legitimately good. I cannot wait for this to come out
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-07-24,in love with the scene in the video where the pistons are so fast and the car just roars around the track gives me goosebumps every time
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2025-02-15,"Surprisingly good movie - I‚Äôm a petrolhead and those racing shots/car shots were very good delivered üëå Great music, great story, editing/cinematography, top! Highly recommended for every motorsports fan"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-06-10,"As a fan of gran turismo, this exceeds levels of unexpected"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Can‚Äôt wait for this, finally a proper car orientated movie we haven‚Äôt had in a long time"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-06-17,Being a Generation X&#39;er I grew up with this game when it originally launched on the 1st Playstation back in the 90&#39;s and have seen it evolve into what it is now over the years. Thank you for finally fulfilling a childhood dream of turning it into a movie. I&#39;m definitely going to watch this when it is released!
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2024-05-09,I was one of the skeptics. Do yourself a favour and watch this magnificent film asap 10/10
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Its a subject close to my heart, coming from a family that can&#39;t even afford a car and wanting to go racing myself - GT was my only way and I wish I had what Jann&#39;s generation has in terms of e-sports to help them show that the instincts and talent are lurking undetected in so many people who never get the chance. He did a service to all future generations and showed there is another way in, and to take e-sports seriously. Thankyou Jann."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"i love how they put the game footage from GT7 as well. also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVPzGBvPrzw&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> it could a teaser for the training/license tests us GT players went through"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"I don&#39;t typically like any kind of racer, but GT7 on PSVR2 is unreal. Takes the game to the next level when you&#39;re actually in the car"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2024-07-03,The part when his dad came into his trailer and was crying man made me cry such good acting
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"Oh shit, this actually looks pretty good."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,"Being addicted to GT7, im glad to see the whole franchise receiving a movie adaptation that doesn‚Äôt even look half bad! Kaz-san will be proud!"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,I can already tell this will be better than Need for Speed. A great approach to telling this story and I&#39;m even more excited that Neil Blomkamp is behind the camera.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,As a lifelong fan of the Franchise I can‚Äôt wait to sit in a theater and watch this.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-27,"I watched this movie, and i loved it. The backstories and the way i see myself in the character Jann are so similar to my life.<br>It basically showed how my life is currently and what i want to achieve. My parents were always either too caring or didn&#39;t care about me at all, wanted me to try out different things than gaming that i didnt like, and they thought everything i did was a mistake and my dreams would never come through. After this movie i know to still follow my heart even after everything, because even us gamers and people who don&#39;t really have a goal can achieve something just like this."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-06-03,"I remember seeing this guy on a documentary a decade ago when I was a kid, it‚Äôs crazy to think that he‚Äôs now getting a film made about his life"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-03,This trailer looks lit .. the transitions from game to live action and vice versa is seamless .. very excited
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-17,"What a great film. I didn&#39;t think a movie like this was even possible this year. Definitely Top Gun/Karate Kid vibes. Solid story, surprisingly good performances and completely devoid of the MESSAGE. Nothing really exceptional here but it hits all the right beats."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-08-28,"After i watched the movie in the cinema, all of the viewers gave a standing ovation to this legendary movie‚Ä¶ million time better than the trailer itself."
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,"I am absolutely hyped for this, I loved Gran Turismo so much as a kid and seeing a movie being made just makes me so excited! üôå"
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-07,This movie is 100% fan service and I&#39;m all about it. I will definitely watch it.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-05-02,I remember watching the GT academy series long ago and seeing the rise of Jan Maldenborough. Its amazing to finally show the general population this rise and significance of what He and Gran Turismo achieved to prove that console gaming wasn&#39;t a waste of time and could teach transferable skills. <br>It shows the the level of technology (ps3 era? GT5?) was good then and to think the advancements made to now.
Gran Turismo,GVPzGBvPrzw,2023-09-01,"As a fan of the Gran Turismo game series ever since its first inception, this Gran Turismo movie plays full and proper homage to the series! <br><br>The storyline is based on the true story which is simple to follow but most of all sticking very true to the roots of the Gran Turismo game series. <br><br>The seemless transitioning between reality and game in the movie that also weaves together beautifully with the storyline makes it easy for any viewer (even non-gamers like my dad).... to understand Gran Turismo... both the purpose of the game and point of this movie.<br><br>The movie itself is awesome with the superb directing by Neil Blomkamp and of course solid performances from the ensemble cast consisting of Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Djimon Hounsou, Geri Halliwell Horner and the rest who make this movie a perfectly crafted and charismatic film that not only exhilarates but inspires. <br><br>It was a fun, keeps-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat kind of movie with the right amount of emotion from it&#39;s storyline till the very end. <br><br>But I was emotional not just for storyline here but the way this movie silently pays tribute and makes you appreciate Gran Turismo, racing simulation, racing in general, and of course... cars.<br><br>In a world where now everyone pretty much drives in SUVs and sitting in the back of Ubers....this movie will remind you that... <br><br>There is still hope,<br><br>There is the open road, <br><br>There is the spirit of driving, <br><br>There is the essence of cars and racing, <br><br>And most of all... There is Gran Turismo <br><br>So far, it is easily the movie of the year for me. Well done, because this is awesome! <br><br>Highly recommend it!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"FYI: this is NOT a remake of the original movie, it is an adaptation of the tony award winning broadway musical version. the musical is much more closer to the book than the original movie. the musical is vastly different from the original so there is nothing to worry about. this movie will be its own thing. this new version and the original are two completely different movies. both can co-exist without diminishing the other. i think this movie will be amazing and i have no doubt in my mind that it will be a huge success"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"Whew. The way Fantasias voice came in, the eyes welled up and my goosebumps raised. She should have won a TONY for her portrayal and she better not get robbed for her Oscar."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"I pray that this opens the doors of super stardom for Fantasia. She deserves it, she&#39;s worked so hard and I want the best for her"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-10-16,"The whole cast lineup is amazing, but tbh I&#39;m mainly excited to hear Fantasia sing again. I got emotional just hearing her sing in this trailer."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I‚Äôm over here freaking out.  I hope this movie gives my girl Fantasia all the praise and recognition she‚Äôs been so deserving of for so long.  Can‚Äôt wait.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"Halle Bailey literally went from singing songs at home on YouTube with her sister, to starring in two of the biggest movies of the year. How incredible, what a gorgeous cast of black excellence. üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüëèüèæ"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-25,"I was the Medic for this production.  Let me just say, I saw the day to day work.  Fantasia will surprise a lot of people.  Fantastic moment for her!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2024-02-18,Fantasia had me crying all through the film. She is a phenomenal singer and actress. Her voice seems a little deeper and  just as incredible as ever.  I love her so much. I pray she wins an Oscar. She so deserves it üôèüèΩ
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,If Fantasia don&#39;t sing!!! I remember when she performed this song at the Tony Awards. One of my favorites of hers ever ü§óüôèüèæ
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,Fantasia having her full-circle moment! She totally deserves it! Love her!!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I never thought i would see Fantasia step back into this iconic role! I‚Äôm seeing this for this ensemble
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2024-01-27,"Wow‚Ä¶that was THE best movie I‚Äôve seen. Period. Not usually a big fan of musicals, but the music in this was brilliant. I‚Äôm astonished that it hasn‚Äôt garnered more award nominations. And this isn‚Äôt a black thing: I‚Äôm a 64-year-old white Aussie and it was just the best thing I‚Äôve seen in years."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"God I hope they give Fantasia room to shine in this movie, she&#39;s got the potential to give an Oscar worthy performance here.  If this movie is as good as this trailer implies, I expect nothing short of perfection from her. She has the talent and the voice and  charisma to pull it off."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"As a fan of Fantasia, I‚Äôm soooooo damn Proud of her, everything she‚Äôs been through has lead her to this beautiful point‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so happy for her and just know this moment is going to change her life."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-25,"People were so worried about Halle playing Ariel... Meanwhile, she snuck an entire movie in without us even knowing! üòÇ I love you Halle! ‚ù§"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-10-13,nothing can replace the original film. thinking of different parts of it could make me cry on the spot. i watch that movie and bawlllll and bawlllll damn i love that movie
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,This brought me to tears just seeing this. I can‚Äôt wait to see it on the big screen. This cast isn‚Äôt going to deliver nothing short of amazing. This is going to be epic. Tasia girl it‚Äôs your time love. I could feel all the emotions in each note sang.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,I was lucky enough to see the Broadway production of The Color Purple in NYC starring Fantasia years ago. My Mom and I were in tears during Fantasia&#39;s solos. This is going to be great!!!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"I saw Fantasia on Broadway in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;.  So glad she reprised the role for the movie musical version.  Her voice is magnificent. And I didn&#39;t know Taraji P. Henson could sing, she never sang on &quot;Empire&quot;.  Great choice for Suge Avery.   Looking forward to the movie.  üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-27,Saw this movie today. Didn‚Äôt even know Fantasia could act. This was a phenomenal take/musical. They did an outstanding job. I loved it so much.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-07-14,Just the trailer and I&#39;m crying already.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,From The Little Mermaid to a musical adaptation of The Colour Purple Halle Bailey is definitely on her way up to international stardom.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"&quot;The Color Purple&quot; is a true masterpiece in the making! This trailer has left me speechless and captivated by its powerful storytelling. The all-star cast, led by the incredible Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Colman Domingo, brings Alice Walker&#39;s beloved classic to life with such grace and authenticity. Kudos to director Blitz Bazawule for his bold vision and the remarkable team behind the scenes who have poured their hearts into this production. I&#39;m eagerly counting down the days until December 25th when I can experience the unbreakable bond of sisterhood and immerse myself in this reimagined world. Bravo, Warner Bros. Pictures, for bringing us this extraordinary film!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-08-04,"I mean... Fantasia is just gold... She deserves the world, I feel like I&#39;ll cry like a baby on the theater"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,Who else is ready to see Fantasia shine?!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,I have watched this trailer 10 times and I got goosebumps each time. Fantasia???? Her pipes have always been immaculate!!! Gorgeous and perfect casting!!! ‚ù§
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,Halle‚Äôs really showing us she‚Äôs not a one-trick pony. She‚Äôs not just a disney princess (which she embodies perfectly). C‚Äômon actress! Can‚Äôt wait to see this. So in love with the entire cast
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-26,"I just got home from watching this movie. Amazing, and I can&#39;t wait to see it again. Nice to see Fantasia in this. Always loved her singing."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,Fantasia was born to play this role! I&#39;m so thrilled for her.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,OMG. I am sobbing from this trailer. Fantasia&#39;s voice. One of my favorite stories and films.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"I saw Fantasia perform this role on Broadyway. Not a bootleg on YT. I was in the 6th row. CHILLS! Even if she doesn&#39;t sing, trust that she can play this role!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-27,"I just saw the movie Taraji Did Her Thing, she continues to show her versatility."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"man, I did not expect this musical, of all things, to become a movie.<br>I think it&#39;s got a ton of potential, and I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re getting another musical movie this year."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-06-10,"Taraji, Fantasia, Halle... some of my absolute faves in 1 project. Fingers crossed that it delivers as it should"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,I didn&#39;t even realize that was H.E.R! This cast is amazing and I cannot wait to see this! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s in theaters and not straight to streaming. This deserves a big screen!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-23,"Fantasia&#39;s vocals just gives me, the chills. What a very anointing voice, she has. &amp;&amp; they have all the best actors and actresses, in this movie. I&#39;m so excited and I can&#39;t wait to see it!!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,Im here for both fantasia and Halle  ......especially Halle...I hope Halle goes all the way to the top in the film industry because she is a force to be reconed with
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I saw Fantasia play this role here in Chicago. She didn&#39;t act it. She LIVED it. I am too excited!!!!!!!!!!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"Fantasia is such amazing singer. Like, really, she sings that fantastically. And already this movie is amazing. All of the warmth, and all the joy and all the triumph is all there in this film. I can&#39;t wait for this epic journey of the new take of this beloved classic."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-09-16,Fantasia and Halle are the nation&#39;s best singers right now. They have the soulfulness of Whitney Houston. I&#39;m glad seeing Halle getting so much work and lighting up the screen with her divine presence. And Fantasia has been so underrated - she is The Voice. üëëüôèüèª‚ù§
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,"I just watched Oprah, Fantasia, Tarija, watching the trailer and It brought me to tears. I am so excited for Fantasia, she is so deserving! This is her full circle moment!! As soon as tics are available I&#39;m getting a ring side seat!!"

I just watched it and to know what all those wonderful actresses went through to make this movie, made  my eyes about 5 times throughout the movie?<br>Gotta see it‚ù§"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I get that Halle is the lady of the moment (&amp; is heavily featured in the trailer) BUT Fantasia needs more love in this comment section for carrying the trailer with those stellar vocals!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,You had me at Fantasia! I love the other ladies also! I was blessed to see Fantasia in the Color Purple years ago at the Foxx Theater in Atlanta and she brought the house down!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,Fantasia&#39;s voice is definately top 10 - 20 all time. &amp; thats saying something given how many great singers there have been over the last century
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2024-01-05,"I just came from seeing the movie and I loved it so much! I laughed, I cried; I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the music! Amazing! I foresee awards in the future."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-07-05,"I want to see it, but I&#39;m going to have a hard time trying not to compare every actor, scene, and choice in direction to the original. It was so memorable and stellar that the entire movie is solidified in my head."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,Seeing Fantasia gives me proud mom feels! Ive been a fan since day one on Idol and I&#39;ve followed her every since. Can&#39;t wait to see her and some of the others get that Golden Globe recognition!

The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-05,Watched the screening last night and my heart was so full! I can&#39;t wait to see it again! Fantasia was beyond phenomenal! And Halle was so amazing in it!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,"I have been a fan of Halle and her sister for several years. Their performance of the Star Spangled Banner showcased their skill and talent. If you haven&#39;t seen that, you must!! So happy for her!!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-25,Halle is doing THINGS! Can‚Äôt wait to see her and Fantasia in the film. ‚ù§

The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,"I can&#39;t wait. I&#39;m already crying. Love to Oprah, Steven S., Quincy Q, the whole cast. Much love to my girl, Fantasia. I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time to see Tasia on the big screen. I&#39;m in tears."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,Halle Bailey is gonna shine in the movies! She is gonna be great in The Little Mermaid remake and she looks like she is gonna do great in this movie too!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"Me being happy to see the musical and playing in it in high school and now seeing this version in theaters is one thing‚Ä¶..<br><br><br><br><br>But Spielberg, Oprah and Quincy producing it is another level."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-12-26,"I saw this movie today, Christmas Day.<br>It is a fantastic movie, and i recommend seeing it."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I really thought this was a remake to the classic film but it&#39;s a musical and that&#39;s totally fine with me but I feel like Fantasia is going to killed it as Cecily and Oscars here we come! Cause I know this whole entire cast  will deliver a performance of a &quot;Lifetime&quot; üëè‚ù§üî•
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-30,Why did this bring tears to my eyes? I already know that this cast is going to be incredible
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-06-02,"And the Oscar goes to‚Ä¶ FANTASIA BARRINO! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I can already hear it. She better get her due. She has worked hard for so long and been through so much. This is the role of her career, and I hope they recognize it!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2024-04-15,I remember sitting in the theater last year and this trailer came on before the movie. I started crying. I went on to see this movie 3 times in theaters.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,"This trailer is just a work of art. Whoever edited it should be very proud. The 2 shots of shug (still and then dancing) followed by the cut to the quincy jones slide is so impactful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=71"">1:11</a>  As well as the faster raised hands sequence bouncing from the waterfall to the church then taraji henson slide. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> ‚ù§ <br><br>Also the bright sunny shot of halle dancing followed by an immediate cut to black ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPwzBUui1GA&amp;t=100"">1:40</a>"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-24,This brought me to tears!!! I‚Äôve always wanted to see the musical and I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie. The cast looks phenomenal!! Can‚Äôt wait!!!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-23,"This is the first time I&#39;ve seen anything from the musical, I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about but the voice of Fantasia Barrino, which is so beautiful, the lyrics of the song, the cinematography so great, and seeing that the past is to be forgotten, made me cry, never I had cried over a trailer<br><br>i&#39;m so excited to see this"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-10-15,"Oh my goodness the trailer itself has me emotional. The original Color Purple movie is one of my favorite all time movies. I remember the 1st time I watched it at the age of 13 yrs old in 1998 I was at awe. I was 3 yrs old when the original movie came out.  I would make my PaPa sit and watch the original movie over and over again with me. I could tell he would get irritated with me. Lol! That is one of the great memories that I will always cherish that I had with my grandfather. So seeing that it comes out on Christmas my favorite and true holiday, I am going to be a emotional wreck sitting there in the movie theatre Christmas day God willing, just happy and crying tears of joy. Blessings, love, and hugs everyone. Be safe. üíú"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,One just damn know well that this will not disappoint because it‚Äôs coming from the producers of BOTH the film and the musical!

The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"This is not a REMAKE of the original 1985 film, it‚Äôs an adaptation of the stage musical. Thought everyone should know. I‚Äôm actually interested in seeing this, it‚Äôs looks so good!!"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,This movie better sweep the Oscars next year! üíú
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"Saw the Broadway show with Fantasia. I cannot wait to see the movie adaptation. I‚Äôm Here brings me to tears every time I hear Fantasia sing it. And go Halle. Not only is she making moves, she appears to be making the right moves"

The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,I‚Äôm at work screaming this is about to be GOOD!! Let‚Äôs go FANTASIA
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,Totally looking forward to this.  The Broadway musical was amazing!  And they have such an amazing cast.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-09-05,"Fantasia is one of only a few artists with a rich, distict voice that carries soul in every note."
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,So proud of Halle.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-06-13,Who else started crying as soon as Fantasia started singing? Can&#39;t wait to see her and Joe in concert!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,"this is what I call a stellar cast, but I feel viola should be too. I am so looking forward to it.  I make a point of living the whole experience in theaters! üò≠‚ù§üáßüá∑"
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2024-03-12,I never write anything on YouTube or whatsoever platform but I got to say for this masterpiece I must say I went into every emotions (mostly crying throughout most of the movie tho but that&#39;s fine lol). The songs are incredible and already downloaded the album on Spotify!!! I have loved everything about this art! Please make yourself a favor and watch it if you like musicals. Big love on Fantasia that I thought was incredible and unique in this. 10 out of 10 for me
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,This cast is excellent! The trailer got me sold immediately! I‚Äôm seated day one!!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,Fantasia gets me every time üò¢ My girl better rack up during the award season!!! Love seeing Danielle as Sophia!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,Halle Bailey is blowing up on the scene.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-08-10,Everytime I see this trailer it gives me chills. Especially when Halle says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre at the center of the universe‚Äù.
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-22,First The Little Mermaid and now this?! Halle Bailey is on a roll!
The Color Purple,wPwzBUui1GA,2023-05-25,It&#39;s nice to see two Disney princesses in one film. Halle (Ariel) and H.E.R. (Belle)
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-23,"I like how the person in the beginning sets up a very obviously creepy atmosphere with the blinking red light in the dark room, and says ‚Äúsee? It‚Äôs not scary‚Äù"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,‚ÄúMonsters are real. They live inside us and sometimes they win.‚Äù -Stephen King.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,"I read this short story by Stephen King in his ‚ÄúNight Shift‚Äù book and it truly terrified me. Most of the setting takes place in a psychiatrist‚Äôs office while the children‚Äôs father narrates the entire story while lying on a couch, as his doctor listens and writes notes. Very scary twist at the end, too. Hope this film gives it justice! ‚ù§"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-07,&quot;It&#39;s the thing that comes for your kids when you&#39;re not paying attention&quot;<br>That sends chills down my spine...
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,John Wick&#39;s childhood
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-07,"Well, John is not exactly the boogeyman, he is the one you call to kill the boogeyman."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,We need a Boogeyman 2 where John Wick and The Boogeyman come face to face in a battle of the ages.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-10-29,This is the best horror film I‚Äôve seen in a looooooong old time. Plays on all of your childhood fears and phobias and sends chills down your spine. Definitely recommend
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,Vivian absolutely deserves more roles
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,This trailer is fantastic! The use of music and humming is literally perfect especially when you look at how it&#39;s cut up in editing. Also not giving that much away for a horror movie trailer is key. Look at The Barbarian! As a marketing student this trailer gives me a big smile!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,"Vivian absolutely deserves more roles, gifted and well spoken actress"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-21,"This is one of my favorite horror movies I‚Äôve seen. Most plots are cheesy and not well built, they only focus on jump scares. The way they surrounded the boogeyman with mystery and finally unveiled him at the very end really makes this movie a must watch and unique. The right amount of jump scares with great acting. 9/10"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,So proud of Sophie Thatcher. She&#39;s quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,I love when they put little kids in danger in horror movies
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,Now that&#39;s a good trailer. Can&#39;t wait for it ....Goosebumps.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-12,"Im not someone that gets scared of horror movies, but omg this one was so well done and terrifying! No cheap jumpscares, no cringeworthy CGI or failed special effects,,, the monster was genuinely well orchestrated and scary. Would def watch again and recommend."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,Keanu is really stealthy in this one.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-22,A bedtime story turns into a horror movie this actually has lots of potential to be great
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"Well, John wasn&#39;t exactly the boogeyman....<br>He is the one you send to <b>kill</b> the fhuckin boogeyman"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-05,I saw this movie in theaters. It was absolutely terrifying I loved it
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-20,The closet door part actually gave me goosebumps. Hopefully the movie holds up.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,Sophie Thatcher is incredible.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-20,"Saw the test screening in a PACKED theater and never have I seen so many folks jump, scream and do it as often in a movie as they did for this! Easiest in my top 3 theater going experiences EVER. I‚Äôm a 45 year old man and love going to the movies so I‚Äôve seen TONS of scary movies and NONE hit as hard as this did!!! So much fun I‚Äôm definitely going again!!!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-02,Just went to see this and it was even better than I expected plenty of jump scares and just a really good horror movie.   1-10 I give it a 8 .
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-03,Love the nod to the number 19 at the end on the house. Any avid Stephen king fan knows the importance of number 19. This short story was pretty good! Hoping the film does it justice
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"one of stephen kings greatest stories, simple &amp; highly effective &amp; haunting, have always wanted every story in the night shift collection to be a movie. looking good with sophie thatcher &amp; baby girl leia &amp; spooky af!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"Finally, a John Wick origin movie."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-26,I literally can&#39;t wait for it to hit the cinemas. Stephen King is amazing all over.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-24,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the thing that comes for your kids when you‚Äôre not paying attention‚Äù awesome line for a horror movie!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,stephen king and the producers of stranger things?this movie is bound to be good
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-06,"Boogeyman 3 was the first horror movie I ever watched growing up. I‚Äôm 22 now. This gave me chills, and not the good kindüò∞"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-10-23,WOW! I am about to watch this now. It looks super good.  That is the adorable cute little girl from Bird Box. She is really talented. This story seems like something I would write.üòçü•∞‚ù§
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-20,When people at the test screenings screamed so much they had to recut it you know it&#39;s gonna be a good one üò±
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"I love when the sister says that there&#39;s no such thing as monsters right before she&#39;s attacked by one. They actually hide beneath the dark and blind spots in this world, all you got to do is close your eyes or even look yourself in the mirror to find them."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"Sophie Thatcher is a huge talent.. I&#39;ve been a fan of her since Prospect (2018), she was amazing there alongside Pedro Pascal"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-09,I just watched the movie in theater and it was a horror from the beginning to the end. Acting is brilliant and the visuals amazing. As a grown man I made sure my light was on when I got home...
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-05,"A horror trailer that actually gives me goosebumps &amp; having me wanting to see it. Well done. <br><br>It‚Äôs been years since a good horror trailer has been well made.üî•<br><br>EDIT: I‚Äôve seen the movie. Enjoyed it. Some jump scares got me. Some predictable/ some not. The atmosphere was great. So was the sound effects. <br><br>It gave me Stranger Things/ Lights Out vibes. The way the movie started has given me chills. I give it a 8/10. Wasn‚Äôt the best/ worst but I pretty much enjoyed it. The creature design was pretty cool. (üö®SPOILER ALERTüö®)Also, the way the creature threw the girl at the tv was both jaw dropping &amp; hilarious. <br><br>If your a fan of Creature Features. Definitely would recommend!üí™üèΩ"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-24,Finally! A Boogeyman movie that‚Äôs actually scary
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-04,Just watched. It&#39;s actually pretty good. The problem is it&#39;s just too dark that it&#39;s hard to see what&#39;s happening during the scares and the action scenes. But overall worth the watch
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"FED UP WITH  SLASH HORROR , THIS MIGHT RETURN THE CLASSIC HORROR TASTE."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,The scene with the TV reminded me the old good POLTERGEIST of the 80s.<br>The golden era of the good chilling thrillers.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-06,this was hands down the scariest thing I ever read from King. I read it at summer camp in a room with no less than 10 closet doors. That kind of room where one wall is all doors. <del>shivers</del> that room went from ok feeling to the scariest place in the world in one short story. lol I was also like 11 or 12 years old. üòä
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2024-09-30,Every boogeyman is a boogeyman until baba yaga steps in with a pencil..... A F*cking Pencil !!!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-28,This ‚Ä¶. I like this. Original scary movie energy. Bring these type of movies back man. I‚Äôm excited for this
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,The cast for this movie is fantastic
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"I still think the original two films from the early 2000s are highly underrated, but I‚Äôll definitely give this a watch/chance."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-02,Im surprised in 2023 its not called The BoogeyThey
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-20,Horror movies haven&#39;t been horroring and not so scary to me these past few years but this trailer FOR SURE caught my attention and looks like a must watch!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-06,"This movie was pretty good, 7.5/10 in my opinion. It was so emotional, very sad with what the main family is going through. I really feel bad for the older daughter. The acting is really good. And the movie had awesome editing. The camera movement in some of the scenes where it was upside down first then the camera moved, was epic!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"Perfect trailer! Holy moly...that first <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFqCmIU0-_M&amp;t=80"">1:20</a> is sublime!! Love that bass-y warping sound along with the cello (violin?)üòÆ"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2024-04-06,This short story scared me so bad as a kid. It led me down the path of reading everything scary because I wanted to face my nightmares. I owe Mr. King an enormous debt in that respect.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,"I loved the Stephen King short story when I read it ages ago. This is another case of merely using the story as a jumping off point for a different storyline altogether, though it remains to be seen if they keep the original ending, and I suspect they may have. That being said, this does look good."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,"Don&#39;t worry, you must call John Wick."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,&quot;He was the one you sent to kill f-ing Boogeyman.&quot; So glad to see John Wick in this movie. I&#39;m excited
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-11,This film brings into light the fear you have as a child that there‚Äôs something lurking in the dark
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,I love the &quot;19&quot; on the house number for a movie based on a Stephen King story. :)
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,Never watched Boogeyman (2005) but I love Boogeyman 2 (2008). This looks great definitely seeing more jump scares in this version.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-21,Still looks better than Halloween ends
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,"This trailer will most definitely be better than the movie,because it is a masterpiece in of itself."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,This is going to be such a great year for horror films!!!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-20,"Just when I‚Äôve given up on horror films for good. This comes along. Guess it took really great production work, cast and producers to finally make one. I haven‚Äôt flinched in so long lol I got goosebumps from this. Can‚Äôt wait till it hits the screens!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-31,Having boogeyman problems? Call your nearest John Wick to keep the boogeyman away!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,"I&#39;m a purist, so the first thing that I noticed is that it&#39;s obviously a lot different from the original short story that it&#39;s based on. That, however, isn&#39;t always a bad thing. Even I can admit that. <br>Can&#39;t wait to see what the Boogeyman looks like. For some reason as a kid I always imagined that it&#39;d look like Venom from the Spidey comics..."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-07,"This is not what I envisioned as a child as the boogeyman, I‚Äôd been terrified too üòÇ"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,"the monster under your bed isn&#39;t a tale, it&#39;s a nightmare."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2024-05-22,"&quot;So, every Halloween night, lock your doors, turn off your lights, and pray you&#39;ll make it to morning, because the Boogeyman is real, and his name is Michael Myers.&quot;"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-11,This is the first horror movie that actually looks scary to me
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-09-03,The 2023 horror movies  give us the 2000s horror movies VIBES ‚ù§
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,"After the &quot;baba yaga&quot; jokes in Ant Man, David Dastmalchian being in this is fascinating AF."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-09-03,It‚Äôs always those scary looking houses with neighbors that hears nothing üò´
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-24,"Just saw it.  Enjoyable and I liked how it didn‚Äôt rely on gore.  Apparently, a solid, real creature in the movie and not something imagined or intangible.  And the ending was fairly(though not COMPLETELY) satisfying."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-28,props to the kids that are acting in horror movies :) I think it&#39;s pretty tough for them and for the producers to make sure they won&#39;t be traumatized
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-24,This is just perfect I&#39;ve seen all of Vivian&#39;s movies and she deserves a LOT more roles
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-01,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFqCmIU0-_M&amp;t=98"">1:38</a> my mom when I shut the door a lil too hard"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-10-29,the worst part is that parents still won&#39;t listen
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-07-09,The mind of Stephen King always never make me disappointed at allüëèüëå
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"On behalf of the fans of the world film industry, I wish the film successüéâüéâüéâ"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-03,"&quot;It&#39;s the thing that comes for your kids when you&#39;re not paying attention.&quot;<br>Oh my god, it&#39;s the Child Protective Services!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,Can&#39;t Wait To See John Wick&#39;s Cameo In This Movie
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-17,I have not seen a really good scary movie in a while. I‚Äôm ready for this one!! ü§ó
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-08-04,Litrelly fell asleep during half of this movie in the cinemas and i NEVER fall asleep at the cinemas
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-24,We really need more horror movies in 2023üòç
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-05-18,It&#39;s great to have the REAL Stephen King back!!!. He&#39;s best when he writes horror and not that non scary stuff!!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,Can&#39;t wait to watch this! Both this adaptation of the story and the upcoming new version of the film are causing me a huge buzz!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-07-19,"Remember those names  Scott Beck &amp; Bryan Woods, writers of &#39;A Quiet Place&#39;. then u know you&#39;re in for a ride"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-03,Everyone go watch the movie üçø <br>It‚Äôs really good you get hooked from the beginning
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-17,The boogeyman is actually pretty good it just works for what it is. The design of the creature/shadow monster was done very well. I like the fact that they don&#39;t show it right away just in quick cuts here and there. Which works
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,If John Wick doesn&#39;t come in the end and kill the fuckinn boogeyman. I am giving this movie 0 stars.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2024-03-02,"Saw this with my 2 cousins , brother , &amp; 2 step brothers.. &amp; we ALL absolutely loved it!"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,This trailer looks awesome. Hope the movie lives up to this. Genuinely curious
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,"Based on a book by Stephen King with key words: Boogeyman, Producer of Stranger Things, someone getting kicked the face by the boogeyman, and John Wick Origins. This is going to be good."
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-10-06,Oh my goodness. I just watched this. I have never seen a horror film this incredible. I mean. WOW. I had to actually take breaks. PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS <b>MASTERPIECE!</b> whewww. BLOWN AWAY. The message is really something as well.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-10-16,one of the best thriler ive seen for years now. Combination of thriller and drama together!!!
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-18,You can&#39;t say John Wick&#39;s name in vain.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-09-03,I just watched this a minute ago. This truly is one of the scariest films I have ever watched and I have seen so many horror films I don&#39;t scare easily. <br>I was on edge throughout the whole film.<br>Great acting too.<br>10/10
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,"The real horror starts when this &quot;boogeyman‚Äù sees a man of focus, commitment, and sheer will coming for it üò≥"
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-17,At first i was like why is everybody mentioning John wick. Then I was like oh yeah baba yaga ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£<br><br> people are silly.<br><br> I love it.
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-06-10,I have to sit by my self for this movie tonight and the rest of my family is sitting behind me :(
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-04-19,This could either be a uniquely different horror or an  generic cliche jumpscare horror. Can&#39;t tell but I&#39;m excited and hope it&#39;s great
The Boogeyman,cFqCmIU0-_M,2023-08-09,If you‚Äôre gonna take it out the theaters at least put it out for main stream  üòí now I have to wait like another month to watch it
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,It&#39;s heartening to see that Michelle Yeoh is finally getting the recognition she deserves and getting offered more diverse roles than the usual Asian archetypes.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-09,I know these movies usually aren‚Äôt hugely successful at the box office so I‚Äôm very appreciative they keep making them. They have been well made and fun to watch.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"It probably won&#39;t be a full on horror movie, but the mere presence of those semi-horror elements makes this one of the most unusual but also interesting ideas I&#39;ve seen this year. I&#39;m curious how well it&#39;ll do after release."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-11-07,"The first two movies were superb but this, this was something else. The cinematography, the performance of Poirot, everything. It is one of the most unique and creative Agatha Christie adaptations I&#39;ve ever seen. Please do not stop making them, I&#39;ll watch each and every one."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-25,I hope they don‚Äôt stop making these movies. I‚Äôll watch every single one of them.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,I love that we have these detective films with Branagh‚Äôs Poirot and Craig‚Äôs Blanc. Now all we need is Downey‚Äôs Holmes to make a comeback. It‚Äôs a nice genre of film that is a breath of fresh air
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,Tina Fey in a drama?! And she looks amazing. Can‚Äôt wait for this. It goes without saying that Michelle Yeoh will be brilliant.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,"Now THIS is how you make a sequel. Throw the characters into a different genre, and watch it unfold. This looks like it&#39;s going to be better than the last two movies. Very few movies are afraid to switch genres, especially with the third movie in the series. For that reason alone, I hope that this is a great success. It&#39;s great when movies try something different."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-30,"this might be the one with the quality they wanted to achieve since the first one‚Ä¶a unique take on a poirot story, well done Kenneth, love that that man doesn‚Äôt give up"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-04,I‚Äôm simply going to see this just because Tina Fey is in this! Love Her! The entire cast is amazing but I love her and to see her take on a role like this excites me. She looks amazing!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,Hercule Poirot is BACK!!!! And nothing can stop him!!!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-01,Bruh they need to market this movie better. The only reason I knew it existed was because I saw a poster of it on my at out of the theater.  I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed it was a sequel if I hadn‚Äôt seen his distance appearance either.  I‚Äôm excited as hell for this movie though
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,SO EXCITIED FOR THIS! Mystery/Crime/Horror is such a rare genre in films! Will definitely watch this in cinemas!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-14,So very excited for this! I hope they make 10 Poirot movies. They are true cinematic masterpieces!! I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not more popular!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-17,That little boy in this movie deserves an Oscar for supporting actor . He acted so wellüëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"It overflows with quality, as always the cinematography, the actors, the costumes, the music, Poirot&#39;s accent... I can&#39;t wait to see it. Kenneth Branagh is synonymous with skill and talent üôåüôå"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"This looks SO GOOD! Excellent cast, beautiful cinematography, loving the direction Branagh is taking with this one."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,This is definitely different then each of the previous films. But I can‚Äôt wait to see Hercule solve this one.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-11-04,"Loved loved loved the movie! Murder mysteries are always a win for me. Also, you can never go wrong with an Agatha Cristie novel adaptation. Perfect watch for Halloween! The casting was great paired with eerie atmosphere and throbbing suspense. Don&#39;t mind the critic and go watch the movie already."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-17,"LOVED this movie. I dont usually do jump scares,but it asded to the excitement. Kenneth is a genius with these 3 movies, I hope this isn&#39;t the end. Highlight for me Jamie Dornan and Jude Hill coming together again with their natural father/son bond after Belfast."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-26,"I LOVE that they&#39;re taking a different spin on this third one. the cinematography looks stunning. and for someone who&#39;s usually too scared to watch actual horror movies, this one looks just palatable enough for me to handle. can&#39;t wait."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-27,This 2nd Trailer makes the movie look even better than the first! AND it&#39;s being released on Agatha Christie&#39;s Birthday - September 15th!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"If Michelle Yeoh is in it, it&#39;s automatically the best movie of the year"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2024-02-11,Kenneth Branagh&#39;s cinematography is top notch. I watched every single film of his literally thrice.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-14,"I watched this movie  yesterday in Paris. For me is the best of the trilogy. Lovely photography. Venice was so beautiful on screen. The best performances were Kenneth and Michell, and also the boy reading EAP. This is about to be my favorite Halloween movie for a while. Congratulations to Kenneth Branagh and to this team of actors üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,Another Agatha Christie&#39;s novel movie &amp; Kenneth Branagh&#39;s comeback role. I can&#39;t wait to watch this movie soon!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-28,"Now this is unique and original. I love when a story has a genre switch. The first 2 movies were good, but this one looks amazing."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,I admire the new direction this franchise is taking. A whodunnit/horror movie is such a good combination of genres. Here is hoping that the movie hold up to the hype that this trailer created!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-17,Saw this today. Can confirm it was excellent. The best of the three Brannaugh films for Poirot!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-09,Yes! Another Agatha Christie movie with Hercule Poirot and another fantastic cast. Can‚Äôt wait to see it. ‚ù§
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,I can‚Äôt wait to see how Poirot debunks this seemingly supernatural dilemma!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"Hercule is up for a new challenge that will test his resolve, beliefs, and sanity. However, he has one thing going for him. Only the living would kill someone to cover something up."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,We are so used to hercule in situations where everything is objective and grounded. But now he is faced with having to deal with things that could be supernatural or not. I honestly think its a good idea. It puts him in unfamiliar territory
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2025-04-19,I hope they never stop making these types of films!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2025-02-21,"I hope Branagh gets to make more of these adaptations, I&#39;ve been enjoying them and it&#39;s a great way to introduce my friends to Poirot"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,"Obviously, David Souchet will always be the Hercule Poirot. <br><br>However, what Kenneth Brannagh is bringing to the cinematic with Poirot is truly wonderful, and I hope this is a universe that brings many more stories to the big screen cause I am all for it üòä"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-28,"This is probably one of the best trailers releases recently. The cast, setup, lighting, music everything is so amazing. Waiting.. Waiting..!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-25,"Tina Fey screaming in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEddsSwweyE&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> this is really different from all her works and I love that for her."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2024-01-02,"I didnt think Agatha Christie could get better than the two other stories I know and love. Nor the movies, but this??? I LOVE gothic fiction. Especially psychological horror and ghosts. THE SETTING AND CAST IS INCREDIBLE! So excited to see this, and Im ordering the book immediately!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-15,"Well, I just saw this movie yesterday. I didn&#39;t have a chance to write down my reviews. So I&#39;m doing it now while I have some time. I was about 30 of us to go and see this movie. And a theater of 60 five, so probably about a 1/2 wanted to go see this movie. My review was I enjoyed it very much as a matter of fact, I have to applaud that they got me. They set the mystery up so well that I could not figure out who the killer was and usually I can figure out who these killers are within 30 minutes of a movie by a stumped me on this one. They threw me for a loop and I didn&#39;t see it so congratulations. I hope there&#39;s another one to follow this movie. My review is I give it a 13 out of 13 skulls and say definitely check this one out."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,Tina Fey in a Poirot movie was not something I realised I needed in my life until right this minute!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,I love these movies so much. Kenneth Branagh is so great!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-20,"I genuinely believe that all Agatha Christie books should be adapted, especially the Hercule Poirot ones. This looks awesome, CANNOT WAIT!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-10-02,Saw this last night w my lady. We both loved it. Great reprise of the 40s-50s who done it
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-16,"Just watched it ..amazing plot with the little horror touch took the movie to the next level...I like how the direction and storytelling was straight, no boring, and especially sound effects was top notch..a satisfying, thrilling horror movie to watch . And of course Sir Kenneth Branagh üëèüèΩa brilliant piece of acting from him ...."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,Finally looks like we are getting a proper Halloween this year with all these movies.

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-18,This movie is definitely one of the most underated movies I have ever watched! ait deserves more recognition.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-17,"Just saw it‚Ä¶FANTASTIC FILM! It is definitely my favorite of the three that Branagh has done and I loved the first two as well, but this one takes the cake!  Most likely will go see it again before it leaves theatres - can‚Äôt wait to see which one he does next!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-17,I cannot express how much I love Branagh‚Äôs work. I cannot wait!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-10-08,"After coming back from seeing this movie, the trailer sure was cleverly edited as to not spoil anything."

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-17,"First time I went for a movie without being planned.. Don‚Äôt know the name of any character. But it‚Äôs just a mind blowing movie. I enjoyed a lot‚Ä¶.Story screen play acting superb.. moreover it‚Äôs a must watch movie who are interested in crime,thriller,suspense‚Ä¶"

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-16,Absolutely loved this movie. Watched it last night and the cinematography and manipulation of sound is sublime. This is the best of the three and Branagh‚Äôs direction is superb. This must be seen at the cinema.

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-10-14,I always love detectives movies.. and can‚Äôt wait to see Poirot once again solving the mystery. And i think it‚Äôs more thrilling than 2 its previous movies. Keep going Poirot!

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-16,I caught a matinee of it opening night. It was a great end to the trio of modern day Hercule movies. I hope another one is made.

A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-22,YES MORE KENNETH BRANAGH AS HERCULE POIROT
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-10-31,"One of the best Poirot movies in a long,long time,i was positively shocked!!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-25,Love it. I hope they never stop making these.
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-14,"Just watched. Not what I expected. I thought I was watching a horror movie but it is 95% whodunnit and a little bit of horror. Still, it&#39;s quite enjoyable. Well worth the trip to the cinema"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-07-19,"It has Michelle Yeoh, I‚Äôm in."
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2024-04-20,been watching Poirot all my life and it never get tired of it! Loved the long going series in the 90s and love these new movies too!
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-09-09,"I love Kenneth Branagh, I am definitely watching.  I like Tina Fay too!"
A Haunting in Venice,yEddsSwweyE,2023-08-07,"Looking forward to this. The second film may have not been as good as the first (and suffered form some really bad CG environments), but both films have been visually extraordinary when it comes to camera movement and shot composition (though, again, the first film moreso than the second, but it&#39;s still in there for the second). <br><br>They do an excellent job of keeping confined environments really interesting and dynamic to look at (it could have easily been restricted to more static cameras and talking heads in different hands). You can tell the DP and cameraman are having fun with these films getting to do some of those shots."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,Original Sci-fi. Finished CGI. High production value. These aren‚Äôt something you see often these days. I‚Äôm excited
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,Yo what this actually looks incredible. This is the type of thing that could make companies realize that original stories are still more than capable of turning a profit.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,People - we need this film to succeed so we can show studios that audiences love original ideas so they finally back and finance these kinds of productions again!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-01-14,I watched it tonight and I&#39;m SO PISSED I listened to the critics and didn&#39;t experience this in the theater. Best movie of 2023. We all dropped the ball on this. So beautiful
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,This feels like Blade Runner meets District 9 meets Star Wars while being its own original thing. What an amazing looking movie can‚Äôt wait to watch this
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-26,So fascinating to see glimpses of the imagery that made Rogue One so beautiful. Definitely looks like one to catch in theaters
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-02-28,"Movie of the decade, the birth of the new vfx technology. Salute to all of those people realated to this masterpiece. Thank you"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,If you want more movies like this then go see it in theatres! looking forward to an new sci-fi story from someone that has a track record of pulling it off
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,This has quickly become one of my most anticipated movies of the year. It&#39;s right up there with Oppenheimer and Dune
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"Original Sci-fi films that doesn&#39;t need to have sequels. Gareth Edwards, I love you."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-01-28,I have no words for this film. Simple astonishing. One of the greatest films I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of seeing. Not many films can truly captivate the feeling of love but this one sure did.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,This looks incredible üò≠<br>SO refreshing.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,I want this movie to succeed it looks well made and the cast is brilliant!!!!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,Regardless if this is good or not I‚Äôm just excited to see an original screenplay for once in 2023
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-02-11,"Me and the mrs had never even heard of this movie before we watched it tonight, was expecting a standard run of the mill sci-fi........ wow. Honestly one of the best movies we&#39;ve ever seen, truly astonishing piece of art. The visuals, the storyline, the audio, everything was top. Absolutely heartbreaking and beautiful story"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,This looks epic.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-13,Denzel must be proud! JDW is becoming a Sci-Fi hero. Can&#39;t wait to see him in this. He was amazing in Tenet.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-19,Greig Fraser is totally killing it. Dune Part 2 and The Creator on the same year!! I&#39;ve always admired his partnership with Gareth since Rogue One. Still the most beautifully shot Star Wars film to date in my opinion.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-12-22,"i watched this movie for the first time yesterday, i was so excited to watch it and it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve had a movie genuinely keep me entertained the whole time, in a long while. that ending man, got me teary eyed for sure, what a beautiful story man, this is how u do sci fi originals man."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-19,I love futuristic sci-fi movies that has good cinematography. Need more original sci-fi like Elysium. Would def watch this in theaters
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,"&quot;So we&#39;re the same, you&#39;re not good and I&#39;m not a person&quot; that touched me deep üò¢üò¢üò¢"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,If the budget truly was $86.1M then there&#39;s no reason for movies to cost $300M+ because this looks INSANELY good.<br><br>ETA- this was a somewhat flippant comment and it&#39;s hilarious that someone is telling me <b>actors</b> are what makes a budget balloon past $300M+ and then dismiss me as being ignorant of the moviemaking process. I&#39;m just gonna leave it at this--- I can&#39;t wait to see this movie in the theatre. Period. End of comment.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-01-03,This was a truly impressive film.  I can‚Äôt help but feel this is what the recent Star Wars films should have strived for but failed so miserably and alienated their fan base in the process.  So great to enjoy a groundbreaking SciFi movie again.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"I don‚Äôt know man this looks so good, teaser trailer already gave me chills and this made sure I‚Äôll definitely watch it in theaters"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,This is how CGI was supposed to look like in every major studios movies for the last decade. How Edwards managed to accomplish such beautiful vfx with only 20 mil budget is speaking volumes.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-20,"This looks incredible, I just got goosebumps for the first time in a long time when it comes to cinema. It looks stunning."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2025-01-20,"Every once in a while, I&#39;ll find a movie so good that I&#39;m surprised I&#39;d never heard it as an avid movies guy. This is one of them! I&#39;m going to rewatch it this weekend!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"As a aspiring filmmaker, I‚Äôve rarely been as hyped as I am for this film. The whole thing was shot on a FX3! Looks insane!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-28,Just saw it. The whole theater remained speechless and almost paralyzed after the end. Probably the best sci-fi movie I‚Äôve seen so far. Forget Star Wars. Simply amazing.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-01-08,"This is original sci fi with emotional attachment, so refreshing to see a non generic plot like star wars and so on."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,"Honestly at this point, Gareth Edwards will draw me to any movie. This looks incredible, I will definitely be seeing this in cinemas."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,From the director of rogue one and 2014&#39;s Godzilla. <br>Perfect timing this to be the first trailer from a Disney studio to come out 24 hours after the actors union goes on strike. I probably won&#39;t have time to see this (busy schedule) in theaters but I did love Gareth Edward&#39;s take on Godzilla and Star Wars.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-30,I watched it tonight and it was absolutely beautiful and even profound at times. I really hope it does well so more originals like this will be made.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2025-02-18,"A classic sci-fi with a Blade Runner + Edge of Tomorrow feel to it. Plus, who doesn&#39;t love John David Washington? Definitely watching it"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"I&#39;m definitely gonna go and see The Creator. I saw the first teaser trailer for the film advertised when I went to see Mission Impossible 7 Part 1 and it completely blew my mind. We need more original mainstream blockbuster films like this and not just Sequels, Prequels, Spin offs, Remakes, Reboots or Superhero films."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-29,I saw this film tonight and absolutely loved it. It feels like a film like The Arrival where it&#39;s sci-fi but it feels and looks realistic. It definitely borrows tropes from films like Blade Runner and Avatar . Highly recommend.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-19,"This is giving so many Last of Us/Cyberpunk/Detroit vibes and I freaking love that! Result‚Äôs gonna be a truly breathtaking cinematic experience, I can feel it!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-10-27,Hands down!! ‚Ä¶one of the best SCI-FI movies out there. Beautifully imaged detailed and great sound quality. A true masterpiece!!!üí™üí™
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,This reminds me so much of Neill Blomkamp! I&#39;m all here for it :)
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-14,"What really made this trailer stand out was the story. Plus the imagery looks fantastic. I‚Äôve seen Rogue One only once, but the story was well written. ‚ÄúThe Creator‚Äù seems to follow in the footsteps of ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù but with its own twist. I‚Äôm excited for this!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,A completely original movie made by an established director.<br>I am down for this 100%. This looks incredible.<br><br>Let&#39;s hope everyone else is so that we can keep getting more of this.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-08-12,I am adding this to my watch list. A friend of mine just recommended it to me. The trailer had me locked in! Looks good
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-28,"Just got back from watching this movie. Cinematography on point, cool story, cool act from actor/actress, it feels natural and real. Awesome."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-27,"Just saw this &amp; walked out of the theatre, never since watching T2 Judgement day have I Been this SCI-Fi happy. This will be a epic true cult classic in no time, Hans Zimmer on the score &amp; Greig Fraser‚Äôs/Oren soffer‚Äôs Cinematography with Gareth‚Äôs directing really crafted a unforgettable &amp; timely masterpiece."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-10-08,"I went on a whims and decided to watch a movie w my boyfriend. we had not planned to watch anything specific and never even heard of or seen the trailer to this movie, but we decided to watch this it and wow i was so beautiful. My favorite part of sci-fi movies are the visuals and god they did their thing with this one. Every shot in the movie was beautiful and the nature around felt surreal especially on the big screen. The story line was not as predictable and quite emotional, kept me on my toes! (I did tear up a couple times) This movie was better than what i expected it to be. 10/10 DEFINITELY RECOMMEND"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-06-19,This movie will make you wonder your humanity. It grasps to your core. This movie I would say is an absolute masterpiece.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-06,"Dystopian. Sci-fi. Action. Adventure. Philosophy. This is not just giving me a good movie, but every genre of movie I love all in one. This trailer made me read more about Gareth Edwards others movies and let me just say that my week is made..."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-21,"Finally, a refreshing sci-fi movie once in a while and with Hans Zimmer for the music as well. Getting real tired of how most movies keep doing the multiverse trend lately so this one&#39;s a breath of fresh air."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-29,Waiting for my Corridor crew fans to inform people about the stock footage from the Beirut explosion
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-04-10,There is no greater force on this Earth than a father&#39;s love for his child...
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-31,This movie is gonna be insane to see and experience on the big screen. I‚Äôm definitely gonna have a good time seeing this movie.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,This looks incredible! I always try to go out of my way to support these new projects without any established IP. Can&#39;t wait!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-11,"The fact that this was shot on Sony FX3&#39;s only, makes it 10 times better. Absolutely incredible! <br>If you&#39;re not impressed, google the camera - it&#39;s tiny compared to usually used cinema cameras."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-12-25,"This film is an original classic, up there with Bladerunner, 2001, The Thing, Aliens, Matrix etc.  Great cinema. Tragically undersold, meanwhile the major studios sink fortunes trying to keep the Marvel and DC universes up and running."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-03,"Just so everyone knows at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=25"">0:25</a> they used real footage of the 2020 Beirut explosion, of course some buildings were added and some were modified. Search it up to see a side by side comparison."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-21,Nice to see an original story coming to the big screen.  Projects fail because its rendition after rendition of stories in IPs already known.  Exploration and experimenting is what makes theatres great again.  VERY excited for this
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-20,"Rogue One is arguably my favorite Star Wars film. So, knowing that the director behind it is involved with this film, I&#39;m pretty excited to see it."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-12-24,"This movie dazzled me and ripped my heart out at the same time. I&#39;m a lifelong Syfy fan, but this was so much more. It was a truly good film.  I&#39;m not one to cry but was fighting back tears."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"Can&#39;t wait for this movie, Dune and Rebel Moon. The three biggest Sci-Fi epics of this year üî•"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,I especially love the tech design and the story elements sound like a rock solid near future plot... An absolute must-see for me...
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,Hands down to one of the best cinematographer ever
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,The fact that this was shot on the Sony fx3 ($4000 camera) is insane. Shows equipment doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre amazing at what you do.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-06-09,"I remember watching this. I went on to the theatre website looking for a good movie to watch and then this was the only one that looked decent, so i booked a ticket. I am SO HAPPY that I did that. This was absolutely AMAZING .<br><br>P.S if you haven&#39;t watched it yet, IT&#39;S NOT TOO LATE"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,I&#39;m happy and excited this is coming to theaters and not direct to streaming. This looks epic.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-07,Ok but are we going to talk about how they used real footage of a real tragedy just so that their trailer looks good?
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,Let&#39;s go! One of my favourite directors is back! Definitely watching this film multiple times.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-03-17,"It was amazing and heartwarming. One of the best sci-fi films of all time after ET. It definitely should have been nominated for Best Picture at the 2024 Oscars and Madeleine Yuna Voyles should have been nominated for Best Actress because she was emotional, cute and amazing."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,"This has promise! Everything from this trailer looks great, from the visuals to story. I really hope it delivers. Marking it on my calendar, because original projects like these really should be supported at the box office.<br>Also really dig the robot designs. Something about humanoid robots with funny heads wearing clothes just jives with me. Love it."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"Love it! Cool story, excellent cast, stunning visuals and good action. Gareth Edwards never disappoints! AND NOT A PREQUEL, SEQUEL, REQUEL, REBOOT of a known IP! Extra Points for that!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-12,"Don‚Äôt think anyone realizes that we have this movie, Napoleon, AND Dune part 2 all coming out around the same time! What a time to be alive!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2025-03-17,My headcanon is this takes place in the same universe as Cyberpunk 2077.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-19,"Whoever is the designer for the Weapons Costumes and so on will win an award.100 % sure. Every little  second this Trailer looks awesome. Overall Picture with the choose of colours, Lense choice, Perspective, light, Cut, every second is awesome."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-29,"Man, saw this movie today and I cant shake this feeling off that you get after watching a good movie. Such an underrated movie that people are not giving this a chance. I&#39;m in love with the story telling. Still thinking bout this movie&#39;s ending even now."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-20,I always wanted someone to make a trailer-style remaster of Dream On. I just wish these studios would release them on separate tracks so we could listen to them cause it‚Äôs a bop
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-01-24,"What an amazing movie! I&#39;ve been somewhat reluctant to watch it, because we see too many scifi movies that turns out to be bad movies lately, but this takes the cake! If I was afraid to waste my time and almost not going to watch it, I&#39;m pretty sure other people have not watched it yet and don&#39;t know what they are missing. I absolutely loved the movie! I am very hard to please, but this was a master piece!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-23,This is magnificent. This is incredible. This is original and yet seems something that we have seen and was lost during all these years. This is something we crave . This is cinema. This is what exactly we go to cinemas. People please go and watch this in theatres. Make it a hit. We deserve good movies and good movies deserve the due recognition from us.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"Great trailer, great choice of music. Looks like a movie worth watching at the cinema. I&#39;ll be watching this at IMAX."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-29,it&#39;s cool you felt it ok to use actual explosion footage from beruit for your vfx. nice ethics on that one
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-02-19,Amazing..made me cry a little. Wondeerful job !!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-28,This movie is incredible. It contributes something new to the Science Fiction genre as well as the world of robotics and AI. This film creates a new ethical standpoint on how we view machines and how they view us. Superb.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-26,"I love how this isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúAI bad, human good‚Äù. It tells how AI aren‚Äôt really that different from humans, up to a certain point. It‚Äôs like 2 nations at war, thinking the other is evil, but they just have different interests, and neither is bad."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,This honestly looks like an instant sci-fi classic! I am so excited that this is an ORIGINAL film and not an already existing idea or brand! I&#39;m in that theater on day one!!!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-04-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=28"">0:28</a> THE JET SCENE THO MAN THAT LOOKS AMAZING"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-18,Trailer tugged at my heart strings.<br><br>Production &amp; story looks amazing. Better than any other trailer I seen in a minute.<br><br>I shall be watching this upon release
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-22,100% going to watch this as soon as it hits the big screen. Looks incredible!
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"As a student going to pursue a career in computer studies, this is absolutely a must watch."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-12-25,This was a good movie. It made you think what if our creations surpassed us with there ability to love and have compassion for others in need.
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,"this kid is killing it in this trailer, so many emotions"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-29,"Felt so real, so real that they even use the footage from Beirut explosion <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=24"">0:24</a>. I mean man, tf are you doing?"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-18,"As a big fan of Gareth Edwards&#39; feature film debut, &quot;Monsters,&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed his rendition of &quot;Godzilla&quot; and most of &quot;Rogue One&quot;! He&#39;s also a visual effects artist and I feel like it shows in how he directs VFX-heavy sequences. I read that the on-location filming for this one had a very indie approach (like &quot;Monsters&quot;), so I&#39;m really looking forward to what Edwards and team will show us this time around ‚Äì¬†I just wish it had a less generic title. üòÜ"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-05-11,This movie was awesome and I appreciate the effort for an original movie like this to get made. This trailer with the music is probably the best trailer is the last 5 or so yrs
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-22,This actually looks so good. Refreshing to see something else in cinema
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-09-19,"I just read about the production of this movie and it blew me away and made me want to watch the movie in theatre. This movie is an old school filmmaking: using panavision anamorphic lens,  guerilla style shooting in real locations across the globe, indie style filmmaking twist with the use of sony mirrorless (FX3) as it&#39;s primary camera. <br><br>The creative team and work behind this movie gives me hope of a great film."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-03,The trailer needs 9/11 footage to go with the Beirut explosion one
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-12-29,"i regretted of not seeing this movie on the big screen! i didn&#39;t know this so well made, the scale of tech, robot AI and the explosion feel so real"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-03,"Did you know that the explosion used <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3C1-5Dhb8&amp;t=24"">0:24</a>  is taken from the beirut blast that happend on August 4 2020"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-31,"I believe this will be beautiful.  The tone, the depth...all seem fantastic.  Also, I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be consumed with sadness at the end."
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-08-24,"The CGI, VFX and everything looks crazy good!"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2024-09-29,"totally underated movie, this is a jewel that sadly went off the radar"
The Creator,ex3C1-5Dhb8,2023-07-17,been waiting for this since the first trailer. Kawhi Leonard is a good actor
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,I feel like any actor would be honored to be in a ghibli film
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-09,This movie is absolutely insane. Its like a combination of every Ghibli film and yet feels completely different
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-20,"I&#39;m a Japanese woman in my 40s living in Spain, and I just saw this movie last weekend. It was the first time that I could not stop crying after watching a movie, not just Ghibli movies, but all movies. It was a movie that deeply moved my heart. This is a masterpiece created by Hayao Miyazaki, who is 82 years old and is the same age as my father, with all his soul.<br> It contains a message for humanity. As you can see from the Japanese title, &quot;How do you guys live?&quot;, Hayao Miyazaki is asking, &quot;This is how I lived my life. How do you guys live your lives?&quot; <br><br>A number of prominent Japanese animation studios collaborated in the production of this work. It&#39;s a kind of repayment that shows respect and awe for what the 82-year-old Hayao Miyazaki has given us. <br>I don&#39;t know why I burst into tears after watching the movie, but I feel like it was out of respect for him and gratitude, saying, &quot;Thank you for showing me so many great movies since my childhood.&quot;<br><br>Unfortunately, this movie did not do well at the box office in Japan. It&#39;s a shame that people in Japan seem to be asking too much for ``correct answers&#39;&#39; from movies. For me, the correct interpretation is that this movie is &quot;art.&quot; What is important is what the viewer feels.<br><br>I&#39;m really happy that it&#39;s been highly rated overseas. The Academy Awards will be announced in January. The Academy Awards have fallen into commercialism, but could you please move those excectives of Hallywood who respect Hayao Miyazaki to action? <br><br>The last Academy Award for Hayao Miyazaki!!!!<br>------------------------------------------------<br>11/03/2024 <br>About 30 minutes ago, the winner of the 2024 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film was announced! Congratulations to Hayao Miyazaki!<br>After watching the Golden Globe Awards, British Academy Awards, and award trends in the past few months, and watching the several-minute video message from producer Suzuki and director Hayao Miyazaki that appeared on the Oscar website a few days ago, I was actually convinced that he would win the Academy Award. I sincerely respect and appreciate the efforts of 83-year-old my„ÄÄgrandfather! I&#39;m really happy! !"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"It has already been released in Spain, and I can tell you that you are not prepared for this masterpiece. It deserves to be seen in a movie theater"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,Rob Pattinson&#39;s voice acting is incredible. The direction for the english cast in Ghibli movies are always stellar.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-11,„Ç¢„Ç´„Éá„Éü„ÉºË≥ûÂèóË≥û„Åä„ÇÅ„Åß„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ<br><br>Êò†Áîª„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´Âê∏„ÅÑËæº„Åæ„Çå„Åù„ÅÜ„Å´„Å™„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™È≠ÖÂäõÁöÑ„Å™Êò†Áîª„Åß„Åó„Åü..!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"Just in the trailer alone you can see shades of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Totoro, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. It truly feels like this is the culmination of Miyazaki&#39;s life&#39;s work, and hopefully will be the shining masterpiece it seems."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,"This is IMO the most ambitious, and best, movie Hayao Miyazaki has made since Spirited Away. No one does it quite like him. It&#39;s just pure, cinematic magic that transports you to another world."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-19,"I absolutely love that Studio Ghibli is still doing Cel Animation for their movies, it makes it feel so organic and nostalgic."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-08,"I have to remind myself of how grateful I am to see hayao miazaki films in theaters. He truly is of the last masters of his form. I will never gain the experience nor the understanding of why his films just have this sort of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù factor to them, but I am 100% certain that it‚Äôs there. That there is a sort of magic in his films that I can feel. Thank god that I got to live in the same time as the great hayao miazaki. It has a been a true honor to not have watched his films but to have experienced them. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie in theaters. To see it anywhere but on the biggest screen possible would be (to myself) a sin to the love of movies. People sometimes ask about certain pieces of art and say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make like they use too‚Äù or something along those lines, but I want you to know that this movie is one of those movies. There will never be a movie like the boy and the heron. It truly is the last movie of a bygone era of animated movies where animation had this much care and attention to the world itself. You will find movies that will imitate and maybe be inspired by its style but never find another that is THIS AUTHENTIC to its source. If I haven‚Äôt made it clear enough, I really do urge people to see this movie. <br><br>Edit:<br>Just saw the movie and I can confidently say that hayao miazaki still that greatness and that magic that‚Äôs in all of his movies. It was definitely his most personal and his most complex movie to date. It‚Äôs one of those movies that‚Äôs not easily digestible and may take 2 or more viewings to truly gain an understanding of what you saw. I‚Äôm going to see it again and try to see if I can get a better understanding of it entire. Also in every studio ghibli movie there is always that one moment where I‚Äôm watching it and i just look upon in wonder and awe and say ‚Äúwow‚Äù. This movie has those moments. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I said those words in a theater before. I know it kind of cliche to say this but DAMN IS THIS MOVIE BEAUTIFUL."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,Pattinson as the Heron is ridiculous in all the best ways
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-10,Just saw this film. Was completely unprepared. The only way I can think to describe it is &quot;like a beautiful nightmare.&quot; One of the most deeply upsetting and deeply moving films I&#39;ve seen.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-04,The pure joy and warmth I get out of watching any Ghibli movie is undescribable. My fiance and I have watched the movies over a dozen times but we won&#39;t get tired. Thank you mother for showing me Kiki and Totoro at a young age. Your love sparks with every Ghibli scene. And thank you everyone at Studio Ghibli. You can&#39;t imagine the importance of your movies for my health.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,The way a ghibli film will give me goosebumps every time is uncanny.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-08,"We‚Äôve just gotten home from watching this movie, what an absolute mind-blow. Incredibly beautiful and full of heart. Please go see this masterpiece for yourself."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,The amount of people who think the heron is willem or mark is hilarious. Robert is just that good at transforming his voice apparently
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"the animation is so damn clean, especially the fire scenes, words just cant express its pure beauty!!"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-11-02,"I am 60 years old. I saw a Ghibli movie for the first time when I was 20 years old. I am surprised that even at my age, I can be moved by a so-called animated movie.<br><br>I wanted to show my children the things I love, so when they were small, I bought the DVDs and sat in front of the TV with them many times.<br><br>Now that my son is an adult, he shows Ghibli movies to his children, that is, my grandchildren. Rather than showing them, he watches them with them. My grandchildren are still in kindergarten, so last month it was &quot;Totoro&quot; and this month it was &quot;Ponyo.&quot; When a Ghibli movie is on TV, I can&#39;t help but be glued to the screen and watch it with them, which is funny. Even though I&#39;ve seen the scenes many times, I can&#39;t help but be drawn in, laughing, feeling excited, and feeling sad.<br><br>My granddaughters will grow up someday and be old enough to watch &quot;How Do You Live?&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies.&quot; The sad scenes may make their hearts burst.<br><br>The reason why Ghibli films have a nostalgic sensibility and attract so many people is probably because they carefully portray primal human emotions and human warmth through intricate depictions.<br><br>ÁßÅ„ÅØ60Ê≠≥„Åß„Åô„ÄÇÂàù„ÇÅ„Å¶„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„ÇíË¶ã„Åü„ÅÆ„ÅØ20Ê≠≥„ÅÆÈ†É„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Åì„ÅÆÂπ¥„Å´„Å™„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„Çè„ÇÜ„Çã„Ç¢„Éã„É°Êò†Áîª„ÅßÊÑüÂãï„Åß„Åç„Çã„Å®„ÅØÈ©ö„Åç„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br><br>Ëá™ÂàÜ„ÅåÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Å™„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅØÂ≠ê‰æõÈÅî„Å´„ÇÇË¶ã„Åõ„Åü„ÅÑ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂ≠ê‰æõÈÅî„ÅåÂ∞è„Åï„ÅÑ„Å®„Åç„ÅØDVD„ÇíË≤∑„ÅÑ„ÄÅ‰ΩïÂ∫¶„ÇÇ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„ÅÆÂâç„Å´Â∫ß„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ<br><br>‰ªä„Åß„ÅØÂ§ß‰∫∫„Å´„Å™„Å£„ÅüÊÅØÂ≠ê„Åå„ÇÑ„ÅØ„Çä„Åù„ÅÆÂ≠ê‰æõ„ÄÅ„Å§„Åæ„Çä„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÅÆÂ≠´ÈÅî„Å´„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„ÇíË¶ã„Åõ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇË¶ã„Åõ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Çà„Çä‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´Ë¶ã„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åæ„Å†„ÄÅÂ≠´„ÅØÂπºÁ®öÂúíÂÖê„Å™„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂÖàÊúà„ÅØ„Äå„Éà„Éà„É≠„Äç„ÄÅ‰ªäÊúà„ÅØ„Äå„Éù„Éã„Éß„Äç„Åß„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅ„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Å´„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„Åå„ÅÜ„Å§„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„Å§„ÅÑÁßÅ„Åæ„Åß„Åù„ÅÆÁîªÈù¢„Å´„Åè„Åé‰ªò„Åë„Å´„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´Ë¶ãÂÖ•„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åã„Çâ„Åä„Åã„Åó„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ‰ΩïÂõû„ÇÇË¶ã„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÂ†¥Èù¢„Å™„ÅÆ„Å´„ÄÅ„Å§„ÅÑÂºï„ÅçËæº„Åæ„Çå„Å¶„ÄÅÁ¨ë„Å£„Åü„Çä„ÄÅ„Å©„Åç„Å©„Åç„Åó„Åü„Çä„ÄÅÊÇ≤„Åó„Åè„Å™„Å£„Åü„Çä„Åó„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br><br>„Åì„ÅÆÂ≠´Â®òÈÅî„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„Å§„ÅãÂ§ß„Åç„Åè„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ„ÄåÂêõ„Åü„Å°„ÅØ„Å©„ÅÜÁîü„Åç„Çã„Åã„Äç„ÇÑ„ÄåÁÅ´ÂûÇ„Çã„ÅÆÂ¢ì„Äç„ÇíË¶ã„Çå„ÇãÂπ¥ÈΩ¢„Å´„Å™„Çã„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„ÄÇÊÇ≤„Åó„ÅÑÂ†¥Èù¢„Åß„ÅØËÉ∏„ÅåÂºµ„ÇäË£Ç„Åë„Åù„ÅÜ„Å´„Å´„Å™„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇ<br><br>„Åù„Çì„Å™„Ç∏„Éñ„É™Êò†Áîª„Åå„Å™„Çì„Å†„ÅãÊáê„Åã„Åó„Åè„ÄÅ„Åù„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅÂ§ö„Åè„ÅÆ‰∫∫„ÇíÂºï„Åç‰ªò„Åë„Çã„ÅÆ„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰∫∫Èñì„Å®„Åó„Å¶„ÅÆÂéüÂàù„ÅÆÊÑüÊÉÖ„ÄÅ‰∫∫Èñì„ÅÆÊ∏©„Åã„Åï„ÇíÁ¥∞„ÇÑ„Åã„Å™ÊèèÂÜô„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´‰∏ÅÂØß„Å´Êò†„ÅóÂá∫„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åã„Çâ„Åß„ÅØ„Å™„ÅÑ„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åã„ÄÇ"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-07,"Saw this today in Belgium, it&#39;s a masterpiece. It feels like a &quot;conclusion&quot; of sorts to both Spirited Away and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. You are not prepared how strange, creepy and beautiful this story is."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,"All of Miyazaki&#39;s movies make me cry. They are just too damn beautiful. From Nausica, to this, I am never not amazed. I am so excited to watch this, and just grateful we all get another movie out of him."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-13,I lived in Japan from 1985 to 1988. Near my apartment there was a movie theatre that specialized in Anime films. I got to see Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind at that theatre. I fell in love with his films from that point on. I have enjoyed watching many Japanese anime films (the TV anime is spotty on the quality) but there is something about Miyazaki Hayao&#39;s work that never fails to touch my soul. I learn something about life and myself every time I see one of his films. I was a young man when I saw that first film and now I&#39;m 60. Unbelievable how fast time has passed. Just glad I&#39;m still here to see one more of his movies.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,I never thought I&#39;d see another Miyazaki film released in my lifetime. I&#39;m so exited to see this one! legit brought me to tears.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,Robert Pattinson as the Heron is unrecognizable!!! I can&#39;t wait to watch this
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-11,"Absolutely loved this masterpiece. Mahito&#39;s coming of age journey, his love for his mother and Natsuko, the wisdom of the grand uncle, how the film is left open to various interpretations, the homage to previous Ghibli films, and of course, the stunning animation."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,Anyone else finding it very strange how we can‚Äôt tell that that‚Äôs Robert Pattinson voicing the Heron? You‚Äôd imagine Williem Dafoe or Mark Hamil were the ones voicing him. Very good voice acting range from Pattinson there.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-08,&quot;You see this world....there&#39;s more work to be done&quot;. I was already getting goosebumps due to the animation and editing. This line just brought everything to a climax
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-19,"I&#39;ve rewatched this movie three times now in both subbed and dub. I really wanted to click with it on my first watch, but left the theater like a lot of people here, feeling a mixture of a bit of boredom, confusion, lost, disappointment, and ambiguity. It was kind of hard for me to accept tbh. But, like The Wind Rises, I was lost while watching, but started to really appreciate it more as I pondered and solved certain aspects of the film. I gave it two more watches with other family members, and each time, I caught on to more of the symbolism, and probably most importantly, I had a new perspective on the pacing and plot. By the third watch, I was able to just sit back and enjoy every moment, and it&#39;s now competing for my favorite Ghibli film. It&#39;s Miyazaki&#39;s most introspective film by far, and combines the mature and mellow tones of something like The Wind Rises with the childhood adventure of his earliest works.<br><br>I think the biggest killer of this movie for many fans will be expectations, followed by familiarity with Miyazaki. Based on the English trailer and name I saw, I was expecting a fast and simple adventure. It&#39;s not that. This film is slow paced, meticulous, and leaves a lot unexplained. The first half of the movie is essentiall all build up. We&#39;ve also all gotten used to movies explaining each and every little thing to us and following a formulaic plot format that we all know. Miyazaki doesn&#39;t do that here at all. Characters don&#39;t explain their actions to anyone. He gives you clues to most of the puzzles but leaves it unsolved for the audience. Also, there is no static quest or objective for most of the movie. Just like life, Mahito&#39;s position and goal are always moving. Some might also feel like the transitions are rushed, but they are best described as fluid. Scenes move from one to another in a way not typical of most films. Lastly, the more familiar you are with where Miyazaki is as a creator, the more you can understand the themes. This movie is a farewell letter to his family, friends, coworkers, and fans more than anything else as he prepares us to watch his work disappear when he dies.<br><br>There are also some cultural stuff not explained. For instance, it is taboo for men to enter a woman&#39;s birthing room, especially in 1940s Japanese culture."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,Only a ghibli trailer could have me tearing up even when I&#39;ve just got a vague idea of what the movie will be about üíïü•∫
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-16,"The trailer alone made me shed a tear; the voice acting is impactful as well, just pure emotion put into it"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-08,I saw the film on IMAX in LA with the original Japanese voice track with subtitles and I was blown away.  I can&#39;t begin to express the depth of this film.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-10,"Wow, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve gotten goosebumps from a preview like this. I&#39;m glad every time Miyazaki-san comes out of retirement to make &quot;just one more movie&quot; because it&#39;s such a treat to live in his worlds. ü•∞"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"They weren&#39;t lying. After watching it two times, even though I still think Spirited away and Princess mononoke are masterpieces, this movie feels like his Magnum Opus."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-09,"I just watched this in theaters, it was the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, it spoke to my soul and changed how I viewed life as a whole."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"What a stacked cast. And wow, that animation is clean as hell, can definitely see why it took six years to make this film. Great job everyone, can&#39;t wait to see this."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"This is a pretty interesting trailer. The characters look interesting, the animation is incredible, and voice cast is stacked. But I can‚Äôt believe Miyazaki is back directing his 12th feature film at the age of 83. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. In terms of animated films, did he directed more movies than other animators?"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-08,I‚Äôm so happy this got nominated from the Golden Globe! Truly deserves it trophy üèÜ
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,"Studio Ghibli&#39;s films have been close to my heart since I was very young. Such emotion, such comfort, such joy they have brought me. To see yet another film from the masters on the big screen, and a new story inspired by such a classic book, I can only imagine how incredible it will be in it&#39;s entirety."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"Full English stacked is just like candy, this is insane to see how some came back and do it justice every time‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-11,"Miyazaki has done it again; I have the upmost respect for this man, this legend has truly left a mark on every generation alive to witness his works."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-21,I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one that feels like this but there&#39;s something about the films made by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli that now any time I see their style of animation it instantly fills me with joy
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,"Idk what is it with Miyazki&#39;s films, but even a trailer for them makes me cry like a baby."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-12,„Å©„Çì„Å™„Å´Ë®Ä„Çè„Çå„Çà„ÅÜ„Åå‰ªä„Åæ„ÅßË¶ã„ÅüÊò†Áîª„Åß‰∏ÄÁï™Â•Ω„Åç
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,There is no mistaking this for anything other than a true Miyazaki piece. I hope it does splendidly in the USA.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,Pattinson&#39;s voice from being a Cringe Vampire to Batman to Grey Heron üò≥<br>Him and Suda Masaki impressed meü•≤
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-09,This was a good one. I was so grateful to be able to see a new Miyazaki film in theaters. Never thought that would happen.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,Can&#39;t wait to see this one. Would have never guessed that voice was Robert Pattinson either
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-04,It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôve done something I always love seeing - taking the techniques learned to animate specialized scenes and apply them moving forward. Anyone who saw Suzume knows what I mean. Regardless of director/production it‚Äôs not only smart practice but makes the entire set of movies feel cohesive stylistically!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-06,"Took my mother to see this last night. My mother is a burn survivor who got caught in a house fire a few years before I was born, and got 3rd degree burns on 99% of her body. To say this film struck a chord with me would be an understatement. After seeing this once, certainly still not my favourite Ghibli, but I don&#39;t know if I could but into words how I felt sharing this experience with my mother."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-11,"Just saw it in theaters with my bf and kid as we‚Äôre all massive ghibli fans and we had our minds blown. this movie already means a lot to me, even more so than spirited away which has been a part of my heart ever since I was a young kid."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,Robert Pattinson&#39;s voice as the Heron is so eerie i almost thought it was dubbed by Willem Dafoe.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-15,"imo, this is his top 3 film. So subtle, so many layers, so character and emotionally driven. Part coming of age, part auto biographical. It&#39;s the kind of film that stays with me for a very long time, like Satoshi Kon&#39;s films."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,Robert Pattinson may be the best voice actor of our generation.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-09,I don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s about but I&#39;m tearing up just watching the trailer. I can&#39;t wait. No one can do it quite like Ghibli.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-13,god this was absolutely incredible. i genuinely have no words. it captured the magic of all the classic ghibli movies whilst maintaining its own identity. its everything we could have ever wanted.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"I went to Japan a month ago and last thing i did was see this movie in japanese (i don&#39;t know Japanese). Even without speaking the language, the movie stunned me. I can&#39;t wait to see it again here in the States, and get the full experience this time!"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-04,"This has to be one of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen. The music, the imagery, the voice acting, it‚Äôs all so perfect. I haven‚Äôt been this excited to see a movie in years."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-10,"Watching the trailer with my partner and we fell silent and just tears. Moved because I feel the goodbye, I see the tribute, and there is more in this world to be done. Thank you Hayao."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,This feels like classic Hayao. Can‚Äôt wait to see it. Ghibli movies have a certain quiet magic and they weave a spell over the viewer than other animation can‚Äôt.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-10,i‚Äôm actually so sad that people grow old and have to leave this world‚Ä¶ miyazaki deserves the world for putting a great memory in most children‚Äôs childhood- including mine. idk what i‚Äôm gonna do now that the boy and heron is his last film üòî ghibli will always be in my heart
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-12,And this film won the Oscars last night. <br>Miyazaki is truly a legend
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-13,"I&#39;ve seen it yesterday and let me tell you, this is not just one of Miyazaki&#39;s greatest films to date, it is simply one of year&#39;s best films period. The storytelling, cinematography, pacing, all remarkable, a true work of art. I did see it in its original japanese dubbing, and that&#39;s how I recommend it to be seen."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-04,"There are a lot of references to Miyazaki&#39;s past works.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=27"">0:27</a> Mononoke<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=52"">0:52</a> Ponyo<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=60"">1:00</a> Future Boy Conan<br> <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=62"">1:02</a> Kiki&#39;s house<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=64"">1:04</a> Howl (Calcifer?)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> Whisper of the heart (possibly)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=67"">1:07</a> Animal Treasure Island (maybe)<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5khm-VjEu4&amp;t=93"">1:33</a> Laputa<br><br>The one with the boat is especially obvious."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-02-05,"I feel like Miyazaki is the only human on Earth who truly understands what animation is about. If you can do anything with animation, go fucking nuts. Show me something crazy. We need more creative people like him."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-04,"A tool to heal our collective souls - a beautiful and accurate way to describe most Miyazaki movies. He stands apart from other Japanese storytellers who are usually obsessed with tragedy and loss (something to do with the history of Japan perhaps), in that his tales almost always end with the triumph of hope and love."

The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-08,"In Italy it has been released only this week and what a masterpiece it is, it&#39;s the coronation of one of the most incredible career in the industry, it may not be the greatest Ghibli movie of them all but the fact that it is a movie both about death(the end pf a life)and about the author himself facing the end of its career deeply moves anyone who has watched it; and as obvious as it may be, I have to say it, Joes Hisaishi really outdid himself, listening to &quot;The last smile&quot; with headphones moved me to tears."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,"Ugh can&#39;t wait, my heart needs this.  So happy he made another film. I will definitely go to the theater even though it&#39;s always packed due to the lack of screenings.  It is a cool feeling being surrounded by people who collectively have so much admiration for the work."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-24,"I saw this last week. I&#39;m a 35 year old combat vet from the OIF/OEF wars. Miyazaki has always brought me some strange of peace. And I love it.  Makes me feel so normal to know someone as brilliant as he, seems to understand the brains struggle"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-09,What a gift it‚Äôs been to watch Mr.Miyazaki‚Äôs movies in my life.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-06,Studio Ghibli will always have that effect on me wherein you want to be in their world everytime you watched their movies.<br>so excited to see it back with this kind of animation ‚ù§
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-08,Just got back from this movie. I only learned of its existence last night. I didn‚Äôt see the trailer at all. I went in totally blind. It was so much fun to just watch this amazing story unfold. Can‚Äôt wait to see it again!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-12,Congrats to the team for winning best animated film of the year! Well deserved for sure
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-17,I was not sure what I saw when I left a theater but the impression it left was something I rarely felt in my life after a movie... and it comes back with the same intensity every time I think about the movie.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-18,"This film, made by an old master 82years old, is full of youthful, fresh energy, like the work by a talented young director. I went to the movie theater thinking it&#39;s must be his last fight, but within the first three minutes of the movie, I was completely knocked out and thrown over the ring. In effect, this will be Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s last work. But I can&#39;t believe he would quit making movies. I&#39;m sure he already has new ideas swirling around in his head."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2025-04-04,"the boy and the heron has a beautiful lesson <br>Instead of trying to control every aspect of our lives, we should learn to live in the moment and see the beauty that is already present around us."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-14,"I watched this masterpiece with my husband during our honeymoon at a cinema in Shinjuku without having watched the trailer and understanding only 5 words in Japanese (the movie was, of course, in the original language without any subtitle). Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s prowess in visual storytelling, combined with Joe Hisaishi&#39;s musical talents, still managed to touch and awe us. <br><br>We can&#39;t wait to watch this newest (and apparently final) work of Hayao Miyazaki when it&#39;s available in our country - with subtitles this time. :)"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"My God, Pattinson is doing actual voice acting. Didn&#39;t expect that from a celebrity."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-08,So happy to see probably Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s Last Waltz! And it was such an amazing film for his entire legacy. Hopefully he&#39;s still got room for one more as this was magically fantastic!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"Having already seen this movie in Japan, this trailer just made me hyped to see it all over again in the US!!!"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-11,The boy and the heron was the Oscar for best animated feature tonight let&#39;s gooooo
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-20,"I watched the making-of documentary of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s latest work, &quot;The Boy and the heron&quot; . After viewing the documentary, I felt that the theme of the movie is a requiem for Miyazaki&#39;s close friend, the renowned anime film director Isao Takahata, known for &quot;Grave of the Fireflies.&quot; Takahata, who was Miyazaki&#39;s senior by five years, taught many things to a young Miyazaki. For Miyazaki, Takahata was a mentor, a parent, and a rival. Takahata passed away in 2018, and Miyazaki struggled to accept his death for a long time. The boy depicted in &quot;The Boy and the heron&quot; represents Miyazaki, and the great uncle is Takahata. The farewell to the great uncle is the central theme of the film, portraying Miyazaki finally breaking free from the spell of Takahata and depicting his own liberation."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,"Could we just say it now, this will be a masterpiece. Studio Ghibli is life."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,this trailer gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes from its sheer visceral beauty. outstanding.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-10,This is the first time I&#39;ve been genuinely excited for a movie in a long time.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,seen it at a film fest a couple of weeks back and it&#39;s easily in the top 5 of Miyazaki&#39;s movies for me. Wonderful movie!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-21,To say that I‚Äôm impressed by Robert‚Äôs performance in this is a VAST understatement. I‚Äôm actually blown away tbh. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-07-13,"This movie is autobiographical. It&#39;s like delving into Hayo Miyazaki&#39;s long life feelings, thoughts and experiences. Miyazaki tries to tell us that in death, there is life. The line between life and death may be less distinct than we think. If we use our imagination we can find the real beauty in this world. Everyone must see this movie. It&#39;s been a month since i lost my father to cancer and this movie resonates with me so deeply. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I feel like this is a farewell from Miyazaki to all of us,a last gift with rich symbolism for us to unlock. ‚ù§"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-03,As a Japanese who have watched this film 10 times in Japan. This is masterpiece
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-04,"Perhaps the best by Miyazaki, the Studio Ghibli, of the Japanese Anime and among Japan movies, and may even be a triumph of philosophical history of mankind."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-24,Me and my friend saw this yesterday. One of the best studio ghibli movies ever. It is a masterpiece
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,I need to see the voice recording sessions of Robert Pattinson doing the Heron voice.
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-12-09,"Just watched it, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve seen before. It was  visually stunning,  strange yet inviting. I&#39;m so happy that I had the chance to watch a studio ghibli movie in a theater. ‚ù§"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-15,"Miyazakis ability to showcase the beauty of the world through animation is crazy. <br><br>The way the colors, shadows etc it feels like being there. Like a distant memory. Its like you been in that exact place before and know How the wind and temperature feels"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-10,Amazing news! The Boy and the Heron won the Academy Award for Best Animated FeatureüéÜüèÜüéâüéä!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-08,"I wish this a animation style was more prevalent these days , it draws out emotion in characters so well üëè"
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-12-30,"I just saw this for the first time a few days ago. As I was watching the movie I was only like half-enjoying it, then near the end, out of nowhere I got super emotional, and now the movie has really stuck with me since that viewing."
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-11-25,This movie is the culmination of everything that Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki learned over the years in making films. It&#39;s a total and complete Masterpiece!
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2023-11-02,The music is already perfect. Can&#39;t wait for the nostalgic sadness I feel 8 years from now relistening to the soundtrack
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-03-11,a so well deserved oscar! congratulation! :)
The Boy and the Heron,t5khm-VjEu4,2024-01-08,And this film just won the 2024 Golden Globe for <i>Best Animated Film.</i><br><br><b>Update 3/10/2024:</b><br>Now it just won the 2024 Oscar for <i>Best Animated Film.</i>
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Anytime Dave Bautista wears glasses, you know he&#39;s gonna give the performance of a lifetime."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-23,"Man, Dave is growing so much as an actor. It‚Äôs great to see. He‚Äôs a legitimately great dramatic performer now, totally believable"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"I am so proud of Dave. He chose a film career in a much more artistic way than all the other bling-ass wrestlers. And he didn&#39;t just choose them because of the content, but he also justifies each and every role he takes. A truly credible man."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-05-18,"The best thing about this movie was Dave. Honestly I didn&#39;t expected much from him but he leaves a mark, he was so good."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Bautista straight brings it. He chose a better film career path than other wrestler turned actors. I wonder what they think of him‚Ä¶also nice seeing Rupert Grint lately!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I‚Äôm happy Bautista is getting real acting roles instead of just being the big strong guy in movies.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"While M Night Shyamalan is hit or miss, when he does low budget thrillers he‚Äôs at his best."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-27,"Dave Bautista carried the movie, but everyone else was amazing. I also liked Rupert, he had a small time on screen but the way his desperation was shown was top notch, all of the four really seemed like they were on their tip toes."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-24,&quot;But my heart is broken.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it broken?&quot;<br>&quot;Because of what I have to do today.&quot;<br>CHILLS. I&#39;m so excited for this film.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Reminder this was shot with 90s lenses. It‚Äôs gonna have a very unique feel in the theater. Can‚Äôt wait!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"As someone who has read the book, I always wondered who will play Leonard. To me, he is the most interesting character. Crazy, but also loving. Never would have thought of Bautista to be playing Leonard, but oh man, his casting is spot on.<br><br>Big, hulking dude who has very much a psychopath storyline but also has a loving heart. This is gonna be a good portrayal."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-08-30,"Watched this last night. Still in awe. Great writing, acting and visuals. 10/10 in my book."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I‚Äôm glad people get to see how great of an actor Batista really is. Best actor to come out of wrestling for sure.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"i know M Night gets a lot of hate, but he&#39;s actually one of the most creative and thrilling directors! Although his movies are hit or miss, when he has a hit it&#39;s a HIT!!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"I unironically love Shyamalan and can&#39;t wait to see this. His movies may be really dumb some times, but they always manage to feel fresh and different compared to most Hollywood drivel."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-23,"Character development in this movie is second to none! Well done all, fantastic movie."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I love that Shyamalan gives each movie a distinctive look.  This doesnt look like other movies.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Unnerving, unsettling, creepy, and insane. Everything a film like this should be. Excited for this one."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I love the trailers like this that don‚Äôt tell us too much but get us so excited for the movie.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-03-07,"If you say Dave Bautista is theatre level performer and I&#39;ve never known about him before, I&#39;d be convinced. But because I know where he&#39;d started first, I&#39;m even more convinced."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-26,the little girl is amazing!!! the genuine fear in her eyes it‚Äôs so chilling at her age. can‚Äôt wait to see this.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-23,I love the trailers like this
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I loved the book and this actually looks good. Plus it has Jonathan Groff in it which is always a good thing!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-25,"I had never seen or heard of Dave Bautista, but the moment he walked on screen I was blown away! <br>He just has a ‚Äúpresence‚Äù that steals every scene he is in. <br>Loved it"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Wow, Rupert Grint is also in the movie, it&#39;s great to see Ron Weasley back :)"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,It&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t even mention the book this was based on by Paul Trembly. It&#39;s so well written and he deserves the credit.<br>Edit: some asshole left spoilers in this comment thread so don‚Äôt open it if you want to avoid spoilers.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"I really do love M. Night movies. <br>Even if they‚Äôre terribly and super cringe at times, I feel like he‚Äôs one of those rare directors (like a Nolan) that simply gets to make whatever movie he wants to make and it‚Äôs gets a mainstream platform theatrical release. <br>The man, for better or worse, has never comprised on his choices for the last 20 years of filmmaking. Not an endorsement of his bad films (we can all agree he‚Äôs made some horrible Dreck) but I can‚Äôt help but be excited when he puts a new movie out that is specifically his style."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-09-07,"watched this a few days ago.. really good film! I had no idea it was M. Night, until i saw him lol. Really proud of Dave Bautista, after seeing him in Bladerunner 2049, i hoped to see him more in emotionally deep roles. I can&#39;t wait to watch it again!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-02,for those who haven&#39;t read the book....... boy are you in for a ride that&#39;s gonna make you angry. and i mean that in the best way possible
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-25,So excited to see Jonathan Groff get more roles like this.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-03,"Just saw this in the cinema. Extremely uncomfortable movie, many close-ups, lots of emotions and twists. No blood or gore just pure psych thrills and chills! Bautista&#39;s performance is top as is the rest of the cast. I give it an 8 of 10"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-03-03,"never leave a review online about movies, but this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just wish I can unsee this movie."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-10-02,Bautista is the man!  So proud of him and his acting career!  And look at Rupert too!  M Night really pulled together a great team!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I loved the book and wasn&#39;t even aware they were making an adaptation.  I&#39;m freaking out at this trailer. This is going to be fantastic!!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-28,"So‚Ä¶. Mitch, Cam, and Lily go on vacation and Mitch has a bad paranoid dream‚Ä¶ got it üòÇ"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2024-11-10,Dave Bautista is killing it in his acting career! So glad we get to see more versatile characters that he plays..This was a great movie and Dave was amazing.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Well dang this might actually be one of the better M. Night movies
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"i love trailers like this that catches your attention by the mood of the music, how the music switches into something ominous, uses sounds as beats with physical action and doesn&#39;t show you much of what the movie may be about. especially since this is from M Night Shyamalan i cant wait it to see the twist and turns. and since there&#39;s 2 other screenwriters it might be better since he has his own unique way to end his films, this might be different and actually good."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-25,"Just read the book a few weeks ago and I am so excited. It looks so far to be pretty faithful to the original, and if it continues that way, it is going to be a fantastic movie"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-03-26,That little girl is awesome!  David is such a good actors!  Love it ‚ù§
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Okay, I really loved the book, and when I heard that it was being adapted into a film I was really skeptical, but I have to admit that this looks pretty good! The characters don‚Äôt look how I imagined them, but honestly that‚Äôs not something that matters to me. I just hope that they stay true to the beautifully-grim plot of that novel by Paul tremblay!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-23,OMG the little actress‚Äôs range is insane‚Ä¶ Super star actress in the making üòÆ
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Wow the trailer is almost exactly like the beginning of the book. Down to the position of the characters when they enter the house and the dad&#39;s reactions.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-03-25,Loved this movie. Kept me on pins and needles and wondering whether it was actually happening or if they were crazy
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,The four strangers are obviously the four horsemen of the apocalypse as they are also rocking the same colors of the four horsemen on their shirts.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-06,"I once heard three loud knocks on my front door at 3 am. I was right next to my front door and when i heard them, i turned around and i could see through the window of my front door that there was absolutely no one. I quickly glanced outside and there was no one at all. This only happened once and never again. Guess they changed their mind about me be the chosen one but jokes aside, this spooked me and ever since then, i get a little paranoid at night time and look at the windows from time to time."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,God damn this looks good. This is how trailers for horror movies should be done. They probably showed only the first 25 minutes of the movie tops and showed only what they needed to to catch audiences attention. Can‚Äôt wait to see it.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-09-14,Dave Bautista should win every award possible for his acting in this movie
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,For those that already read the book will know the end but Shaymalan will surely add his own twist at the story.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I had no idea they were making this book into a movie! The book still haunts me to this day. Looks very good.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-26,Dave Bautista‚Äôs delivery of the lines here are genuinely spooky and gave me chills!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-04-30,Opening dialogue is 3 minutes of &quot;I have 2 dads&quot; &quot;is it weird to have 2 dads&quot; &quot;I like having 2 dads&quot;... Woke dialogue in 2023 smfh
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,They‚Äôre just here to talk to the dads about their car‚Äôs extended warranty.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-24,"‚ÄúThe most important job in the history of the world‚Äù<br><br>With a line like that, this better be good"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-23,I am so proud of Batista. Growing up he was one of my heroes in pro wrestling. So to see him become such a character driven actor is so refreshing and heart warming !!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-21,If you switch the sort of comments from top to newest you actually get a reverse uno.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-06,The knocking sounds give me chills
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-20,"Just finished the book 10/10! Amazing, can&#39;t wait for this, plus great cast and director."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,I clicked on the trailer out of pure chance. <br><br>As soon as I saw M. Night Shyamalan pop-up on the screen...I knew we were in for a ride.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-26,"Just saw this movie.<br>This movie has a lot of different opinions but I LOVED IT!... Amazing! Very powerfull, heavy, touching, amazing! Wow!<br>It&#39;s also very, very creative and wow... Loved it!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"With the kind of characters Dave is playing lately, it looks like an Oscar might not be far away."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-24,I&#39;m just addicted to M. Night Shyamalan. Even his more infamous movies like Lady in the water has his signature kindness oozing. Hope this one is a masterpiece like Unbreakable.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"KING IS BACK. No matter what you think of him, M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most original directors of our time. Hella excited for this."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-08-19,This movie really was interesting and heart wrenching. I didn‚Äôt expect to cry at the end but I FELT it. Will watch again!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Don&#39;t care what people say about m. Night films, they&#39;re always fun to watch!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-25,Dave Bautista has come a long way in his acting career!! He‚Äôs going to absolutely nail it in this movie!!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-23,Jonathan Groff! Loved him in Mindhunter so I can‚Äôt wait to see him in this
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-08-13,"Excellent, great job for Dave Bautista, and Rupert Grint and the rest of the cast were extraordinary."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-25,"Happy to see Rupert on screen again, it&#39;s been a long time!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Wow, I read this book, and the shots look exactly the way I pictured it in my head!  Can&#39;t wait for this!!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-27,M. Night deserves a lifetime achievement award for trailers
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2025-01-06,"If you are watching this trailer before watching the movie, then it is not going to be worth it."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-27,Someone pointed out a great detail. Bautista and his cohorts are wearing shirt colors that symbolize the four horsemen of the apocalypse.<br>From left to right. Black for Famine. Yellow in place of Pale for Death. Bautista is wearing a white shirt for Conquest. And the guy in red represents War.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-25,"I love how Bautista keeps choosing Auteurs to work with. Denis Villeneuve, Zack Snyder, M Night, Rian Johnson. Man&#39;s got an amazing taste when it comes to choosing roles."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"wow !! i‚Äôm surprised this much was shown in an M . Night Shyamalan trailer , this looks great!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-08-10,Just finished watching this movie üé• it was Excellent!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-24,Dave has been killing it. Love watching anything he‚Äôs in.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-27,Dave is such an underrated actor I swear he kills it in every role can‚Äôt wait to see this üî•
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-24,This is based on the book The Cabin At The End of The World. I&#39;m actually glad to see Shaymalan taking on a work based on another writers work. It will be cool to see what he does with it!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-04-20,Either people accept it or not dave is on another level compared to the rock. Well done for this masterpiece!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-04,"Dave Bautista is an incredible actor, I hope studios cast him more!"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,"Huge fan of Shyamalan. Love his style of thrillers especially the ones with a massive plot twist like The sixth sense, The village, Devil (he was a co-writer in that), etc. Can anyone please suggest more such movies please??"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-12-02,"Jonathan Groff in M Night movie, I‚Äôm there"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-03-21,Why are the TRAILERS for M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s movies always WAY better than the actual MOVIE?
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-03,Nothing will convince you to stay out of the woods like M. Night Shyamalan.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-05,This is definitely something I‚Äôll check out. I‚Äôll never forget meeting Dave in the airport in Detroit the following morning after Wrestlemania 23. Very nice guy and I still have the autograph.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Wow! Can&#39;t wait! Love Jonathan Groff and Rupert Grint!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2025-03-11,Jonathan Groff: You‚Äôll be back<br>Rupert Grint: Whoooahh
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-10-28,This looks really good. I didn‚Äôt think David  Bautista could pull a role like this off when I heard he was cast. How wrong I was! He delivers that sombre terror just fine!! Cannot wait to see it on the big screen with a large üçø
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,The fact that this much was shown excites me cause obviously M Night always has twists and turns so if the trailer lets us know that much then there is another bigger twist lurking in the shadows. (My guess is the twist is that they are telling the truth and the apocalypse is real but maybe the family doesn‚Äôt have to die for it‚Ä¶ not likely)
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-27,"I really, really love what Batista is doing with his career. His acting gets better and better and he doesnt let himself get typecast into the big unstoppable brute in every film. I think he could someday be nominated for a performance."
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2025-02-03,"If 2025, this movie makes more sense now. Its related to what is going on currently"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-09,"This is how a trailer should be. I watched the film, and this trailer covers just the first 20-25 minutes. ü§Ø"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,Always exited for more Shyamalan! And this time with Dave Bautista?! Cinema!
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-27,Say what you will about M Night but he never fails to come up with super interesting premises even if they fall short at times
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2024-11-19,"i noticed nearly 10 yrs ago that if Dave Bautista is in a film, any film, it&#39;ll be well worth my while to watch it. and he has never let me down, Hotel Artemus, Gardians of the Galaxy, Chronicles of Riddick, even in the Bladerunner update which just left me flat, his performance was nuanced and memorable. R"
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2022-09-22,This is based off one of my fav books of all time! They better not change the ending üò©
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-01-28,Jonathan Groff acting is SOO good I know i‚Äôm gonna watch this multiple times
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-03,Can absolutely FEEL the weight of the acting from Dave here. Love it.
Knock at the Cabin,0wiBHEACNHs,2023-02-23,"Horror movies have always had a special place in the hearts of movie lovers. These movies have the ability to scare us, leave us on the edge of our seats, and give us a thrill that we just can&#39;t get from any other genre. The trailer for the upcoming horror movie has just been released, and it&#39;s already giving me chills!<br><br>The trailer starts with a dark, ominous tone, setting the mood for what&#39;s to come. We see a young family moving into a new home, which seems like a dream come true. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse when they begin to experience strange occurrences that they can&#39;t explain. As the trailer progresses, we see the family being terrorized by an unseen force, with each scare getting more intense than the last.<br><br>One of the things that I love about horror movies is how they can make us feel like we&#39;re right there in the action. The trailer for this movie does an excellent job of immersing us in the story, with its use of sound, lighting, and camera angles. The tension builds throughout the trailer, leaving us with a sense of dread that we just can&#39;t shake.<br><br>The characters in the trailer are also well-developed, with the family being portrayed as relatable and sympathetic. We can&#39;t help but feel sorry for them as they&#39;re being terrorized, and we want to see them make it out alive. The unseen force that&#39;s terrorizing them is also portrayed in a way that makes it seem almost human, adding an extra layer of complexity to the story.<br><br>As a horror movie fan, I&#39;m always looking for movies that can scare me, and the trailer for this movie certainly does that. The use of jump scares, suspenseful music, and creepy visuals all work together to create a sense of unease that just won&#39;t go away. I can already imagine watching this movie with all the lights off and my heart racing, wondering what&#39;s going to happen next.<br><br>While some people might shy away from horror movies because they&#39;re too scary, I believe that they&#39;re an important part of cinema. Horror movies can make us face our fears and push us out of our comfort zones. They can also be a way for us to explore deeper themes and ideas that we might not otherwise be able to confront.<br><br>In conclusion, the trailer for this upcoming horror movie has me excited and scared all at the same time. It&#39;s clear that the filmmakers have put a lot of thought and care into creating a story that will keep us on the edge of our seats. I can&#39;t wait to see what happens to the family, and to be scared out of my mind in the process!"

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-08-01,This movie was soo good! The plot twists were intense and the acting was spot on! One of the most underrated movies I‚Äôve seen!! Definitely a must watch
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-07-23,"I love how the whole movie is film in like a webcam, phone, smartwatch type of video. Like the cinematography is so unique."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,Searching was so underrated. And this looks just as intense as that film.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-29,The plot twist was amazing. It made me doubt every single person in the movie to be the kidnapper except for the person who is the kidnapper. Awesome movie.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-14,"I normally can‚Äôt stand these computer POV movies, but this one was done extremely well and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I swear as soon as I thought I had the plot figured out, something would completely flip it upside down. Very clever movie."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,The scary thing is this been happening in real life people be going missing on these vacations.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,"Searching was a masterclass in visual storytelling and one of the best films I saw in 2018, was nervous when they announced a sequel, surely the original was lightning in a bottle. But I have to say I&#39;m excited after seeing the trailer and hope this manages to recapture the magic (please give this a proper theatrical release in the UK!)"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-22,What in the world?! This was one of the best movies I seen in a long time! I was all over the place emotionally with this movie and I loved every minute of it! Bravo! Bravo!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-23,"As a person who watched the movie, I can say it lived up to its expectations. GREAT movie. I recommend you watch it."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-08,"This movie was amazing, I give it a 9.5/10. It was intense, kept me at the edge of my seat, made me cry a lot, and the twists are soooo good. I love when movies have unexpected twists like that. And Storm Reid is incredible, she‚Äôs so talented. I love that recently she‚Äôs in both Missing and an episode of The last of us. She‚Äôs incredibly talented and an amazing actress"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,Storm Reid is a great actress. Can‚Äôt wait to see her in this.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-17,Searching is one of the best and most underrated movies I‚Äôve seen in quite a long time. It still gets me every time I watch it. The way they did that movie was genius and this looks just as good!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-16,"Just watched this and I must say this is a great film! Great suspense build-up and plot twists. Totally recommend to watch this movie. Also this movie is family-friendly (no intimacy, vulgarity scenes) so this movie would be perfect to watch with your kids!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-09,This movie literally made me think that everyone except junebug might be a suspect. Still can&#39;t get over the plot of searching but this one made me double check every detail from the beginning of this movie. Couldn&#39;t imagine the process of making this film. Like how they really pulled this genre perfectly. I wish there&#39;ll be more of this soon
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-07-16,I was skeptical about this movie but I just watched it and it was sooooo good from beginning to end. So many twists and turns. Absolutely loved it!!!!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-17,The first one was really good
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-17,"so excited to see Storm Reid in this, she&#39;s been killing it on Euphoria! also what a perfect way to do a sequel to such a one-of-a-kind film. the first one had so many twists &amp; turns I did not see coming and it looks like this one will too. but the emotional core (a parent searching for their child/a child searching for their parent because the law let them down) is still there, just reversed."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-25,Holy cow!  Just saw this. Haven&#39;t heard anyone talking about it but wanted to see it based on the trailer alone.  We were not disappointed!  This was an amazing thriller that had us on the edge of our seats the entire time and definitely had an unexpected ending. Did not see that coming!  So good.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-22,JUST FINISHED WATCHING. GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS OMG THE BEST MOVIE I&#39;VE SEEN IN 2023 SO FAR
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-29,I saw the movie üçø tonight with my daughter. We thought it was suspenseful with lots of twists and turns that kept us engaged. It was an original concept for a major motion picture. I give it a thumbs up! The theater goers applauded when the movie ended.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-26,The twists are crazy. They‚Äôre so unexpected. This film was visually so pleasing to watch. Great editing and good work on the story line!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-25,"I like the idea that this time a daughter has to save her mother, usually in all kidnapping or disappearance movies the father or mother must rescue their children, but I am interested that this time it is the other way around. &lt;3"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-20,This film was insane! So well written! Love that it had similarities to Searching but still can stand out as if it was a stand alone film! So well done! Let the writers do a third film.... Im sure theyll nail it..
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-31,"legit movie. the twists are insane, a must watch."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-08-05,"Best movie I‚Äôve seen this year!!! Not like the regular missing narratives, the plot twists are SICKENING!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-03,"The editors of Searching killed it, can&#39;t wait to watch this."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,What would make this movie so good is that if a searching easter egg shows up in this movie to connect the to movies together as if it was in the same universe like she can have a Facebook friend of Margot from searching or when she is having trouble finding her parents she could find an article of David Kim finding Margot Kim
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,I got this as an ad and watched the whole thing üò≠ I wanna watch it
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-10,Just saw this today; it&#39;s MUCH better than the trailers make it out to be. This only shows the first 30 minutes or so.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-23,"one of the best movies of 2023, there are so many plot twists and I don&#39;t even know how they came up with this, Completely unpredictable and 10/10 it looks amazing I love how apple products are being used and the plot twists go from trying to understand and then it starts to add up and then you break and don&#39;t understand and it&#39;s mindblowing."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-04-25,Just got out of watching this and I HIGHLY recommend. I was worried that the trailer gave away way to much and that the movie would be predictable but I was so WRONG! Movie was great and easy to follow with great characters that you could get attached to. Do watch this!!!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-17,"Storm Reid gets the lead role she deserves!! About time, Hollywood!!!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,The first one was really good can‚Äôt wait for this one
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-06-28,"I didn&#39;t have high expectations for this film going in, but was pleasantly surprised! Good movie, good plot, &amp; had me heavily invested lol. Would recommend!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-28,"Just finished watching this and it was soooo good. Rarely does a movie jump out of my seat and say ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù with chills down my spine, but this made me not once but multiple times. The music, the acting everything was so good. Also‚Ä¶ (spoilers below)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>When they revealed it wasn‚Äôt the mom on the plane‚Ä¶HOLY SHIT"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-25,The first one was downright amazing with the way it showed it story. Searching was a cinematic success and I really hope this movie catches the same heavy weight the first one did.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-18,Searching was AMAZING. I can&#39;t wait for this sequel. Im glad its a whole different story.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-04-06,üò≤Unfreaking BELIEVABLE WOW!!!<br>ABSOLUTELY NOBODY WILL EXPECT THE ENDING <br>MISSING DESERVES..A EMMY &amp; A OSCAR üëèüëèüëè‚ò∫Ô∏è
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-10,This movie was fast paced with a lot of twists and turns.  Really enjoyed it.  Would love to go again to see it with my adult kids.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-10,This was a brilliant watch. OMG the amount of twists and turns this movie took was insane and had me on the edge of my seat. 10/10 movie.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-18,"I&#39;m quite excited to see this film, I need to watch Searching too. But what I really like is how it highlights a situation most don&#39;t think about. All your life, you&#39;re told to worry about your kids. Never take your eyes from them, keep a hand or one of those leash backpacks on them, etc. Which isn&#39;t bad, kids are easy targets being smaller and weaker.<br><br>But this is highlighting how parents can be taken. I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;look out for your mom&quot; growing up unless she wasn&#39;t feeling well. But shouldn&#39;t we look out for them? Aren&#39;t children naturally responsive to a new man or woman their parents date? I was not a fan of my stepdad when my mom and him met because it&#39;s always just been mommy and me so why this new person in our life? Seriously though, it really is something I think everyone should be aware of."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,"The first one was great, can&#39;t wait to see this one!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-21,"Searching was so good and almost brought me to tears. Because this one is about a mommy and daughter, I know I&#39;m gonna be bawling. I&#39;m so excited!"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-07-13,"SPOILERS!!!!! <br>This movie is immaculate, made me ball my eyes out for the first time in awhile and i really connected with my mom with all the funky plot twist‚Äôs, i kinda predicted her dad and kevin were working together and he was the bad guy etc, but i was still shocked and i actually cried so hard when grace/sarah got shot, after the movie i immediately texted my mom and said i loved her.<br>Appreciate ur parents ppl, u may never know when u cant talk to them anymore"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-10-16,I just finished this movie and it was absolutely one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I could guess some of what was going on but a lot of it was shocking and surprising which I loved. There were no boring points and I will definitely be watching it again at some point. Good enough that I would watch it with my boyfriend tomorrow just to get his reaction.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-02-27,"Just finished it. Great movie, great story telling and a lot of plot twists. I am very picky when it comes to movies but this one is worth it. Might no be good for older people as some things are happening quite quickly and it&#39;s more of a Gen z approach with all that internet and social media surfing but that&#39;s actually the reality in 2023. We&#39;re all deep into the net with all our accounts and personal info. I really liked it! Recommend it for sure."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-16,I loved Searching and watching this gave me goosebumps üî•
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-10,"Just finished this movie and it was pretty darn good. The girl was smart, and I don&#39;t mean book smart but her insight and resourcefulness was very impressive. Definitely worth watching."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-08-13,Just finished watching this. This is in my top 5 favorite movies now.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2024-08-19,When you thought you already knew what was happening but the plot twists was still there.. i got goosebumps! So underrated movie!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-10,This movie was really good everyone should go watch it I swear!!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-10,I saw this tonight as the Regal Mystery Movie. It&#39;s great. Clever and tense throughout. Highly recommend seeing at a packed theater.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-16,"This looks promising as a sequel, wonder if John Cho will make a cameo."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-28,This movie was so good! I haven‚Äôt seen a well written Netflix movie is ages.

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-16,I got to give this film A+++ for its orginality. Looks good. Trailer kinda seems to give away the film
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-26,I get chills whenever he mentions if her mom goes by different names. So intriguing.

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-30,It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve watched a really good suspenseful movie at the theaters. This was worth it. It got me a few times with the twists and turns as I pride myself in figuring out who did what early on.
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-11-17,At first I thought this movie was cancelled but now I&#39;m so freaking EXCITED I been waiting for this

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-15,This looks like a great movie already
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2025-02-20,"One of the best films I‚Äôve seen , definitely should watch"
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2024-01-14,The scriptwriters definitely need a raise after this movie! Everything about it was top notch and well written and directed as well!<br>9.5/10

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2024-01-13,Good job giving away the plot in the trailer.

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-07-09,"When she said &quot;...SIRI&quot;, I said &quot;CALL 911&quot; and she said it too! I HAD GOOSEGUMPS.<br>I&#39;ve never felt that in any movie for so long up until now. And why I love this movie a lot because of the happy ending. This movie is SO good!!! üíù"

Missing,seBixtcx19E,2022-12-08,I got goosebumps this looks amazing
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-03-17,"Just watched this movie. It&#39;s a masterpiece of a thriller movie presenting online searching, using the tools available online and focussing on a computer screen most of the time. I give it 9.5/10, indeed."
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-01-23,I went to go see this on a whim yesterday and I honestly loved it. 10/10 üëç
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-05-28,One of the few sequels that surpasses the original. Definitely a great watch!
Missing,seBixtcx19E,2023-02-01,These guys know how to use sfx to enhance the movie. Creates incredible tension and emotion.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-04,"As a pilot, I can confirm this is very realistic to a normal working day"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-28,"Jolo Island in the Province of Sulu is one of the most dangerous places in the southernmost of the Philippines. This small island in the Sulu Sea is the base for Abu Sayyaf, an infamous group of rebels that are known to kidnap tourists for ransom, often targeting American citizens. <br><br>It was mentioned in the trailer that the Filipino army don&#39;t wanna go there anymore. But in reality, Jolo is a heavily militarized island. There are about 5,000 Philippine troops there, most of them concentrated near the town center.<br><br>Anyways, Gerard Butler is one badass actor! üî• Can&#39;t wait for this!"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-24,"Watched the film today, and as a Filipino and a tagalog speaker, i was giggling at the hostage takers coz of their slang tagalog accent. Apparently they hired filipino american actors for the movie. But nonetheless, the movie is great and I enjoyed it! Such a shame, our senators here in PH wanted to ban this movie on PH theaters. It‚Äôs a fictional movie. Truth be told, They just can‚Äôt accept the fact that hostage taking actually happens on those areas of the PH. Just those areas though. Never been there, no plans of going there. But hey, Philippines is such a beautiful country. Nature and people are our treasure. And just like any other countries, has its own flaws and imperfections we can‚Äôt hide."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-11-03,"When I&#39;m looking for a good movie and see Gerard Butler as one of the actors, no second thoughts, I watch it right away. üòäü•∞"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,It&#39;s Gerard butler... That&#39;s enough for me to buy the tickets. ‚úå
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,"Colter is always given a simple role, but he always adds his unique human touch each time. Whether it&#39;s a Marvel hero, a priest, or a ^misunderstood fugitive."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,"I still don&#39;t know why Gerald Butler isn&#39;t part of DC or Marvel, he mostly plays action films. He could make a very good hero. Obviously we&#39;ll still remember him as King Leonidas"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-26,This movie was so good. Very intense and an amazing story. I was definitely at the edge of my seat. And a few emotional parts as well. Gerard Butler is an incredible actor
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-19,The new season of LOST is looking crazy!
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-05,"I saw this during the week and what a pleasant surprise.  This is a great little movie, well acted, well written and well executed.  You wont find a more perfectly formed action film than this.  Go see it in the theater because we need more movies like this."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-05-13,Great straight forward movie. I love it. I feel safe during the entire movie knowing that Gerard Butler is there. I love that the plot is quite simple. No conspiracy what so ever. No traitor. Its just simply the good guys vs the bad guys.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-10,"My goodness this movie is a perfect package of action, suspense and pace! We thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. One of those films that keeps you on the edge until the last minute and makes you whistle and cheer for the survivors when credit rolls! Gerald Butler killed it once again. He is so apt for such badass roles."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-09,Standing right behind Gerard Butler when there&#39;s serious trouble is the safest place on the planet. Count me in on first day of theatre release
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-20,"Enjoyed the movie, It was more than i expected!! Full of action packed thriller, great cinematography, good casting, Gerard butler&#39;s performance was great as always!!"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-10-02,"Randomly picked this movie from &quot; movies on demand &quot; , Butler and Colter nailed thier roles perfectly. The movie was very well done , good action and gun battles.  It was fast paced and never had a dull moment , the reviews had 94% with the popcorn icon.  Good production , good filming , the acting and script was very well done. From the Actors that only had a few lines , to the main characters , I was impressed."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-28,"I just saw this movie today and it was amazing. I had seen the trailer first. I thought it was one of those trailers that revealed the whole movie, but no. There‚Äôs so much to it, definitely a must watch."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,"Gerard Butler and Mike Colter, two &quot;Spartans&quot; together , bad guys don&#39;t stand a chance."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-26,"I am a Filipino and I am opposed to our senators&#39; decision to ban this film. It is true that there are terrorists in the Philippines, which cannot be denied because every country has terrorists. I enjoy the film, particularly its star, GERARD BUTLER."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-25,"Producers: &quot;Guys! It&#39;s a gripping aviation thriller! Incredible action, edge of your seat suspense, extraordinary odds of survival - what do we call it??&quot;<br>Production team: &quot;Plane.&quot;<br>Producers: &quot;Brilliant!!!&quot;"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-29,"As a Filipino, it&#39;s just somewhat funny to hear that Jolo is pronounced as &#39;J&#39; as in DJOLO, instead of the common pronunciation of HOLO as in &#39;H&#39;."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-11,It&#39;s been long since Hollywood didn&#39;t delivered such action pack movies. The movie is intense and worth every penny!
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-27,Gerald Buter and Mike Colter in an action movie? Damn! I&#39;ll be the first in line.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-11-02,This will be a excellent movie in true Gerard fashion ! Gerard is a superb actor who has the unique quality too make every role he plays believable ! He has worked very hard too get where he is and has a very promising career!

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-14,Saw the film last night. It was excellent. A throw back to the 90s action movies like Die Hard. Get a large popcorn and Pepsi and enjoy the ride!
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-11,"Olympus Has Fallen, London Has Fallen, Angel Has Fallen, and now Plane Has Fallen. üòÇ"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-10,"Just rented and watched it last night on Amazon Prime video and it&#39;s 100% badass! Gerard Butler never disappoints. He&#39;s such an amazing actor. And Mike Colter was perfect as the accused murderer turned good bad guy. The actors who played Dele the Co-pilot and Bonnie, the Chief flight attendant were great as well. And can&#39;t forget Tony Goldwyn. I almost didn&#39;t recognize him. Edge-of-your-seat suspense and action! I swear my anxiety went into overdrive watching this lol. Great cast and what an emotional rollercoaster. My rental is good for 48 hours so I&#39;m definitely gonna watch it again. A must-watch if you love action and suspense! üëçüëçüëç"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-10,Exactly when Gerard Butler is in any movie count me inüëçüèΩ!! This movie is going to be epic!!!

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,You had me at Mike ‚ÄúLuke Cage‚Äù Colter and Daniella Pineda.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,This could very well be the most Lionsgate movie that ever Lionsgated.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-04,This is the first good hollywood movie I watched in 2023.<br>Finally after waiting a long time to find a good movie.<br>Very very good movie and highly recommended.<br>Hollywood should focus on these instead of the tiresome superhero garbage.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-28,I see Luke Cage am like yeah am watching this lol Mike Colter is such a great actor in anything he does.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-26,"Producer: okay guys we need a title for this film. In the first scene, they‚Äôre on a plane, but in the rest-<br>Other producer: how about ‚Äúplane‚Äù<br>Producer: ‚Ä¶..Yes."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-03-19,"As a Filipino who really lives in the Philippines at Jolo,Sulu. its not easy for me to watch it because the gunshoot, bombing, cutting head, kidnapping etc we all did heard that happend in our placed or worse experienced it. really terrifying to live in a place where you feel not secured or safe. the tension between Filipino military and Abu sayaf way back then. ü•∫ hoping one day we could have a better place to live peacefully."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-11-13,I am a Filipino and I am grateful that the film featured a Philippine island. I hope more Hollywood movies will give exposure to the Philippines.   SMall correction: Jolo is pronounced as &quot;HOLO&quot; not &quot;dyolo&quot;.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-05,How have movies like this and 65 not gained that much hype yet? They both look great! Definitely seeing them in theaters.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-06-01,"This movie is very entertaining from the beginning to the end. It reminds me a lot of all the old action movies that was great back in the days, hopefully the new Top Gun movie showed Hollywood that the audience loves these simple entertaining flicks.<br><br>Grab some snacks, relax and watch this one, i promise, you will have a great time with it."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-09,Omg I love both these gentleman&#39;s acting skills always have can&#39;t hardly wait to see this movie üçøüé• looks like it&#39;s going to be so damn good action packed

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2024-04-15,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Once you start watching it, its impossible to stop. It never gets old when rewatching it. I love it."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-21,Just saw this tonight. Was a perfect action film. Butler is the perfect Everyman hero we all need.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-11-18,"Wow! It is such a honor and a privilege to see Gerald Butler as a tough guy after the plane crashes and Mike Colter play a great firefighter in Breakthrough and he was a great superhero in Luke Cage. I am looking forward to watching Lost now that they are taking it back to 2004 with Naveen Andrews, Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Daniel Dae Kim, and many more."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-14,"Excellent movie! It&#39;s worth it to go see at the theater due to the incredibly realistic effects you feel like you are in the plane. Every minute of this movie is awesome  and of course I went to see it because of Gerard Butler but I was surprised, Best movie ever. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-06,"I pretty much watch anything Gerard Butler is in, always awesome and a great action hero. Should have called this Plane Has Fallen, another sequel to the other two &quot;--Has Fallen&quot; movies that Butler did. (London , Angel Has Fallen)"

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-27,"Let me guess, they save most of the passengers, Butler takes them home, Colter is allowed to walk off to his freedom.<br><br>I&#39;ll still watch this."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-27,Now we&#39;ve Leonidas &amp; Luke Cage together hence nothin&#39; to worry about.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-03-04,"I&#39;m a Filipino-American and definitely going to see this movie not just because it&#39;s a Gerald Butler movie, a surely great and box-office movie, but also, I&#39;m very proud of my origin country, the Philippines üáµüá≠that you should also visit because we have so many amazing and beautiful tourist locations that you should not missed to visit as I can assure you when you experience it, it&#39;s going to be your unforgettable visit to the country because of the beauty of its nature and how good the Filipino peope are!    <br>This movie may have given a bad reputations to the Filipino people, but in reality, we all live in an imperfect üåé world.

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-05-29,"Just watched this on Amazon Prime. What a great movie. Gerard Butler&#39;s pilot was such a clutch guy. Incredible pilot, saved the passengers, and took out the kidnappers. He was fully in his Lebron 2012 v Celtics / Kobe 70 point game mode."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-04,Gerard Butler should be in every action film.
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-07,I&#39;ve been a Gerard Butler fan for a solid decade. I&#39;ll he&#39;ll keep getting my money because he&#39;s a great entertainer and actor. Keep up the good work.

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-14,Can we get a Liam Neeson and Butler together for a movie. I think that&#39;s needed
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-15,"I knew I&#39;d be watching once I saw Gerard, but my heart completely melted the moment I realized Tony was in this too. Sincerely, a die-hard Scandal fan! ‚ù§"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-22,"A Filipino Senator, want to ban this in Philippine Theaters, simply put this is not the real status of the country according to him. This is just a movie! , not a true to life re-enactment."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-08,Saw this movie when it first came out on 2/13/23. Watched it 3 different times. Gerard Butler and Mike Colter are awesome together. I am waiting for the second one that they are talking about ‚ù§
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-30,"What a shame for the Philippines in banning this exceptional movie! Perhaps the higher-ups were ashamed of the reality of the country. Despite all the efforts, there are still terrorists lurking in the archipelago."

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-16,"What a great action packed movie! I definitely watch this one on cinema.<br>But, there&#39;s a possibility that the showing of it will be banned here in the Philippines because it was strongly condemned by some Senators yesterday (2.16.2023) during their regular session due to the negative depiction of the country."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-10-26,Leonidas &amp; Luke Cage together! Say Less. üî•
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-20,"I love it when a trailer is just a condensed version of the movie, giving you no reason to see it in theaters"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-04-21,"Mike Banning, Luke Cage, Chen Honghui, Zia Rodriguez"
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-01-20,I hope this does well at the box office Butler deserves it and the movie looks top!

Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-16,"Been to Sulu as a solo tourist, the island is far from this. Though a good movie but as a Mindanaoan fighting for change from painting our island a bad image for years, I find this movie contributes harm than good to the islands of Sulu and Mindanao. Now Hollywood is pointing towards Philippines as bad after middle east, this is unacceptable."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-04,Gerard Butler makes the same movie over and over again and we&#39;re here for it.....again and again and again!
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2022-12-01,"The title makes it seem like a placeholder title that the screenwriter put on the title page when he first started and thought: ‚ÄúEh, I‚Äôll think of a better one later.‚Äù<br>And then no one ever did."
Plane,M25zXBIUVr0,2023-02-19,I Love this Movie The actors and their characters are awesome.. I am against the banning of this movie here in our Country the Philippines.. Gerard Butler is awesome.. keep it up Dude.. üòéüëç

65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-01-26,i avoided this movie like the plague for a year because critics said it was boring and sucked. i caught it on HBO the other day and loved it. i seriously need to stop watching reviews lol
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,If this movie makes dinosaurs feel like frightening beasts that would be right outside your window while you sleep then I&#39;m all for it. I like the atmosphere it gives and the question of &quot;are they going to survive&quot;. Because the dinos are the least of their worries
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,A DINOSAUR movie that isn‚Äôt from the Jurassic franchise? I‚Äôm so in.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,Adam Driver fighting Dinosaurs with sci-fi technology is something I never even knew I needed until now! And Dinosaurs are actually terrifying again! I‚Äôm hyped.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-07-10,I dont unsterstand  all the bad reviews on this film. Just watched it and had a great time with it. Adam driver was realy good in it too.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,"Finally, an acknowledgement for how terrifying it would be to live in this period. No hole small enough that something couldn‚Äôt eat you"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,This is so damn refreshing to see a movie that&#39;s not a remake/sequel/prequel. I feel like that&#39;s all we&#39;ve been getting in recent years.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-12-22,"You know, I thought of a concept like this too if I were ever to make movies. A film about astronauts crash landing on a planet with dinosaur type aliens. But this is better than what I thought. People from another planet crash landing on prehistoric Earth where the dinosaurs are aliens to their eyes. Genius."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,Haven‚Äôt felt the fear of dinosaurs in a film in so long. This looks insaneee. Adam Driver is gonna kill it
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,This is new. Seeing Adam Driver in a solo movie without any big names and with what looks like a great plot seems great to me.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,I actually kind of like this plotline as a &quot;humans are really alien colonists on Earth&quot; style of twist; it will be interesting to see where they go with it in this movie.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-05-27,"Just finished this movie and it was sooo damn good! Talk about intense AF! Don‚Äôt listen to the critics. If you want to watch it, watch it. It was worth every minute."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,Clearly Adam for a long time missed his calling to be in survival horror films. Some how he‚Äôs actually perfect for this and it shows in the trailer. Hope he gets cast in more.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-19,"This is basically a Dinosaur movie in an Alien/Xenomorph fashion, almost looks like Alien Covenant but with Dinosaurs, absolutely amazing"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"This gives off major Dino crisis vibes. I‚Äôm so glad we are getting a horror oriented dinosaur movie, I‚Äôve waited a long time for such movie. Universal, take notes!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-07-12,My mom and I just watched this and we were on the edge of our seats the whole time! So good
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Wow, I‚Äôm so happy that someone at Hollywood remembered that dinosaurs(while amazing) are horrifying creatures. I can‚Äôt wait!!!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Looks like he&#39;s not letting go of the past, but he is killing it."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-24,"Y‚Äôall, if Sam Raimi‚Äôs been involved, it‚Äôs gonna be a thriller. And I‚Äôm in for it."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-07-09,"I ended up seeing the movie and while not re-inventing  the wheel, I found it to be a pretty entertaining movie, making most of its budget, cast and locations. The budget is blessedly not $450 million dollars or whatever Hollywood keeps spending on these tired, empty and dying blockbusters. <br><br>It has pretty good production values and an ideal runtime for this type of movie. It isn&#39;t a remake, reboot, sequel or prequel. That is definitely a bonus. Plus, I liked the setting and timing of the movie. I saw it has pretty low scores and negative reviews and I am not sure any of it is deserved. But that&#39;s just me."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-20,I love it when a movie comes along that&#39;s able to hook me just on the premise alone.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-16,"A brand new original movie that&#39;s not a sequel, reboot or in a franchise for once?! FINALLY!üòäüëçüèª"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-16,Sam Raimi making a movie with Adam Driver with dinosaurs? Holy hell I&#39;m actually excited for this whether it turns out good or bad
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2025-05-01,"The revelation of the disturbing elements based on mystery and suspense of form, are exceptional. Very inspiring for scenarios. The acting of Adam and the girl are masterful. There are mistakes but we only remember the positive."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"I love how it‚Äôs not a time travel movie where we go back to the past, but other humans from another world. It‚Äôs interesting that they consider Dinos to be ‚Äúaliens‚Äù when we consider them as past life."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,It looks very cool.<br><br>I love that Sony brings out new original sci-fi movies every year.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-31,"Never expected to see Adam Driver in a movie like this, but here we are. Definitely gonna watch"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-03-29,"When he first crashed, I was so waiting for Yoda to be there."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"This came out of nowhere, but Adam Driver and Dinosaurs? Im 100% here for it"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-19,"Adam &quot;Bury the past, kill it if you have to&quot; Driver, taking that to the next level"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,The fact that Adam was a Marine before acting makes him the best possible choice for a soldier type character. Super excited to see him in action. üôå
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-04-12,Recently completed watching this movie.<br><br>- Great PLOT.<br>- Recommended to slow watchers.<br>- No great Hold in story.<br>- Ending not as expected.<br>- Actor done there Job great.<br>- If Writing and directing end part was had good holding THIS MIGHT BE A NOMINEE.<br><br>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS!<br>THIS ARE JUST MY VIEWS**
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"The sheer levels of hype I feel for this right now! Finally, finally someone saw sense and made an actual Dinosaur horror based movie! Also, real Turok vibes here man!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-16,"This looks AMAZING ‚Ä¶. Love the story line already . Dino‚Äôs , not Jurassic park , space aliens 65 million years ago ‚Ä¶ this movie seems like a breath of fresh air ‚Ä¶"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"That Dinosaur reveal with a lightning flash behind the protagonists was a really cool one. When they were looking at the dark cave and the camera kept after them as they stepped backward, I was like &quot;it&#39;s behind them isn&#39;t it?&quot;"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-07-08,"really good movie this, and for my fellow boomers the girl in this is the daughter of the guy who had amnesia in &quot;freddy&#39;s death, the final nightmare&quot;. and that girl is doing great, she&#39;s booked for many movies, so i&#39;m sure her dad is very proud."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,It‚Äôs like a blend of every sci-fi action movie ever made
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,Adam driver never fails to surprise us ü•∂
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-21,Adam driver is a phenomenal actor! I can‚Äôt wait to see this just because of his role in it.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-04-29,"Really good movie. It‚Äôs Outlander (2009) meets the Last of Us. The over reaching story is much more visceral than just surviving dinosaurs and an inbound, planet killing asteroid. No woke or political messaging, just a solid tale about survival and coping with personal tragedy."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-01-11,Definitely need more dino movies with the horror element this film looks to have.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,Not gonna lie this looks really good and I‚Äôm excited to see an original movie for once and not a sequel in theaters
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-17,I love how they kept the details of this movie a secret for years then this trailer came out and it was different from what everyone anticipated. I‚Äôm 100% sure there‚Äôs a lot more surprises and thrills in the actual film than what they already revealed in the trailer which makes it even more exciting to watch. Clever move! I hope they drop a 2nd trailer soon.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-11-23,I ended up LOVING this movie! Adam Driver should do &quot;Tunnel in the Sky&quot;!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,65 is what you get when you combine Pitch Black and Jurassic Park and I&#39;m here for it.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-17,We need more creative movies like this! So sick of today&#39;s Hollywood. THIS IS NEEDED!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,I am so hyped! We haven‚Äôt had a big budget dinosaur film that‚Äôs not Jurassic World in forever!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-03-28,Keep hitting home runs Sony!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,I&#39;m all for a bonkers sci-fi survival film with dinosaurs! Definitely seeing this on the big screen.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"Adam Driver looks like he‚Äôs gonna be <i>amazing</i> in this, and I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of Ripley and Newt (from ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù) seeing him and the bond his character‚Äôs developing with this little girl. Plus, it‚Äôs refreshing to see another dinosaur flick come along that <i>isn‚Äôt</i> ‚ÄúJurassic (even though I am a big ‚ÄúJurassic‚Äù franchise fan).‚Äù üëç"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,I absolutely love that Adam Driver is playing this role. This movie is gonna be great
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-05-13,This movie was awesome I was drinking a 6-pack of corona beer and eating 3 pounds of crawfish with rice watching this movie
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,This looks really good
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-19,"This looks one of those films that could be mediocre yet still incredibly fun to watch. I think it looks great, I love the concept."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,So keen to see Adam in this genre. Hope it doesn&#39;t disappoint.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-12-18,Can‚Äôt believe people saying it‚Äôs trash I‚Äôm just about to watch it üò≠
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-02-16,Man I&#39;ve been wanting to see a horror style movie involving dinosaurs for SO long. The overall concept and setting seems great. I can&#39;t wait to see this.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,Yes! More movies with magnificent Adam driver. I absolutely love him and everything. He carried the Star Wars sequels
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Big Turok vibes from this one. Hopefully theres more Dino enemies then just the standard Raptor and Rex. There‚Äôs so much potential!<br><br>I went back and looked at the different creatures shown off. Looks like there‚Äôs a semi aquatic creature, a Rex, raptors, and an unknown theropod at around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXejJq5vr0&amp;t=118"">1:58</a>.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a Rex cause it has long front arms that don‚Äôt match the later shots of the Rex. So it looks like there‚Äôs gonna be the basic spread of having a small, medium, and large carnivore. Definitely interested to see what species they name drop<br><br>Someone in the comments has a great eye and caught that the Dino is different then the raptors at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXejJq5vr0&amp;t=147"">2:27</a>. It‚Äôs feet don‚Äôt have sickle claws and in the full body shot it looks like there‚Äôs a beak and a head crest. There‚Äôs gonna be Oviraptors!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2025-01-06,"This was my first movie so i didnt know anybetter,  10./10  hip hip horay!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,That fact that Sam Raimi is helping make this movie got me hyped I really wanna see some new horror elements for this
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"I suppose I‚Äôm in, we rarely get fresh movies free from existing franchises or remakes these days so this is a breath of fresh air<br>Also I‚Äôm glad Adam is in it he‚Äôs pretty talented outside of SW which mostly everyone knows him for<br><br>Also Sam raimi? A quiet place writers? I‚Äôm definitely in"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-02-27,I love Adam driver in military type roles. His real-life experience just brings so much to his acting. It&#39;s phenomenal.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-05-12,Been putting off watching this since last year and decided now to watch it. Just finished  and wow what an amazing film. 10/10 Adam is one amazing actor. I mean we knew this anyway from star wars.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,This looks AWESOME. I didn‚Äôt know creating a good looking dinosaur movie that isn‚Äôt Jurassic Park was possible. Kudos to the CGI department and design team!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-20,"This has SO much potential, cannot wait to see this in theaters! Finally a dinosaur movie that isn&#39;t Jurassic Park..."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-08-08,"several years ago when going through prescription pill detox , actually imagined something similar, went back to prehistoric times through my mind lol , looking forward to seeing this!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,The Turok vibes are strong in this one.. Love it
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Oh my god, this felt refreshing to see. I‚Äôm definitely gonna be watching this once it hits theaters!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"This definitely gives off Predator/Jurassic Park vibes, plus the people who wrote A Quiet Place and director Raimi worked on this with the badass himself, Adam Driver?! I‚Äôm all in! <br>Finally, a movie where pterosaurs are a part of nature vs man, I hope this doesn‚Äôt flop."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2024-09-23,Adam is such a great actor
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"Glad to see Adam Driver as the main character, he&#39;s a really great actor"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,We need some more dystopian scifi films like these. Go Sony!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Man, I&#39;ve been anticipating this movie for quite a long time back when it was announced. And I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that this looked totally different from what I was expecting it to be,other than hearing the rumblings that it involved dinosaurs. Plus, I greatly enjoyed the work of Scott Beck and Bryan Woods from the first A Quiet Place movie, and I want to see what more of their work. Cannot wait to see 65 in action!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-08-31,I don&#39;t know if the movie is good or bad but it did knock me out better than meds. Wow I remember about 30 min. of the movie then it was magically 4 hours later. Think I&#39;ll buy a copy for those hard to rest nights.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,Ive really been appreciating Adam Drivers movies lately.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,Looks pretty cool! Adam Driver is pretty much excellent in everything he does. Hope to see more movies starring him!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,"Finally, the Turok movie I‚Äôve always wanted."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-07-24,This movie was way better than the last couple of Jurassic park movies that came out
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,If this lives up to its expectations we definitely going to have a franchise
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,This is the closest thing to a Turok movie we‚Äôre going to get and I‚Äôm ALL for it
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,Finally Adam Driver will be in a good Sci Fi movie. Much deserved great actor.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-09-01,"Watched this last night &amp; knew NOTHING about it. I suggest that‚Äôs the best way to go in. I was shocked when I figured out where he landed. Great movie, thank you!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Finally a new Dinosaur movie that is a Jurassic Movie, I‚Äôm a huge a fan of Dinosaurs so this gets me very excited"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-19,This actually looks really entertaining. Like a combination of two of my favourite movies. Aliens and Jurassic park. I look forward to seeing it when it releases! üòÄ
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,Film actually looks like it has nuance to it unlike most movies nowadays. Very creative plot and adam driver as the main character in a thriller-horror movie seems like a great idea
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-07-02,"In my school we kept randomly saying 65, and innocent us, didn&#39;t know it was even a movie."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-17,I always loved &quot;precursor race&quot; sci-fi stuff!  The idea that earth wasn&#39;t humans first home is such a fun story to dig into!  I hope they do a good job with it!
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"Sincere props to this trailer&#39;s editor. The reveal of the &quot;65... million years&quot;, VERY well done! Had me hooked immediately!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,"Dang, wasn&#39;t expecting dinosaurs. Kinda was hoping for an actual alien planet but I am very intrigued by the premise and look."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-06-10,"65 is an excellent movie. I really enjoyed this film. It had action, suspense, thrills, jump scares. Beautiful scenery and effects, humor and heart.  The performances by Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt are incredible."
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,Anything with Adam Driver in it is worth watching but Adam + Dinosaurs is something I‚Äôd watch on repeat! I‚Äôve been waiting for so long to watch him in an action movie but this only gets better because not only it‚Äôs an action movie but he‚Äôs also in a soldier type of character! This is maybe the closest we get to seeing his Marine skills.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-15,"This has Pitch Black, Prey and Jurassic World vibes to it, and I&#39;m all in!"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2023-10-21,Damn when I was 9 I went to go see this movie with my dad and now I‚Äôm 10 and a still remember this movie
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,"The part where he said, &quot;Send Help.&quot; Nailed it for me. Excited"
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-18,Adam Driver deserves this. Can‚Äôt wait. Looks good already.
65,bHXejJq5vr0,2022-12-14,Man a movie like this with Adam Driver as the lead looks amazing. Can‚Äôt wait for this one
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,"Potential is off the charts.  If youre an old timer like me, you remember growing up with horror movies coming out on VHS based on every holiday possible, and this oozes that same nostaligic vibe.  The cinematography looks spot on and I&#39;m already in 100%."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,"No cap, the kill where he shoved the utensils through the ears left me physically flinching because that is probably the one injury I fear the most."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-26,the idea of each kill being themed around it&#39;s own thanksgiving dinner appliance is honestly so creative
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-06-16,After seeing the movie i can tell this was the most brutal killer i&#39;ve seen in a slasher movie for a long time
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,"Now this is the <b>real</b> theatrical trailer for Eli Roth&#39;s Thanksgiving.  Thanks, TriStar Pictures.  It&#39;s the movie studio that brought you Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,I can&#39;t believe it took 15 years for this Grindhouse standout to get made but I&#39;m here for it. This looks awesome!!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,Every slasher fan is going to love a movie with inventive kills and at least one good chase scene and this looks like it is going to deliver big time!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,This was intense
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,FINALLY A THANKSGIVING MOVIE
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-27,"I can&#39;t believe they made a whole holiday based on this movie, that&#39;s awesome."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-02-22,the Black Friday scene is one of the best horror-comedy scenes i&#39;ve ever seen -- i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever laughed so hard
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-17,Just got out of the theater. This movie was excellent. No filler and some of the ways the characters were killed off were absolutely brutal. Very unexpected ending. I totally recommend.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,Eli Roth is a true student of the horror genre! Very high hopes this becomes a staple slasher film!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,Y‚Äôall killin it with these trailers. Thanks for giving me something to watch for November!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-03-12,"Watched in the theater alone, last december. It was a nice, entertaining experience. I hope there will be a sequel!"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,We need more good Thanksgiving movies like this one.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,So basically like a Halloween movie but it revolves around Thanksgiving. I like it!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,This trailer looks amazing can‚Äôt wait to see this movie
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-04,"This looks fantastic. And what I love is that it seems to take itself seriously- meaning it&#39;s just the right level of camp without being absurd or trying to be a comedy. Too many slashers are comedic these days, but I love how violent, dark and nasty this one is."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,"This time, the trailer isn&#39;t a fake, it&#39;s a real thing."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-12-01,"Amazing movie! Took myself on a date twice to see it last week and I was left smiling each time. Eli completely captured 80s and 90s camp horror and made it his own. Definitely a cult classic horror. Hopefully there will be a trilogy franchise because a movie each ‚Äúthanksgiving‚Äù (I‚Äôm Native American, we call it turkey day) would be epic üò©ü•π"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-04-20,"It&#39;s heartening to know that they can still make such movies with so much power in it. Good acting, impressive direction, classic screenplay &amp; a brilliant story. This one will go down as a horror classic in a few decades, I feel. You must watch it. Time spent well. <br><b>20 April 2024</b>"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,I will 100% be watching this movie. It‚Äôs been a long time since someone has made something as entertaining as this looks
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,John Carver is instantly the Michael Myers of Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,It‚Äôs so trippy to see that Roth was actually planning on making this all along since the super brutal fake trailer for this film came out in the grindhouse theatrical release. Can‚Äôt tell you how wild it is to see that in theaters 15 years ago when I was around 17 years old and then now‚Ä¶ movies really help make life worth living thanks to all these fantastic directors who aren‚Äôt afraid to push boundaries cinematically
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-12-09,I TOTALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS!!! THE ENDING WAS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED AND IT WAS AN ALL AROUND GREAT MOVIE!!!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbU50SdL8zA&amp;t=147"">2:27</a> I have a feeling Rick Hoffman&#39;s gonna be the killer cause that smile shows that he&#39;s up to something not good."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,"For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, Thanksgiving has a grindhouse trailer from 2007 because it was cancelled that time. I&#39;m glad they finally decide to complete the movie."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-17,Finally a movie that shows what Thanksgiving is really about... MURDER!!!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2025-01-15,I loved how creative and brutal the kills were in this movie. Great modern slasher film.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,I normally don&#39;t want October to end but LETS GOOO NOVEMBER!!!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,"This giving me old 1900s prom night , my bloody Valentine‚Äôs Day, sleep away camp, vibes I love it !"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-19,"Saw it yesterday and it‚Äôs one of the best, most original horror/slasher movies I‚Äôve seen in a long time. It had me completely invested from start to finish with no dull moments really. It‚Äôs a really intense movie that you should unquestionably see in the theatre. I didn‚Äôt watch any trailers or read any reviews before watching the movie, so I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. It‚Äôs not often that I give a movie full stars but this one gets a  5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è rating from me."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-09-15,Biggest fear will be getting stuck in an oven like at the end of the trailer. Great! Now I‚Äôm going to have nightmares after watching this
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-18,"Eli Roth is one twisted dude. You can always count on him to deliver a good, twisted, horror movie."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-06,"Excellent trailer that really keeps your attention.  My only concern is that it, like many other horror movie trailers, show too much.  The scene where the killer uses the water and fridge door is super creative, I wish I could have seen that for the first time in theaters."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-18,This movie was so goood . Better than the last Halloween movie üçø
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-11-16,"I think that this movie is one Eli Roth&#39;s best movies of all time! Next to Cabin Fever, Hostel, Knock Knock, and Green Inferno."

Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-03-04,Ngl when he put that ladies face and hands on that cold freezer and made her skin freeze off‚Ä¶that was mad creative but crazyüò≠üò≠üò≠
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-29,"I saw this trailer in theaters, and honestly my first reaction was how trapping a person by freezing their face to the freezer wall was so creative"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-06,Just having Rick Hoffman in this film makes me want to see it. He never disappoints.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-08-11,"Reminded me of the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE! Very similar story. In a small town, holiday oriented and a really pissed off killer on the loose! Looks great! Can‚Äôt wait to watch it. ü¶É"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,Oh my!  This was intense.  Eli Roth is back!   I like the fact that he is giving us just enough to wet our horror appetites.  This movie is going to be brutal..  Great job with this trailer!

Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,This film gives me chills
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-12-06,Just got out of the cinema with my husband after watching this. It was better than I thought it would be and the twist of who the killer was definitely was unexpected. Recommend üëçüèæ
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-05,I appreciate that this horror movie has the killer utilizing the Thanksgiving holiday as part of his inventive kills! It takes advantage of the holiday horror aspect! I‚Äôm sold! ü¶É
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-02,I&#39;ve been waiting ages for them to actually make that one trailer into a movie. Looks like it might&#39;ve been worth the wait
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-06,"If this turns out to be a good movie, this could be added to my list of holiday movies to watch on the day of the holiday"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-06-10,Probably best slasher flick of the generation. Modern Gen Z with classic slasher/horror influence and honored. I‚Äôve watched it twice
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-09,Finally a historically accurate Thanksgiving movie
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-09,"This is actually giving me bloody valentine vibes, with a tragedy related to the holiday, and a town where the holiday is integral to."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-17,"If you love horror like I do and nothing nowadays seems to scare you in that amazingly fantastic way you love to be scared, watch this movie!! I just saw it and I&#39;ve never felt the impulse to walk out on a horror movie within the first five minutes because it was THAT kind of horrifying before Thanksgiving."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-11-09,"<b>It&#39;s so bad it&#39;s funny lmao üòÖü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£! If you have time to kill, and if you&#39;re bored, you can watch this.</b>"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-05,So great that they recognized this hobby and for once point out the horrors that Black Friday and commercialism point out in our real life
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-06,"It&#39;s been a 16 year wait! Seriously hope it was worth it. ‚ù§‚Äçüî•ü§ûüèΩ<br><br>Also S/O to Tim Dillon, congrats on the role. üëèüèΩ‚ù§"

Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-17,"We got Halloween and now Thanksgiving, all we need is Christmas."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-11-19,"The fact that the Black Friday scene wasn&#39;t even exaggerated. Even my mom told me that it&#39;s chaotic in person, so we participate online instead. üò¨"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,You can just tell this is going to be so good
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-07,This is like comfort food for horror fans especially those who love slashers of the 80s. I&#39;m all for it.
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-04,You have to admire the creativity this killer is showing.<br>This might be a good horror movie.

Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-12-20,"This was awesome. Like, I didn&#39;t know what to expect really. I watched the movie today and I really enjoyed it, I bought it on iTunes and watched it. I haven&#39;t actually watched any of the full trailers for it tbh till now lol, and this was really good. I&#39;ve seen bits of the movie from TV spots but this was awesome. And each kill was unique I think, and the reveal at the end was something I didn&#39;t expect."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-08-14,"The wordplay on this movie was genius! I was cracking up! This is like watching, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween &amp; Final Destination. It was really easy to figure out who the bad guy was. I enjoyed it. Then again, I am that person who finds the humor in horror films &amp; laughs in the theater. I did lose it when they brought the step mom out of the oven! The extra touches on that scene had me in tears with laughter."
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-12-14,"It was fantastic, we need part two inmediately ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-10-14,"Please let the bad guy win, I don&#39;t want this to be another &quot;oh look the lead character wins again&quot;"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2023-11-18,Saw it last night with some friends and it was really fun with so many great kill scenes. It made me want a future Final Destination movie to be directed by Eli Roth. Could you imagine the death sequences in that!
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-08-22,"Eli Roth has honestly never let me down with solid, creative and gore filled horror films. Still remember going to the midnight releases of both Hostel films in the 2000‚Äôs and they‚Äôre still some of the most enjoyable horror films for the pure gore in my opinion. This was such a fun watch and it‚Äôll now be an annual watch for me on Thanksgiving just like Krampus is on Christmas and Trick r Treat on Halloween. Thanks for the nostalgia Eli!"
Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-11-03,"You‚Äôve made it through Halloween, now try and survive Thanksgiving."

Thanksgiving,KbU50SdL8zA,2024-07-13,Just watched. Fun slasher. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt watch it on Thanksgiving. That would have made it even more fun.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-05-19,"AAAAAAAAAAAAA, I can&#39;t wait. Serbian culture is heavily influenced by our Greek brothers. Jaja with picking chickens for dinner, brings me back to my childhood. We eat meat! :)"
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-05-12,I need this wholesome content in this cold world. One of the most natural cast chemistries I‚Äôve ever seen. Love it ‚ù§
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-08-15,I just watched the first two movies. They were great!

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2024-04-20,I love how they have one of the best greek Eurovision songs ever in it! Opa!
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-08-25,"Probably the only franchise that actually gets consistently better with each movie. The first is a super cliche mildly funny romp with ok acting. The 2nd is actually really well acted, very heartfelt, and significantly more funny. And this one looks beautiful, charming, and introduces a ton of new plot courses. It‚Äôs also kinda nice they‚Äôre moving past the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm embarrassed I‚Äôm Greek‚Äù as this looks to be the perfect blend of poking fun at Greek tropes and wearing it proudly. I‚Äôm actually so excited"
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-05-12,I&#39;m glad this movie that taught me about Greek family customs and a sense of togetherness is finally back

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-08-30,"I love these films, having watched and bought the first 2 this is a great surprise as I had no idea. The films and cast are brilliant, so full of comedy that gives you such a good laugh which we all need nowadays.  Xx"

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,AAflXqZ5xs0,2023-09-05,"We Italians can relate unbelievably!  The family, the foods, the traditions, &amp; the positively gorgeous countries we hail from.. <br>My cousin is half Greek &amp; she lives there still!  She‚Äôs always loved it there.. can‚Äôt say I blame her if I had relatives in Italy I‚Äôd be living there!  But I digress, <br>The original was just such a feel good movie that you could get lost in with laughter!  The second cos√¨ cos√¨‚Ä¶ This one looks promising though.. <br>HOPA! ü´∞üèΩ üá¨üá∑"

Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Wes Anderson&#39;s style is so distinctive that one can tell from the thumbnail it&#39;s his film. <br>I am glad we have like entire hollywood in this.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"Just when you don&#39;t think it can get more Wes Anderson, it gets more Wes Anderson."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-13,I love that Wes Anderson continues to use his friends over and over in his films. Watching his filmography is like watching all these actors grow up or grow old. i think its beautiful.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,This just goes to show how respected  Wes Anderson is in the industry that he can get that line up for one film.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Imagine your movie being so stacked that you forgot to add Margot Robbie and Edward Norton in the trailer
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-21,"Wes always nails one thing:  The mundane awkwardness of a normal conversation.  In a way, I think everything about his style of filming (the angles, pacing, color palate) is built around setting the tone for these moments.  We see and feel the uncertainty of one spoken word to the next, and we smile, as we see ourselves."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,it&#39;s crazy how he always take the actors on his world and made them look like they were always from there
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,"Just wanna say, as somebody who works at Kodak, I&#39;m so thrilled to see Wes using our film!!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-22,"My favourite thing about Wes Anderson films is despite the whimsical, almost childlike nature of their aesthetic there is a dark melancholy that permeates throughout the story. Really makes the buttoned down emotions of his characters sing"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-02,I&#39;m not the biggest Wes Anderson fan but I love the fact that he&#39;s continuing to evolve his style. Would love to see what his movies look like in another 20 years.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Looks out of this world.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-19,"I have seen every one of Wes Anderson&#39;s films, and he never disappoints.  They are truly bizarre, but in an enjoyable, likable way.  The sets, colors, dialogue, camera angles....brilliant and unique.  There is a REASON every big Hollywood name wants to be in his movies!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,"God I love Wes Anderon&#39;s style so much.  One of the true artistic voices out there along with Tarantino and a few others.  You just feel it in your bones that it&#39;s them when you watch a trailer, before even a few seconds have gone by."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"This cast is a thousand times impressive and better than the one in Amsterdam did a year ago, and another because it&#39;s Wes Anderson, what did you expect?"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-03,More whimsical nostalgia where children behave like adults and adults behave like children framed symmetrically with a primary color palette. ‚ô•
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,This is exactly how I wanted this movie to look
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-03,I swear Wes Anderson‚Äôs movies just keep getting more Wes Andersony
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-29,That city looks like what people thought a &quot;Utopian society&quot; would look like in the 1950s. It looks like a game design
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-03,"I turned it off halfway through. Not because I disliked it, but because I am beyond excited and want to keep it as alive and new as possible for my first viewing."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-31,"&quot;Im a widower, but dont tell my kids&quot;<br><br>Has to be the best line of dialogue ive ever heard."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Every scene is like an arthouse photo from the mid 50s.<br><br>I cant wait.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-01,When there is a whole pack of Hollywood stars in a movie yet everyone is talking about the Director you know that&#39;s a living legend right there.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-28,I love how evert actor to ever exist is in this movie
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,My favorite part about Wes‚Äô movies is how well he knows and uses his actors. That last scene with Jason Schwartzman was hilarious.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-31,Jason looks great in this. Very different character to most he‚Äôs played. CANT WAIT to see this in theatres. Such a brilliant cast. And huge! So many amazing talents. Probably the largest known cast he‚Äôs ever worked with
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-08,Anderson extract the full essence of each actor... like squeezing oranges!<br>He is an artists!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Oscar for best production design confirmed
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"If I had a gazillion money, I would pay wes anderson to recreate all the iconic movies like aliens, titanic, fight club, the exorcist, jurassic park, harry potter, matrix, etc. just to see his version of them. That would be a blast. Lol."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2024-03-24,I love the <b>solarized look</b> of the daylight exteriors..... <br>That alone would intrigue were not for the actors <b>&amp;</b><br>fascinating story and exceptional cinematography!!<br><i>You had me at &#39;Wes Anderson&quot;.</i>
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-22,Shouted to the high heavens when I heard my late Grandfather&#39;s song &#39;Freight Train&#39; was chosen for this trailer! Makes me even more excited to watch this (inevitable) masterpiece.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-31,Wes Anderson‚Äôs the only artist we go crazy for as his films become more and more like instagram filters
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-29,This is the best Wes Anderson AI trailer yet!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,The whole movie is a postcard. Amazing.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-23,"14 year old Wes Anderson fan here! I&#39;ve seen all of his movies multiple times, and I can&#39;t even begin to explain how excited I am for this one. My dad introduced me to Wes Anderson when I was still pretty young, and since then I&#39;ve really grown to love his movies. Moonrise kingdom is literally my fav movie of all time, closely followed by The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Royal Tenenbaums. I also LOVE Fantastic Mr. Fox. Okay I just love all his movies. Anyways I&#39;m super excited to see this one!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-12-19,"This is one hell of a vibey movie. The colors and lighting are flawless, and the 50&#39;s small town desert aesthetic is, in typical Wes Anderson fashion, dreamlike."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-31,"Scarlett just looks ridiculously beautiful.  Plus she&#39;s always amazing playing slightly detached, aloof characters - which is basically everyone in a Wes Anderson film."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,"Half way through the trailer I actually had to force myself from watching any further. I already know I&#39;m gonna love this film. Wes Anderson movies are always such a visual treat! Can&#39;t wait to see this in the theater, huge fan."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-28,Holy Toledo. I love that saying.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,‚ÄúHow Wes Anderson would you like this film to be?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-11,"As a graphic designer, I can say the color grading of this film is such a pure masterpiece! Kudos to the team."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-15,"I&#39;m not surprised that audience reviews are so low. They have been trained with junk food all their lives.  I am also not surprised that there are so many famous actors in this movie since they have been forced into performing for most of their careers into high profit junk food movies and just jump at the opportunity to do something creative and outside the box.  They are, after all, artists.  I loved this movie.  It was an artistic masterpiece.  I have literally fallen asleep taking my kids to the cinema in yet another iteration of Transformers but this movie kept me awake just waiting to see what would happen next. With most movies nowadays, I feel like I&#39;m watching the same dozen or so scripted stuff, rehashed, again and again.  Such a breath of fresh air!!!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-11,Words cannot describe the excitement pulsating through my chest right now. This is the type of movie that you pause at every frame to absorb as many details as your eyeballs will allow.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-07,I bet so many well-known actors are just excitedly waiting for Wes Anderson to call them and ask them to be in his next movie. They always look so fun to act in.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-02,This! and a Christopher Nolan movie in the same season. Finally a reason to be excited about movies again!!!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,We simply need a chain of Wes Anderson theaters - showing all his movies every day of the week. üé•
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Is this trailer hinting that Margot Robbie and Edward Norton are going to be the aliens?
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-08-08,"I don&#39;t care for some of Wes Anderson&#39;s films, but his taste in songs is almost good as mine. I wonder how many nights he snuck into my records collection at night."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-06,I love the filter they add on all of their movies. It adds a cool effect like a retro summer or something. Love it
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,"I love Wes Anderson&#39;s style, it is so satisfying and distinctive from anything else."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-10,"I am a Wes Anderson fan. He never made a bad movie (my favorite of his movies is The Royal Tenenbaums) and honestly, this movie looks enjoyable. I might want to watch it at the theater when it comes out"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-02,I love how you know it‚Äôs Wes Anderson before the trailer even says it. Such a genius filmmaker
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-02,"This screams Wes Anderson and I love it. What an amazing cast, can&#39;t wait to watch this!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-12-13,Mr anderson onviously is trying to recreate the childhood he sorely misses. His reminiscent style reminds us all of our past and the great times we spent. A truly magical director with his finger on the pulse of melancholy and drama
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-01,i just watched this.  it was a LOT weirder than the trailer tells you.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,"Jason Schwartzman hasn&#39;t been a lead in a Wes Anderson movie since The Darjeeling Limited, cool to see him playing a new kind of character for him."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,It literally took me one second to realize this was a Wes Anderson picture...
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-08-11,Can&#39;t say I&#39;m a fan o/this movie. 45min in &amp; the boredom is overwhelming.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs only a couple months away, very hyped!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"Wes Anderson once again demonstrates his ability to wrangle half of Hollywood into one of his films. It won&#39;t be long before he makes an ensemble equivalent to that of Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer, Robert Altman&#39;s Gosford Park and Charlie Kaufman&#39;s Synecdoche, New York combined."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-14,I&#39;m just going to watch this trailer on repeat in a dark room for 2 hours.... sold.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-03,"Man, Tilda Swinton truly is one of the greatest method actors of all time. She nailed it as one of the little girls."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"I‚Äôm so happy to see ‚ÄòGabe‚Äô from Eighth Grade playing the son of Jason Schwartzman‚Äôs character‚Ä¶ he was fucking fantastic in Eighth Grade and he is perfect for style/world of Wes Anderson. Not to mention he totally reminds me of a young version of Jason Schwartzman, on par with Rushmore, it‚Äôs perfect casting. I think we‚Äôll see him in more of WA movies in the future"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-09,"Grand Budapest hotel being my all time favorite movie , I cannot wait"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Love seeing that Stephen Park is in this. Underrated actor!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-03,Within several seconds watching the trailer I knew this is a Wes Anderson movie. His movies has a unique style of its own you can&#39;t miss.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-02,His best ever. I saw &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; two weekends in a row and I think I&#39;ma do it again with this one!!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-22,This is the first thing I&#39;ve seen in years that I liked. Great job.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,the mechanisms for his dialog and soundtrack/fx stop and go with deadpan acting are just super fun. 10/10.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-08-04,Loved it! Anyone else think Jason was channeling Bob Belcher?!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-01,I thought we&#39;d never get that much sub bass in a Wes film. Dude&#39;s keeping it fresh with every one and that&#39;s why I&#39;m such a fan
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-25,There‚Äôs a very distinctive Wes Anderson silence in-between-things that it‚Äôs hypnotic and addictive. And you‚Äôre constantly cued up for the next line of dialogue. I siesta think I don‚Äôt like it until I‚Äôm watching it and I‚Äôm BOOM back in the wagon.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-23,"Oh, how I wish to see a film that emerges from the collaboration between the unparalleled talents of Wes Anderson and Tim Burton. It would be an absolute dream come true!"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,"There‚Äôs always an excitement to an Anderson Trailer, it‚Äôs feels comforting but slightly jarring but you know it will never disappoint."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-03,"Just like Once Upon A Time In Hollywood in 2019 and Licorice Pizza in 2021/2022, what a perfect summer film to treat us with this year. I can&#39;t wait to watch this in a cinema basked in the heat of the summer air - it is always one of my highlights of a summer to watch a film in the cinema at least once."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-01,"After 35 years of my life, it finally happened!!!! I fell asleep in the cinema for the first time in my life! üòÖ"
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-23,I just fell in love with each and every shot
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,This is the most Wes Anderson trailer for a Wes Anderson movie that was ever Wes Anderson&#39;ed.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-29,Love the color pallette. Definitely needs to be enjoyed on the big screen.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-16,"If you&#39;re just watching the trailer and haven&#39;t seen the film yet, maybe don&#39;t continue reading: <br>I&#39;ve been a huge Wes Anderson fan for such a long time, seen all of his films and have been obsessed with and very much influenced in my own creative work by the way he&#39;s building worlds, characters and stories. With Asteroid City though... I gotta say I thoroughly enjoyed his previous film French Dispatch but this one was a bit of a miss for me. Even though (as always) he has the most incredible cast (where literally every time a new character is introduced my jaw drops), insane set design, amazing dialogue, pacing (I could go on and on...), there was something about it where I just felt like it wasn&#39;t coming together fully as a piece... is that just me or did anyone else feel similarly? Very curious about how people received it."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,Tom Hanks fits into Wes Andersen‚Äôs style more than I expected
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-01,"I love the universes Wes Anderson creates, there&#39;s no evil in them."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-15,I smiled when i saw Tom Hanks. I remember his movie &quot;A Man Named Oto&quot; such a great piece there.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2024-01-06,Awesome compelling epic provocative with a strong message that I hope most people can grasp
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-04-05,I watched every detail of this trailer and I have no clue what it is about but I‚Äôll probably still watch it because seeing quirky pastel famous people uttering random phrases at each other in monotone is still somehow entertaining when Wes Andersen does it.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-05-19,"I love how in the first or second frame, you‚Äôre instantly able to tell it‚Äôs a Wes Anderson film."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-30,Just saw this on the other day and really enjoyed it!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-25,I knew from shot one that it was Wes Anderson. Can&#39;t wait!
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-09-17,Like all Wes Anderson film trailers this is one where I had to read the synopsis after watching but still feel utterly compelled to see it.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-17,"I LOVED this movie. I can&#39;t get enough of it, i adored every second."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-24,"Fantastic movie - saw it a few hours ago. It is very different than you think it&#39;s going to be, but that honestly made it better. He&#39;s a genius."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-14,"I can confirm after watching this yesterday in Finland: This is an exceptionally &quot;Wes Anderson&quot; Wes Anderson movie.<br>I&#39;m somewhat confused, as usual, but liked it very much."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,This looks like Wes turned the mannequins &amp; fake town in the Nevada (nuclear bomb) Test Site from the 1950s into a movie. Love it! üòä
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,It&#39;s like Wes Anderson decided to make a Wes Anderson movie.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-02,I know Billy! His names Brayden and he was an amazing Tin man in the wizard of Oz. Very proud of how far he&#39;s gone as an actor at such a young age
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-07-09,"Visually it looks fantastic, especially the shot at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FXCSXuGTF4&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> and that&#39;s why I&#39;ll be seeing it on the big screen at a beautiful, restored, historic theatre, the Civic, at this years film festival in Auckland, NZ. Jim Jarmusch loves this theatre and always has his films have their Southern Hemisphere premiere there, as there&#39;s no other theatre like it."
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,It&#39;s gotten to a point where even Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson looks like a parody of Wes Anderson.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-26,Loved this movie. Scarjo and Jason deserve Oscars for this one.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-03-30,Finally.  A movie worth going to the theaters for.
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-30,Jason looks so good
Asteroid City,9FXCSXuGTF4,2023-06-20,the cinematography looks incredible
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Magic Mike XXL is one of the greatest road movies ever and the fact that the gang isn&#39;t in this movie (or probably just have a cameo) is criminal.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-13,Every magic mike is a competely different genre
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,This honestly feels like a different movie than Magic Mike like just a random Channing Tatum movie.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-15,Tbh this feels more like a sequel to step up then magic Mike.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Feels like Step Up/Magic Mike. <br><br>Good to see Channing showing us how talented he is on his feet. üéâ
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-31,Imagine if the dancing moose just appears out of nowhere in this movie
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,I love that they have actual dancers from the Magic Mike Live shows in this. Shout out to Patrick Packing.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,"Salma Hyek is gorgeous and such a good actress. There&#39;s passion in everything she does. Channing Tatum, you are a lucky guy for sure. Will absolutely watch this on the big screen."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,"I love how Salma says she is amazed how her career is on fire at her fifties, when she thought it&#39;s going to decline. Girl, you look great for a 55 years old here. Can&#39;t wait for watch it!"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-17,What ? This is far fetched. I liked the humble gritty vibe of the first 2 . Now it‚Äôs a big theater production. Nothing will ever be as raw as Channing dancing to Pony ! That was the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Period
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,"I&#39;m gonna go see this for Salma Hayek. She&#39;s always wanted to do a movie like this, and this is just as much a passion project for her as it is for Channing."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-11,Just saw it today. Very different from the other MM&#39;s (but great). Salma really elevates the film and she and Channing have amazing chemistry. The dance at the beginning is probably the sexiest scene of any Magic Mike movie. ‚ù§
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Not gonna lie. This looks good and I&#39;m here for it!! Missing Matt and Joe though!! And Salma is still a baddie omg!! She&#39;s super humble and hilarious in real life. I wonder if she gonna do her routine from FDTD in this?? Come through girl!!
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-18,All that water making it look like Step Up üòÇ
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,The trilogy we didn‚Äôt know we wanted‚Ä¶ but the trilogy we always needed. ü§ó
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-10,"Channing, it can&#39;t be your last dance... I get the title... Just finished seeing the movie, credits just finished running, lights came up and I&#39;m sitting here leaving a review. Excellent job. The first part of the movie will leave every woman with a fantasy of you. That&#39;s really why women go to see dancers. It&#39;s a fantasy they escape into for a couple hours before they go back to their lives. I really enjoyed the first movie, they definitely stepped up the dancing in the second film, but I think I have a new favorite. I bought the first two movies, will definitely be buying the 3rd installment."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-04,If Step Up and Burlesque had a baby.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-03-06,"I&#39;m in the middle of watching Magic Mike XXL on Netflix right now.  I really like Channing Tatum as an actor and just had a vague memory of the movie.  There are 31 minutes left in the movie and I keep thinking, this movie is BORING.  I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s because I feel so much older than when I watched it the first time.  I&#39;m interested in seeing this Magic Mike Last Dance movie.  I was so excited seeing this trailer because Salma Hayek is in it; LOVE HER!!!  When the trailer started playing Donna Summer&#39;s Last Dance song, I got so excited; LOVE THAT SONG!!!  I read that some reviews say this movie is awful, but I don&#39;t care; I still want to see it."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-06,I don&#39;t care if are 10 MORE of the Magic Mike&#39;s movie...I&#39;m down to watch them...and more than once..so Bring It On Channing  Tatum...whoa Daddy!!!
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-05-19,"This looks fun. I‚Äôm very distracted by how amazing Salma Hayek looks at 56. Not just her body, but her aura-for lack of a better word. <br>I‚Äôm 41 at I‚Äôve been feeling like my best days are behind. I certainly don‚Äôt look like Salma Hayek, but her fire is inspiring."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,The franchise is going to go out with a bang at least
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-13,I searched up this video because I wanna learn the lap dance üíÄ but didn&#39;t realize it&#39;s actually gonna come back
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,So Mike gets Salma Hayek as an upgrade?! Inconceivable!!
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-03-11,Salma Hayek is great actress and so beautiful
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Finally they just making this sequel after second one.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-20,Channing is one of the sexiest men in the world and he‚Äôs so talented. He‚Äôs incredibly gorgeous and a great actor

Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,I&#39;ve never been single and looked forward to Valentine&#39;s Day like this üî•
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,As weird as this might sound my fiancee loved these movies but unfortunately he&#39;s passed away. So I&#39;m gonna have to watch this for him.

Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-12,Sebastian Melo Taveira is insane! What an amazing dancer! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Taking out the originals guys is like when Pitch Perfect took out the Treblemakers. No Matt Bomer!üò≠üò≠üò≠
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-03,I Love Magic Mike&#39;s Last Dance official trailer so much because the choreography is incredible and the storyline is amazing. Also Channing Tatum looks so hot. My heart was fluttering so much. I am so excited to see it. xx‚ô•Ô∏èüíãüòâxx
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Who was wanting it to be<br><br>&quot;STEP UP! the last dance üï∫üíÉ
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-19,Salma Hayek lap dance scene in this clip was great this magic Mike movie just might be a winner
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,The best &amp; most realistic franchise since The Godfather films.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-19,"Just watched it, it is: Magic Mike, Burlesque and Step Up are a throuple, and it made my millenial heart very happy &lt;3"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,"Not what I was expecting this to look like (at all), but I trust Soderbergh &amp; Tatum will deliver an adventure! Definitely missing BDR, though !!!"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-21,"I can not wait to see this one. It is hot hot hot. Love this, &quot;Why does a women feel she has to choose between money and love!&quot;"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Wow amazing ü•∫üò≠üò≠<br>I can‚Äôt wait
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-08,A little disappointed I thought all the cast would be back!! I totally agree this looks like a step up movie
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-17,Just finished the first two movies and came here to watch the trailer
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,Cowabunga! Go on there Man like Magic Mike üëç
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,My girl said this trailer did not grab her at all like the others.. we both said it seem more like an actual Step-Up Sequel than a Magic Mike film.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-12-02,"The final blast from Magic Mike aka Channing Tatum. With added bonuses throughout the movie like Selma Hayek and the dancers from magic mike las vegas, oh yeah, this is gonna be GOOD. I&#39;m looking forward to this movie, and I&#39;m a straight guy! lol"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,Omfg SALMA HAYEK is üî•üî•üòçüòç‚ù§ Can&#39;t wait to see this
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-14,I was about to go to the movie theater and then watched this trailer thx for saving me a trip
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,"Damn even at 56, Salma Hayek makes my mouth water and she&#39;s my moms age üòÖ"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-20,"I liked it. This is due to the success of the real-life live Magic Mike show that is in Las Vegas right now. The quick clips of the guys dancing on the stairs and the hostess dancing are taken straight from the Magic Mike live show for anyone who has seen the show in person or the recorded clips from audience members that have floated around on here. They extrapolated everything and it has culminated in this. Channing and his business partners did it. Now, this is the &quot;what if&quot; Channing&#39;s character, Mike Lane achieved the same thing. Perfect for Valentine&#39;s Day."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,Haven&#39;t seen XXL but I actually loved the first Magic Mike. Sure this film seems to be missing the ensemble but it seems like a neat character dive story into Mike&#39;s life while also having elements of a dance musical. I&#39;m down for this (heh)
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-16,"Ga dang,..Salma Hayek is fiyaaaaaaah üëåüèæüî•üî•üî•"
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-29,It would be interesting if Channing Tatum decided to release all three &quot;Magic Mike&quot; movies on DVD.

Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,This trailer woke me out of a coma.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,"Fantastic! As women are becoming free to pursue men as well, as female lions do, we rid ourselves of burdening brainwashed gender labels, and become free to pursue true mutual real connections with passion and love and where men are also appreciated for their beautiful warrior like aesthetic attractiveness. Love saves the world. Everybody wins."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-23,"I&#39;m just glad I actually got to have a real lap dance from &quot;Taylor Cole&quot; from LaBares, who Tatum&#39;s character was based on in the first movie.  Being a Latina myself, this movie looks awesome!"

Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-03-19,one of the best dancing movies i have ever watched
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-02-10,Saw it last night and WOW! Channing and Salma have amazing chemistry and Channing‚Äôs dance routines in this surpass the first two films. Great end to the series.
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2024-02-11,"For the love of Christ, would you stop showing me this trailer?? I&#39;ve seen this trailer 500 fkin times, enough already! First the trailer was promoting it&#39;s cinematic release, then it played for 6 months while it was in cinemas, and now for another 6 months after being released to HBO Max. I&#39;ve been watching this trailer for 18 months. You&#39;ve done your job, I know the trailer word for word. You succeeded. I&#39;ve never seen a movie promoted harder in my entire life, so please release me from this misery.  Apologies for my harsh and inappropriate anger. Blame Warner Bros, it&#39;s not my fault."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-15,I remember watching magic Mike when I was just a toddler so many great memories sad to see Mike leave üòûüíî

Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-16,The trailer is this hot can&#39;t freaking wait for the film!!! Whoot Whoot!!!
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2024-04-16,"This was the song i was listening to moments before my mom died in her sleep. She was across my dark room laying on her bed. Little did i know that this song, one of our theme songs together would be so meaningful to me for the rest of my life. And in about a few minutes as i was about to sleep, and my boyfriend checked on her, because she was very ill and had dementia- he would tell me that she was no longer breathing. That she had vomited and was lifeless. And i was in shock. At first i thought it was a joke, then i was confused and all that disbelief, anger, and pain rushed in. I still could not accept it. This version of donnas song has to be the most memorable one for me. Up to this day, i still have trouble accepting that shes gone. And this happened on mothers day."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2023-03-06,"This a new movie so i can&#39;t spoil it by saying much of anything.   However, i believe that it would appeal to most men in general but women 100% of course.   The actual &quot;dance theater show&quot; that they were preparing to perform was very long (not just a 5 minute performance but very long) around the end, so you got your waiting and money&#39;s worth indeed."
Magic Mike's Last Dance,pBIGdw-BRxw,2022-11-17,Salma Hayek is coming for that Oscar
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,"You know what would be a really cool twist? I mean, I know the movie is already finished and all, but hear me out. What if‚Ä¶they actually fall for each other? Right? Like, while pretending to be a couple, they find out things about each other that deepens their connection and they end up falling in love. But neither wants to admit it to the other. And then at the end, just when the woman he‚Äôs trying to make jealous comes around and you think he‚Äôs going to go off with her, and Sweeney‚Äôs character is sad‚Ä¶he shows up at her door and is like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one I‚Äôm in love with.‚Äù<br><br>Crazy, I know.

Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-20,"Even the most played-out romantic comedy premise can work with the right actors; Sydney and Glen have such a spark between them, and I can&#39;t wait to see it on screen."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I love the part where Madame Web says &quot;it&#39;s webbing time&quot; and---oh wait wrong trailer
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-01-27,"A lot of old timers here that I have been watching for many years, Dermot Patrick Mulrone whom I LOVE in movies, especially The Thing called Love, such a great movie with Sandra, and many other amazing actors. Rachel Anne Griffiths I have loved for many years as well, especially in Muriel&#39;s Wedding...such an amazing movie.  I didn&#39;t think the movie was starting that great at first, then it grew on me. It really did. The end? BEST ending ever, when they all sing the song. I love to see that in movies, when they are all doing something together, be it singing or dancing. Great cast, great movie. Great actors.‚ù§üéâ‚ù§"
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,Definitely looks like one of the movies of all time.
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-01-16,"I watched this movie tonight. It&#39;s pretty solid considering the fact it&#39;s a romantic comedy. I didn&#39;t expect anything deep or groundbreaking so I wasn&#39;t disappointed. On the contrary, I even had fun. Sydney and Glen have amazing energy, they&#39;re great to look at and the movie was a fresh summer breeze in my dark cold winter days. It doesn&#39;t pretend it&#39;s something it&#39;s not, it&#39;s fun and lighthearted ‚Äî definitely wouldn&#39;t mind seeing it again sometime in the future."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I think it&#39;s genius to have the clip of Sydney and Glenn playfully talking about the trailer at the beginning. It matches perfectly with their characters&#39;s dynamic in the movie!üòÇ
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-27,I‚Äôm gonna predict how this movie ends: the two people who fake being in love actually fall in love.
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I&#39;m kinda excited for this after all the bad toxic romances we got. <br>I like them enough maybe it will fun
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-05-01,It‚Äôs like if the popular kids from high school wrote an enemies to lovers
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,That spider part was actually pretty hilarious üòÇ
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-04-15,I&#39;m really looking forward to it being released in Japan in May!
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I already know why I&#39;m going to see this. I love Sydney
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-22,Why were people bashing this trailer? I actually kinda love it. It&#39;s very early 2000s romcom and it plays to that!
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,"Sydney, Sydney &amp; Sydney, that‚Äôs all one needs to see this."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-28,"This movie actually looks pretty funny lol. The opening bit was good lol, gave me a good chuckle. People say it‚Äôs an unoriginal movie plot and predictable but lol you could say that about most movies. It‚Äôs all about execution. Looks good lol."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,Sydney is such a really good actress. I&#39;m sorry that she&#39;s reduced to her body... But I&#39;m happy for her career !
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-01-30,That‚Äôs the only appropriate reaction when you have a spider in your pants ü§£
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,Two big reasons to watch this movie
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-01-02,"I don&#39;t care if the movie is boring , I am gonna support Sydney .I feel she is a really good actor  when i watched her on euphoria. I want to see more of her."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-17,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjH6Sk7Gxs&amp;t=83"">1:23</a> Sydney rules like everytime"
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-18,I actually was expecting smth way better. This trailer is better than the first one but it&#39;s still cringe and the acting and dialogue seem wooden. I&#39;ll wait to watch it online. They also have ZERO chemistry with each other.
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,"After No Hard Feelings, now this, sounds like rom-coms are making a comeback, it would a good watch for couples on Valentine&#39;s Day, ngl Sidney Sweeney looks pretty hot, and I like Glen Powell&#39;s confidence, even after getting rid of that spider."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-17,I‚Äôm only here because of Nathan Fielder‚Äôs apology. Who would actually go see this in a theater is beyond me. üòÇ
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,Not gonna lie this looks DECENT!!!!.

Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-18,"I need a light romcom like this tbh, LOVE IT!"
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I CANT WAIT!!! I love Sydney!ü´∂üèºü´Ç
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-12-12,I am fangirling for a movie I haven&#39;t even seen yet. The fake dating to actually falling for each other trope is so cute! I am so excited to see this on screen!

Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-01-14,I watched this last night and had dreams all night that i was going on a boat with my work managers singing to Natasha Bedingfields Unwritten. Im going through a strange phase
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I must not be seeing what everyone else is seeing because I always see people talking about how amazing of an actress Sydney Sweeney is but her line delivery sounds so dead in everything I&#39;ve ever seen her in????
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-02-15,"Silver linings playbook is everything this film wishes it could be , not bad for a romcom but just never lands what it‚Äôs trying to do"
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-05-05,Besides the 3 known actors. The rest of the cast couldn&#39;t act.  The hype of this movie was absolutely hilarious.
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-17,this is so much better because you couldn‚Äôt tell what the plot was about in the first trailer
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I love the part where she gave him her shorts.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-02-18,Best scene is when she steals the cookie in the airplane - just hilarious!
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,Well thankfully this looks a lot better than the teaser
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-03-04,I can&#39;t wait to watch this.  I miss the romantic comedies of the early 1990 early  2000s.  They seem to have great chemistry. I love Sydney Sweeney. Who else is excited about this movie?  It&#39;s got that nostalgic feel.
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,I already know why I&#39;m going to watch this üòàüòàüòà
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-02-25,"The worst movie I have seen in a loooong while. If this is our concept of love and comedy, we are lost. I really regret that I&#39;ve spent money buying tickets."

Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-04-23,"I know this is an usual, predictable, and clich√© romcom movie but I enjoyed watching this movie! Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney have a great chemistry in this film."
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-16,This is going to be iconic
Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2024-05-01,Sequel pls!!! üôèüíõAnyone But Them - where Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell attend their exs‚Äô wedding in the movie

Anyone But You,UtjH6Sk7Gxs,2023-11-29,This guy reminds me of a young Matthew McConaughey due to his charisma on screen. I&#39;ve only ever seen him in Top Gun 2 and remembered him from that movie.

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-08,Phil Lord and Chris Miller are killing it once again.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-08,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw&amp;t=113"">1:53</a> the last thing I expected was an assassin Eagle or Hawk üòÇüíÄ"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-13,Finally a talking dog film for the whole family!üòÉ
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2024-08-30,"Hey I just want to say how much I enjoyed this movie. Thank you guys for this wonderful movie. The part in which Reggie started wandering around as a stray really cracked me up, as that&#39;s actually how I feel getting out of a relationship. So free and sky is the limit. I can do anything I want!"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-09-02,My daughter and her date went to see this last night. I asked her if it was good she said yes and it&#39;s funny. I can&#39;t wait for it to comes out on DVD!
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-08,"Finally, a movie about dogs but not only is it still realistic-looking, but it‚Äôs also easy to follow since there‚Äôs a real plot/the dogs don‚Äôt do nothing the whole movie? And they say fuck!?? This is the movie we‚Äôve been waiting for"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-11,Finally a dog movie that breaks the pulling the heart-string mold. Dogs should give pay back! There are some nasty ass people out there.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-03-18,"I wish all the people that abandoned, abused or neglected their pets had terrible karma, but it sadly never happens"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-16,"Border Terriers are pure genius, awesome to see one star in its own movie! This trailer made me laugh more than any comedy I can remember, can&#39;t wait to see it!"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-09-05,Absolutely hilarious. A sit back and chill 9/10 funfest. It&#39;s not looking for awards but you&#39;ll be giggling if you have a silly sense of humour
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-13,This is definitely going to be the perfect family film.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw&amp;t=139"">2:19</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> I love the homage to Balto üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>I&#39;m glad this is the closest thing we&#39;ll get to an R rated Air Buddies/Beverly Hills Chihuahua"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-08,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be alive long enough to see a homeward bound but rated R..

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-06-21,"Lol, I lost it when it he said &quot;tell that gnome your his daddy&quot;. &quot;hello gnome, I&#39;m your father it&#39;s good to finally meet you&quot;"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-09-06,Omg I&#39;ve just finished this and its now my all time favourite dog movie 10/10 well done all involved.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-04-21,"I honestly love how many movie tropes that are in kids movies are being used in R-rated movies. First animation with Sausage Party (2016), then puppets with The Happytime Murders (2018), and now talking animals with this. Wait, does Good Boys (2019) count for this sort of thing?"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-12,"Oh yeah, 2 tickets please. This looks funny AF. This is how I picture what my frenchie thinks when she stares at me or when she&#39;s trying to tell me she&#39;s hungry üòÇüòÇ"

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-03-21,This is going to be for all dogs when they see this at home this is definitely a must-see movieüòÇ

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-09,This is basically Beverly Hills Chihuahua for adults.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-08-23,"My friend and I chose this movie over Blue Beetle. Best decision ever,  We laughed our asses off. I pray this movie makes profits."
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-25,"Finally, somebody made a parody of all those straight to DVD talking dog movies that were everywhere in the 2010s"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-08-19,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw&amp;t=92"">1:32</a> that straight face tho!ü§£ü§£ü§£"

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-09,Homeward Bound III looks awesome üòÇ
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2024-11-26,My favorite dog movie
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-03-09,"My first dog, a pug, got mushrooms once. He tripped for a like an hour and a half barking at <b>everything</b> including his own reflection, then slept the afternoon away. Once he got up, he puked on my grandmother&#39;s new shoes. <br><br>I miss that little dog. RIP Goatboy 2009-2017"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-07-31,I was wondering how a talking animal movie could possibly be rated R - now I get it.
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-08,An R-Rated talking dog live action movie?! Awesome!
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-02-26,"I wish they made animated rated R movies for theater again. But anyway, I‚Äôm gonna watch this."

Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-03-25,"can&#39;t wait to watch both the English and Spanish dub version, this is awesome :D"
Strays,BzwOLKTbCUw,2023-10-18,Love the cast! And the voice actor&#39;s were pretty good.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-20,I rowed for the University of Washington for one year (1986-1987).  It was the most physically demanding thing I ever experienced.  I still have my race jersey;  it symbolizes a &quot;never quit&quot; approach to life for me.  I cannot wait to see this movie!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-26,"As one of Bob Moch&#39;s grandson&#39;s i am incredibly proud to see this incredible, seemingly impossible story come to life on the screen...  My grandfather told me this story many times when I was still a child and the full impact of it never really hit me until I saw this film for the first time.  Again i want to thank Jenn Gibbons of the George Pocock Foundation for finding an advance ticket for me on December 12th.   This story doesnt just tug at the heartstrings... It instills pride in an amazing group of men that beat all of the odds.  I was able to take my adult children to see the film last night and all three of us where moved to tears at almost every moment in the film...   In closing I genuinely hope that everyone is moved as much as I have been..."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-05,"As someone who rows, this trailer gave me chills. I‚Äôve been rowing since the summer before seventh grade and plan on doing it in college. I love rowing with every fiber of my being and love that rowing is getting the recognition it deserves through this movie! The book was incredible and I can‚Äôt wait to see this film!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-27,"My daughter rowed on the coed club team at Clemson University. I read the book soon after she joined the team. What these athletes go through during training and racing is incredible. My daughter&#39;s crews were successful, medaling in 17 races over 8 semesters."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-18,"My Grandfather rowed for UW in the late 20s. The 1929  photo in the front of the book of the team members sawing a large log has my grandfather, Gail W Burleigh, in it.  At Grandpa Burleigh‚Äôs funeral, his 3rd son, said he was most proud of his rowing for UW.  He was a a dry land boy, very poor, but played defensive end for football in high school and a short time for UW.  <br><br>However, he couldn‚Äôt stay in college and had to return to Great Falls to help his single mother pay bills.  He was a husband, father to 4 sons, and a cattle rancher in MT the rest of his life.  He also helped fight the MannGulch fire of 1949 since he owned the Beartooth ranch close to where to smoke jumpers died.   <br>Looking forward to this movie, Susan"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-23,My Father was on the rowing team of the University of Washington during  1940‚Äôs.  I heard how hard they worked and have pictures which showed him with a body builder physique. This movie is a must for me and my family!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-09,Easily one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read in my life. I can‚Äôt wait for the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-19,"Based on a true story. I watched a special done by PBS about these young men and their coach. Remarkable story. They were incredible. All the obstacles that were put in their way yet they still managed to overcome each one. That documentary was fantastic and I still think about it. I had no idea they&#39;d made a movie out of it. The trailer looks good. I hope George Clooney does this story and those who lived it along with their families, justice. I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed when I go see it."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-19,"I rowed for the University of San Diego and still row with friends 40 years later.  I still am friends with the guys I rowed with, it changed my life.  This was an awesome book.  This is a great sport for kids to get into."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,"I was a singles&#39; sculler in one of the very few university programs that offered sculling in the US. While the training is brutal (esp in early spring, we&#39;re talking 5:30 am wake up calls in the freezing cold, followed by the dreaded erg machine), there is something hauntingly beautiful about rowing on the water when all that hard work just comes together. I do miss it."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-24,"I grew up in Seattle and went to the University of Washington, and I loved the book in part for what it told about both during the 1930s.  The book in its organization and presentation almost felt like a screenplay so I‚Äôve been envisioning a movie for nearly a decade.  I‚Äôm disappointed that they didn‚Äôt shoot in Seattle but I‚Äôm hopeful that I‚Äôll like the film."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-24,"As a former high school rower, I&#39;m excited to see the sport highlighted on the global stage.  It was the hardest and most fulfilling thing I ever did, and taught me work ethic and passion for everything I do, even 35 years later."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-25,"Finally, a studio that knows how to make a trailer, with inspiring music and an uplifting story. Who knew?"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-16,"Currently reading the book. As a foreigner and resident near UW, it is amazing to see the background of that era and spirit of crew. Cannot wait to see the movie! Go dawgs!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-26,"It was a great movie!   Loved the entire storyline.  Life has enough real drama without Hollywood having to pump out garbage.  When America was humble, men were resilient, and courage and sacrifice were thought worthy efforts."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-17,I rowed for nearly 30 years competitively and recreationally.  I&#39;m currently on haitus from rowing but it has a deep place in my heart.  I hope to get back in the boat soon.  Loved this book and can&#39;t wait to see the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,My mom went to Roosevelt in the 40s and one of these young men was her teacher. Looking forward to seeing this- Go Dawgs!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-19,As a crew rower this is just amazing. There‚Äôs hardly any movies about crew rowing and this looks like it will be the best one.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-12,"I rowed on my college team.  Played every other sport almost and felt I was in pretty good shape.  Then I tried out for crew.  I was so wrong.  Most physically challenging sport I have ever done and I loved it!! What a great sport to showcase in a movie and an opportunity to tell the story of such an amazing team, their challenges and victory.  ‚ù§‚ù§"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-28,"Cannot wait to see this - the book was amazing... always destined for the big screen, and a group of heroes that are long overdue for their recognition..."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,"Read the book 3 times. The great George Yeoman Pocock said, It&#39;s a great art, is rowing. It&#39;s the finest art their is. It&#39;s a symphony of motion. And when you&#39;re rowing well, why it&#39;s nearing perfection. And when you near perfection, you&#39;re touching the Divine. It touches the you of yous. Which is your soul! Do the book proud George Clooney."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-15,Its great to see more stuff from the 1936 olympics because so many great stories happened during these olympics and is one of the most important historic event that isnt talked about much.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-25,I worked at the Conibear Shellhouse and saw the boat these guys rowed in everyday. Didn‚Äôt understand until I read the book what it meant to see that boat. Stoked to watch this movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,"I rowed for UW in 86-87, and 87-88.  After college I worked at Foster Pepper &amp; Shefelman for Cam Hall.  One of the firm&#39;s partners was coxswain Bob Moch!  I wish he could have seen this...!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-15,This was one of my favorite movies this year. Just a good-old-fashioned inspirational flick. They are very hard to beat!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,The book was a masterpiece! I can‚Äôt wait for the movie
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-09,"As a rower myself who has read the book many times, I can barely explain how excited I am for this movie"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-25,One of the best books I‚Äôve ever read! I hope the movie can do it justice!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-22,As the mother of a son who rowed his heart out and coached his way into dental school and the Air Force i will be first in line for this movie! GO AMERICA!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-22,As a Gonzaga high school rower I went to the west coast to row. I held an American record as well as was in the midst of Trail Blazers in rowing. Best years of my life and the thrill of winning stotesbury along with many other memories. I was given four copies of the book. The sheer ability to never give up is in everyone
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,One of the greatest U.S. Olympic stories ever!!!  Go Huskies!!!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-20,Since I read the book many years ago I always wondered why isn‚Äôt there a movie on this fabulous piece of history - it‚Äôs about time..
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,PBS put out a terrific documentary about these young men.  It is so good and inspiring I bought a streaming version rewatching it at least once a year!  This looks good too!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-25,This is one of my all time favorite books. I‚Äôm so stoked that they‚Äôre making a movie! I just hope they do it justice.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-13,"I‚Äôm older, and just row on my erg. But I loved the feeling of rowing ever since I sat on an old Concept 2 Model C 30 years ago. Rowing was once followed just as much as baseball or football. I hope this reignites that fervor! The book is fantastic!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-13,"I‚Äôm a rower and I can‚Äôt wait for this movie! My entire crew and I are gonna go see it when it comes out! The book nailed the intensity of love and commitment needed in rowing, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how the movie captures it!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-17,"One of the best books I ever read, with an intimate look at how difficult times could be, and how the brave and fearless people of our country rose to meet it.  That it is true makes it all the more special."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-19,"I have a connection to this story in that the central character is from Sequim Washington as was some of my family, and my Dad was a student at the University of Washington during the time of this story. My Dad was always a fan of rowing, too."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-20,&quot;FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER BELIEVED IN YOU.......AS ONE!.........AS ONE!!!&#39;<br><br>made me get up and run through bedroom wall.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-02-04,I will be watching this movie today. I was the Cockswain for St Joseph&#39;s crew team in 1979 - 1981. We then combined schools at the boat house to form the Oakland Strokes team. Alot of early morning practices before school with strength training as well. I am so glad I was a part of it all. Many of memories! ‚ù§
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-07-10,This is the best movie I have seen in years. I am so cynical concerning the ideological fanaticism that is prevalent in modern media. To have had the privilege to enjoy a modern movie free of that toxic addition was simply delightful. Well done to the film makers and thank you.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-21,I have read and re-read that book at least a half-dozen times. Each time I just can‚Äôt put it down. I can‚Äôt wait to see the movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-14,I&#39;m SO excited to see these amazing people portrayed on the big screen.  The trailer gave me chills.  I can&#39;t wait to see the scenes from history that I&#39;ve only imagined come to life on the big screen!

The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-02,"Just watched this movie today, it was fantastic. Highly recommend. Left with a big smile on my face. Such a good way to start the year."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-12,Read the book a couple of years ago. Knew zero about rowing and never cared about it. Now I believe it&#39;s one of the greatest sports out there and I can&#39;t wait to see the movie!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-30,Most emotional and motivational movie I have seen since The King&#39;s Speech. I&#39;ll see it again. I&#39;ll take others.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-17,"I was recruited for and rowed on the udub crew team my freshman year back in 2008/2009. I lasted one year. Never thought I could push my body THAT hard, and I had already been doing crew four years prior to that. The thing that I remember standing out the most was the annual triathlon."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-05,I&#39;ve watched this over 50 times on loop mode. Love it. Can&#39;t wait!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-24,these are the kinds of movies we need nowadays
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-24,I‚Äôm so excited for Callum Turner to  be a lead in this (mainstream) movie! You may have seen him in Fantastic Beast as the brother but I quite like his other lesser known works. Very talented and so excited for his big break !

The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,Can&#39;t wait!  The book was outstanding.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-26,"I rowed while at Hertford College, U of Oxford (college second ‚Äúfun‚Äù crew). Got hooked instantly. Then, haven‚Äôt rowed for thirty years until finally picking up good old C2 (the legendary Model D) during pandemic. I was barely in shape, struggling to break 11 mins 2.5k. Now, after 3 years, almost 5 million meters later and losing 15 lb, I achieved lifetime best of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEA-udzjjQ&amp;t=439"">7:19</a> 2k and routinely go under 20 mins 5k (my UT1 routine) which I didn&#39;t actually manage to do in my twenties. This may not look that impressive for a varsity crew but I am 48, only 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 145lb. <br>Anyway, as a ‚Äúrower‚Äù, Boys in the boat is truly awe-inspiring in the ways that I think only rowers can fully appreciate.  The book is a masterpiece and can&#39;t wait to see this movie THIS afternoonü§©"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,"Dubs and I approve.  Doesn&#39;t hurt that we tailgate with Rantz&#39;s grandson.  :) UW Crew is still dominating today!  Dad was a Husky, I&#39;m a Husky and my daughter is at the UW now. Go Dawgs!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-05-14,The kind of feel good films I love and have been longing to watch for a while now. Strength of character persevering and overcoming obstacles. No whining. Simple and great human values. üôå
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-12,"Those complaining there&#39;s no diversity. This is based on a true story. We value diversity, but we also respect history and truth."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-20,"Excellent Movie!  Exceptional writing, directing, acting, cinematography...I was cheering from my seat!!  We need more movies produced like this one!! Loved every minute!!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-01,"I love true, inspirational stories like this!  It&#39;s amazing what people can accomplish when they are hungry and fighting for their lives!<br>Like the story of the fox and the rabbit; The fox is running for his dinner.  The rabbit is running for his life!<br><br>&quot;A worker‚Äôs appetite works for him because his hunger drives him onward.&quot; -Proverbs 16:26"

The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-12,We got to see this movie tonight as a &quot;Secret Cinema&quot; event and we absolutely LOVED it! I&#39;m going to see it again once it&#39;s released. ‚ù§‚ù§
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-17,"This is an outstanding film that brilliantly captures the world of The Great Depression, rowing and commitment. Set against the 1936 Berlin Olympics, it has the potential to become a future classic akin to &quot;Miracle&quot;. As someone who knew nothing about rowing, I was hooked from start to finish. The storytelling and performances make it a riveting cinematic experience, appealing to both sports enthusiasts and those who love a compelling, emotionally resonant story.

The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-07,Absolutely a heroic story which needs to be seen!  Read the book first before watching the movie!

The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-21,"Una delle storie pi√π autentiche del mondo del canottaggio e dello sport in generale, nel quale si esalta lo spirito e il sacrificio di ragazzi che lottano per un sogno!<br>Ho letto il libro tre anni fa e sto aspettando il film come quando si aspetta un eclissi!üòä"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-08-08,"The boys in the boat is a Commendation on the American spirit! Forging forward during the great depression, pulling together as Americans, as a nation and fighting in one of the darkest times in American history! We rose above. Sometimes when you&#39;re in, the depths of despair is when you find the deepest push to break out and become what you&#39;re meant to be. I love this movie because It&#39;s inspirational, and it shows us that in this time, that is not as difficult as the great depression, we still have it in us to rise together, to fight for all that  we hold true  and to become the  greatest  nation in the world again."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-14,As a UW Alum and walking the same docks these men did years ago while reading the novel...I am so excited for this one.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-14,Thanks to George Clooney we have a wonderful movie: a true story about good human values and triumph over adversity. No woke nonsense.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-31,I‚Äôm teary eyed. I already know I would be bawling when I‚Äôm finally watching.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-19,"I actually row for a top 10 club in the U.S for youth, and I‚Äôm stoked for this movie to come out. Hope they did their research!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,Dubs Up!  Best crew program over the last century.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-21,"My Father-in-Law rowed for the University of Washington Huskies in the early 1970s.<br>He was also in the Naval ROTC. After graduation his active-duty service was as an assistant crew coach at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. His girlfriend was a Washington cheerleader, who he later married. Now in their 70s, they are still rowing in senior competitive events."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,The book absolutely changed my life I cannot wait
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-13,I rowed my coastal for 24hrs solo unsupported and covered 109km with the last 20k in 1hr at an altitude of 6500ft at Carter Lake in Colorado. I am self tought and self coached.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-29,Great book!  Read it on the plane to London when I rowed in the Henley Masters.  Can‚Äôt wait to see it.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-26,Saw it on Chrismas day 2023 !! Amazing &amp; inspiring movie. Welll done Director.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-26,"When you give men responsibility, a passion, a  goal, hard work then you have people staying out of trouble, learning strength and control and teamwork üëç"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-25,"OMG !! I just watched this Movie. It is so Powerful. The Actors all gave Powerful performances, our Australian Joel Edgerton gave the most Powerful Portrayal of Coach Ulbrickson. So proud of Joel. Happy Australia Day 26th January 2024."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-25,"Best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, brilliant work"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-11,One of the best books I ever read! I hope this movie will be able to do justice to this incredible story!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-04,I read the book and it was so good. I can&#39;t wait to see how it is as a movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-03-05,"I&#39;m not a rower -- but I&#39;m a graduate of the University of Washington and incredibly proud of our rowing tradition! Now in the UK, I support Cambridge!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-13,I rowed 4 years for the Rutgers Men&#39;s Heavyweight Crew (RU RAH RAH). So exciting to see this book come to film. Truly a legendary story for a college crew to reach the absolute highest echelons of rowing so quickly.  Badass crew! Nice to see all the other rowers in the comments! Who is ready to hop on an erg??!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-07,I dated a women‚Äôs crew member when she was on a university team. The training and dedication to the sport and her teammates was amazing. I will definitely watch this movie. The fact that I live in Washington state and have followed their rowing crews for decades has nothing to do with my interest. LOL
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-18,"Christmas  - when the Boys In The Boat film officially opens - is in six days. I lucked into a pre-release screening last night and was knocked out, COMPLETELY knocked out. When a book is as good and deeply layered as BITB, the film that often follows doesn&#39;t usually hit those same high notes. This one definitely did and man, I was SO glad. <br>Spoiler alert: there are no space ships or comic book characters in this movie, just fast boats and genuine heroes."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-15,Going to see it tonight! Thank you for making an awesome movie! Make more movies just like this! God bless america!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-16,Greatest book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs about time it got a movie.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-11-12,I literally screamed with joy when I saw the trailer tonight!!!! I am so happy!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-01,"Absolutely inspiring ,beautifully done film .It brings a sense of pride and honor I havent felt in  a lomg while,being born and raised here in Seattle...Always a Husky fan.What a fabulous ,triumphant story"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-19,"In the chapter where the book talks about Washington&#39;s race against Princeton, it describes Carnegie Lake in detail. I kayak in that lake frequently and the description exactly fits what the lake is still like 100 years later. I think that was filmed on location, so I can&#39;t wait to see it. And as a very competitive dragon boat racer, I can identify with the team. I&#39;ll be one of the first people to see it."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-21,"A movie about strong, determined men, sacrificing themselves for the collective good, kissing girls, and eating red meat. I‚Äôm amazed this film was allowed to be made."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-23,Gosh I love rowing. I enjoy watching when I visit England.
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,This was a great book. Hope the movie holds up
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-19,"As a penniless freshman at Rutgers in the early sixties, I washed dishes at the Commons (student cafeteria that was in a WWII &quot;temporary&quot; aircraft hanger) I had no money so I used to eat from the garbage pail - the leftovers from the student teams that were fed there. They fed the football a lot of meat and I got plenty of scraps. But they were chintzy with the rowing teams (varsity and JV). I always groaned when they came in. They ate every scrap. Another night I would go hungry! Guess they worked those guys, certainly more than the lazy football players whom the coaching staff seemed to want to fatten up!!"
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-18,"im not crying, you&#39;re crying.  Go Dawgs."
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-12-26,So reminds me of the days when my son was on the Orange Coast College rowing team.  He was up at 5 and at the boathouse at 6 every.single.morning.  It&#39;s no joke.  GO COAST!
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2023-10-22,I don‚Äôt know anything about rowing but I do know I loved that book. Can‚Äôt wait for the movie .
The Boys in the Boat,dfEA-udzjjQ,2024-01-01,"I‚Äôm shocked, haven‚Äôt seen a trailer like this in years! Perhaps the tide is turning"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"Sofia Coppola movies are often focuses on female gaze, loneliness, girlhood, and womanhood which makes her absolutely perfect to tell this story. As a huge fan of her work, i can&#39;t wait to see this movie. Sofia rarely miss üôå"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-05,"For anyone curious, I believe this film is based on Priscilla&#39;s own memoir, and she approves of this movie. I&#39;m sure at least a few people are wondering if this sort of biopic is still ethical, but this one at least is."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-14,"The tone shift when he said &quot;what do you mean, you don&#39;t like it?&quot;, when he wanted her to change her hair was absolute perfection. Sofia always makes such incredible films, especially centered around the female perspective. I cannot wait ."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-09,"Saw the movie, it was so so so deeply meaningful to see this story being told with such a spotlight as someone who lived a similar experience at 14. We constantly hear stories and see headlines of these rock stars/adult men in music pursuing young teenage girls, and their stories are never told, their names never heard, their feelings never talked about. Thank you for making this."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"This looks SO GOOD. The narrative decision to centre this on Priscilla&#39;s POV (I think it&#39;s based on her autobiography?) is a stroke of genius. I&#39;ve never been much of an Elvis fan, but I&#39;m finding myself genuinely excited to watch this one. I think in Coppola&#39;s hands the humanity of the characters (based on real people) will be far more nuanced &amp; won&#39;t shy away from the darkness in the story. &amp; these actors are absolutely nailing it from what I&#39;ve seen."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,So glad Sofia Coppola is making this. I was scared when I heard a movie about Priscilla was being made that it would end up glamorizing Priscilla‚Äôs life
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Jacob Elordi is shaping up to be a very fine actor
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-04-04,Priscilla is an incredible sophisticated film expertly directed by the very talented Sofia Coppola. The cinematography is amazing and the viewer is provided with so many beautiful scenes. The film is an intimate look into the relationship between the worlds most iconic singer Elvis and his wife Priscilla. It&#39;s like the viewer is in between each sentence that is uttered from the couple. You really feel like your right there experiencing exactly how the relationship was going. Jacob Elordi who plays Elvis does very well in showing both his flaws and his nice qualities. Cailee Spaeny who plays Priscilla is exceptional. She has an incredible presence and throughout the film has many moments where her beautiful face expresses clearly what she feels with no dialogue at all. UNMISSABLE.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-05,"Damn!  We&#39;re actually going to go with the truth of how young the girl was, the massive power imbalance with him being an adult and a growing star and her being a kid of 14?  I am  down with that."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-19,&quot;She&#39;s much more mature than her age. You don&#39;t have to worry about her.&quot;<br><br>You don&#39;t know how many red alarms went off in my head after hearing that.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"&quot;She&#39;s so much more mature than her age&quot; and then it cuts to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBWk6BohVXk&amp;t=33"">00:33</a> with Priscilla not even knowing simple math üòÇ"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-12-20,"Don&#39;t go watching this expecting the character of Elvis to look anything like him..we all knew about his moods but I think very few of us especially those who haven&#39;t read the book by Priscilla which this movie is based on...in fact at one point she looks as younger at the end as she did at the beginning..all in all if you love tragic love stories, this is one..and the Seperate ways lyrics drop in their conversation was a touch of genius."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,That tone shift gave me chills. I think this might be in the same field as Marie Antoinette and The Virgin Su√Øcides.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-23,"It‚Äôs crazy to think Priscilla (or ppl her age) lived in an America that met Elvis and crazier when you think about the fact that she is still alive, she is a piece of history, that really makes me realize on a historic scale the 50¬¥s really weren‚Äôt that long ago but at the same time Elvis died 20 to 30 years before most of us in the comments were born, meaning on a human scale it was a long time ago. Priscilla experienced a time we never knew, only red about in books or seen on tv, that‚Äôs wild to me"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,A24 is always cooking up amazing movies.  I cannot express my excitement for this movie.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-03,She was 14 and he was 24...<br><br>Congrats to Cailee Spaeny for the acting nominations.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,i hope SHE is able to drop the accent after production has finished
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Cailee Spaeny was fantastic in Mare of Easttown. Love Sofia&#39;s work too. Can&#39;t wait!
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"Cailee Spaeny is the definition of A Star Is Born right here. At 26 year old, she just won the Volpi Cup Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and now she&#39;s recieving Oscar buzz for her work in this movie. Absolutely fascinating to hear it, congrats to Cailee. Can&#39;t wait to see this and more stuff she&#39;s going to do in the future, Sofia Coppola couldn&#39;t have pick the right person to play Priscilla üôå"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-12-13,I was the only person in the theater when I went to see this movie at the movie theatre lol
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,Looking forward to seeing this.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,"This is based on Priscilla&#39;s book,  &quot;Elvis and Me&quot; - I&#39;ve read it like 3 times! I can tell that Sophia is doing the book justice.  Can&#39;t wait to see this!"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,All the Elvis fans will be disappointed to know that he wasn&#39;t the best husband.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-03-21,I loved this film so much that I think it should have been a continuation of such films
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"I‚Äôve been waiting for this for so long! I loved Elvis, but it didn‚Äôt feel personal or show the dark side of Elvis, &amp; it barely gave us a glimpse into Elvis &amp; Priscilla‚Äôs relationship. Elvis &amp; Me was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was fascinated by their tumultuous love story. I watched it again after Elvis came out, &amp; realized the film was outdated &amp; needed to be redone. I can‚Äôt wait. What an exciting year for films!"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,A grooming story like no other
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s the fall movie season again!
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-03-21,"Sofia really is a wonderful filmmaker. There&#39;s always an elegance to the way she tells a story. This looks incredible, and I say that as someone kind of tired of Priscilla.üéâ"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Cailee won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival. I am sure she will get a Golden Globe nomination. Hope she gets the Oscar as well.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,I read some passages on a book written by Priscilla Presley about her life. That line about him needing a woman to understand things like that were on that book.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,A movie about other side of the story! Hope there would be the Million Dollar Man song from Lana Del Rey as sound track because it would be so fitting from Priscilla&#39;s perspective.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-11-02,i love how Cailee changes the tone of her voice in this film as Priscilla. such a great actress
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-28,"Priscilla outlived Elvis, Lisa Marie, her grandson, the Memphis mafia and a lot more. <br><br>I never knew how smart she could be.  Sold Elvis Presley enterprise for like a couple hundred billion and retained ownership of 15% of the estate including Graceland. <br><br>Basically she become more wealthy then Elvis ever was and outlived the whole entourage."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"I remember seeing Cailee Spaeny in the underrated movie Bad Times At The El Royale and thinking, &quot;this girl is good, she&#39;s going to be big in the future&quot; yet here she is right now with a Volpi Cup Best Actress trophy in her hand for starring in a Sofia Coppola movie. Fantastic progress for her üëç"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"Sofia really is a wonderful filmmaker. There&#39;s always an elegance to the way she tells a story. This looks incredible, and I say that as someone kind of tired of Priscilla."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-12-30,Yet another incredible film by the brilliant and phenomenal Sofia Coppola. BRAVO!
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-02,After Austin‚Äôs performance as Elvis I just can‚Äôt see anyone else being the king besides Austin and Elvis RIP
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-11,the line &quot; I want to have a life on my own &quot; is such a powerful line that conveys message such as empowerment or something
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"Looks really good, can‚Äôt wait to see it in theaters!"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-07,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBWk6BohVXk&amp;t=58"">0:58</a> i thougth that was from a real footage. Wow nailed it as Elvis."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre finally making a movie with Priscilla‚Äôs perspective. She was groomed and robbed of her girlhood.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,Hope Jacob Elordi can pull this off. So far Austin portrayal of Elvis is the best. I can‚Äôt wait to watch this.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-09,"I&#39;m glad we&#39;re getting more critical perspectives on Elvis in the mainstream.  Personally I love the Kate Bush long &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, which was about Elvis."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-12-26,Cailee is so stunning and looks like she‚Äôs amazing in this!
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,uuuuh!! THE TWIST OF TONE!! <b>YES</b>  go sofia go!! this is exactly what i HOPED it would beüò≠  showing form a young girls perspective how TRULY insane this age gab is. what an absolute creep elvis was.  i LOVE IT!!!! great angle. sofia never lets me down.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Both actors got the voices down. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-12,She s doing what she did with Marie Antoinette‚Ä¶taking iconic historical women and flipping them
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-03-10,Touching. She went through so much pain and neglect. Brilliant movie though.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-07,"‚Ä¶ Well, they tried to make<br>You look broken<br>But not while I&#39;m living<br>&#39;Cause I wanted you to know that<br>I heard what you said<br>While it was raining<br>‚Ä¶ You&#39;re still lovely<br>You were lovely then<br>All that you had to endure<br>I guess nobody noticed it<br>RIP Lisa Marie."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"I think Cailee Spaeny is perfect for the role of Priscilla, I hope she has a chance to win an Oscar for this role!"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,I heard that this movie was based on Priscilla&#39;s book The King and Me... I remember seeing that movie as a kid on tv back in the 80&#39;s. I&#39;m so happy to see it actually be made as a film and by Sofia Coppola. Can&#39;t wait to see this version of the movie.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2025-04-06,"I watched this movie 2 times, and it made me think better of Priscilla. She went thru a lot with Elvis, and she loved him. Much respect to Priscilla!‚ù§ I think FAME is not a good thing. People end up dead before their time."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"istg for anyone comparing jacob elvis and austin elvis please stop. this movie isn&#39;t even about elvis, but focus more on priscilla. <br>i think both actor have their own style on how they portray elvis"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-26,One of my most re-watched trailers this year so excited üò§
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,"I loved all the Sophia Coppola movies I&#39;ve seen. They are as easy to feel and understand as mainstream movies, but unique, special, intimate, deep; without the need to create completely incomprehensible 3 hour film. And I believe that is a very hard thing to do."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2025-04-20,This has just finished on BB2 and I can&#39;t believe that I missed it.x
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,Ok but why do I keep watching this trailer over and over? ‚ù§
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Great shot of Priscilla practicing with Mike Stone
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"Muhammad Ali was friends with Elvis and he married Khalilah Ali when she was 17 and he was 25, they met when she was 10 at her hometown mosque. Gene Kelly married Betsy Blair when she was 17 or so and he was 29, they met when she was 15 at an audition. Why don‚Äôt they get the same backlash on social media?"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-03,"Very interesting film, I saw it and really liked it. <br>It really focuses from Pracilla‚Äôs point of view of course and really digs deep to how young and innocent she was when she first met Elvis. <br>I wonder if that‚Äôs how Elvis really was though."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-08-16,"Sofia/Priscilla : &quot;Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain&#39;t goin&#39; away. &quot; (Elvis Presley)"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,The first movie ive watched from cailee was pacific rim and i love everything about her there and not only that but her beauty too. Cailee is beautiful woman ‚ù§ She deserves to be recognize üëèüëèüëè
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,"I‚Äôve read her book so many times. I loved the 1988 movie. Looks like this one is going more in depth. I love Elvis. I‚Äôve been to Graceland 8 times. Sounds crazy? He was an still is so electrifying. She has a right to tell her story and it‚Äôs one that deserves to be told in the best possible way. He would literally make her walk around the house balancing a book on her head. Would tap her forehead, if she crinkled it. She lived to please him an did whatever he said because she loved him and didn‚Äôt want to lose him. I hate that some are so negative towards Priscilla. She was 14, just setting in a local hangout in Germany. When Currie Grant comes up to her an asked if she liked Elvis Presley? What‚Äôs the odds? It was meant to be. Things were different back then. We‚Äôre talking about 1959. The world has changed"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-02-18,"Memphis 2 April 1963 : Priiscilla Beaulieu showed up in a red Chevrolet Corvair, instead of coming to school driven by Mr or Mrs Presley. She goes a short day at her school from 9 to noon because she only needs one credit for graduation. She proudly showed her new car off to a newsman and said that she was staying with Mr and Mrs Presley in Whitehaven because she wanted to finish school in this country instead of Germany. (for anyone still believing that Elvis ex wife&#39;s side of their story would be reliable)"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Looks good but Austin will always the best at playing Elvis and nobody can argue that !
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-23,"This story is telling exactly how young girl in love feels and how young adolescent man act when not faithful. Movie gives an echo of honesty and simplicity. I adored it was shot from Priscilla&#39;s perspective, filled with quietness, waiting, while he was living all noise and spectacle. In any moment I didn&#39;t see him being represented in any disrespectful manner, in all of his falls we see a human we can also empathize with. Watching this movie is as entering an enchanted fairytale, it has it&#39;s own pace, sort of calming effect, composed with heart wrenching and butterflies moments. Costumes were spectacular, identical to those on original photographs, acting, directing, sound, all of it. Him throwing her suitcase as an ultimatum and her crying on the floor and being sorry for expressing her needs and rights reminded me of some of those fragile and unrepairable but realistic moments. Woman for woman. Thank you Sofia and Priscilla for creating it. üåπ"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-17,"I finally watched the movie and I was expecting to feel something either happy, upset, sad, whatever,  but it was just dull and boring..."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-20,"I was watching saltburn with jacob, then i saw another trailer of a movie of his AND NOW ANOTHER?! This man is cooking something this year, thats a lot of freaking movies in just one year"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,I can‚Äôt wait to see this! I‚Äôve missed Sofia Coppola‚Äôs movies.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-14,"The more I watch this trailer, the more I&#39;m convinced Austin absolutely nailed Elvis."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"Austin Butler looked like young Elvis in his movie, here Jacob Elordi looks like himself with a new haircut."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-06,"Is it just me‚Ä¶ or did Coppola miss a perfect opportunity to cast Elvis and Priscilla‚Äôs granddaughter, Riley, to portray a younger version of her grandmother‚Ä¶ like ‚Äòmake it happen Sofia‚Äô üëè üëè üëè"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-09,"I got to see this last night at the Canadian premier! It has really fantastic direction by Sofia Coppola, definitely the kind of film to linger in your mind after you&#39;ve seen it."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-06,Has to be tough playing Elvis in a movie right after Austin Butler delivered that generational performance.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,Tricky doing this role after someone has just knocked it out of the park recently
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2025-03-20,I like how this movie was supposed to throw Elvis under the bus and no one watched it üòÇ
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"The song in this trailer is My Love for You by ESG, in case anyone else is wondering."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-07,as a younger gen elvis fan. i‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing this movie. my only one concern is the actor playing elvis looks nothing like elvis. the movie might change me mind about that though
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-06,"Lisa Marie said in an email that the script seemed ‚Äúvengeful‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt approve of the tone of this film before she passed. Elvis aside, Priscilla left out a lot of things that would have made her look bad. While they both had affairs and Elvis was obviously far from perfect but neither was Priscilla. Mike Stone her affair partner was himself married and had a pregnant wife. This wasn‚Äôt in the movie. Last year, Priscilla went after her own granddaughter in court to contest the will of Lisa Marie after her passing. Priscilla has shown herself to be a ruthless person. This movie that she was the executive producer of is an example. She also demanded to be buried next to the love of her life (Elvis) in the settlement but she also decided to further bury Elvis with this film."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-09,"See the original movie &quot;Elvis &amp; Me&quot;, the cast did an amazing job.  However, to date, Susan Walters who played Priscilla reminded me of her in so many ways. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this one too."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"The fact that ESG is in the soundtrack is a nice touch, so perhaps this will be told from the perspective of the present or times after &quot;the king&#39;s&quot; reign."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,im kind of excited to see how she tells this story
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,the fact that kaia gerber has dated the two actors who played elvis
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-11-25,Honestly this is a story people have been wanting to know about for a long time. Great director. Love the score to the trailer. Priscilla approves! All looks good. ‚ù§
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-21,"Elvis Presley. One of the all time great American Dreams, from birth, living in a humble shack with no running water or electricity, to the death of his twin brother, to the birth of building St Jude&#39;s Hospital, to Polio the disease he helped eradicate through vaccine promotion, to the music he fused and arranged with his legendary baritone, to his charisma and stage presence, to breaking segregation apart down South, to the civil rights movement, and to his premature death; he was and is the most LOVED musician that ever lived."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"No way is Butler gonna be topped, but Cailee looks great"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-26,"The problem of coppola is that she took for granted an autopromotion book. She focused on the fact that Priscilla Presley would have been so young when she came to stay in Memphis (Elvis‚Äô father‚Äôs house, not Graceland) ignoring that at the same age Elvis father was already married and Elvis himself was working, starting his artistic career and would very fast become the most famous star in the world. So where‚Äôs the big deal when someone at the same age is living in the neighborhood of her future husband ?"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-01-13,Jacob Elordi is everywhere ‚ù§ <br>He‚Äôs the perfect villain you‚Äôll leve to hate
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"He looks nothing like Elvis. At least Dale Midkiff looked like Elvis. The tv movie they did after Priscilla&#39;s book Elvis &amp; Me came out (the same book this movie is based on) has a young Susan Walters as Priscilla, Dale Midkiff as Elvis, and Hugh Gillin as Col.Tom Parker."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-05,"Like alot of biographies, this looks one-dimensional and highly fictionalized.  Yeah yeah, Elvis bad, Priscilla perfect.  Elvis&#39; womanizing may have been legendary, but so was his generosity, giving away a fortune in his lifetime.  His spiritualism (as well as his sinfulness), if recounted in a movie, would be unbelievable.   An amazing talent with a photographic memory.   A guy who read 10s of thousands of books on philosophy and based his costume on a comic book character.  A very complicated individual.  His love of karate, football, his hollywood and music industry friendships,  his horses, his chimp Scatter, his search for truth, so many untold stories, but instead another story about Priscilla dyeing, her hair for a few years.  Its the least of the things people would pay to see detailed in a movie.  In comparison to the last movie, this looks like a hallmark channel movie.  Its been done before.  How about a movie about Elvis and Ann Margaret?  As an Elvis fan, Ill take a pass.   Also, that guy doesn&#39;t look a thing like E."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,"I think this version of the Priscilla and Elvis story will be different. Especially since last year we had Elvis that Austin Butler played and Olivia DeJonge who played Priscilla. I‚Äôm not sure if I should be excited or confused. But, we‚Äôll see."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-03-21,I loved the trailer of the movie. I can&#39;t wait to watch the movie tonight. I called my wife and told her to prepare for the movie. I got advice for this from many of my friends.
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-03,THE QUEEN IS BACK TO CLAIM HER THRONE! üëèüèΩ
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-15,I read that Lisa Marie begged Sophia NOT to make this movie. Don‚Äôt forget these two families were briefly connected by marriage when Lisa Marie married Nicholas Cage (Coppola). Is it payback time?
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-05,"Wonderful! Looks Like Spencer, one of my absolute favorites from 2021."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-11-09,Super ansiosa pela estreia! Pelo trailer j√° d√° para ver que vem muitas emo√ß√µes!!!
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,A24 has been KILLIN&#39; it with movies!!!!üíØüíØüíØüí™üí™üí™
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-12-05,"I would just like to remind everyone that Precilla was said to have made between $2 and $4 million dollars from the box office off of this movie. This doesn&#39;t include fees and money that she got for her memoires of Elvis and Me that the movie is based on that she sold. Nevermind how the movie makes Elvis look. Rest in peace Elvis. You will always be remember for the sensitive, kind, loving man you were. Still the King of rock and roll in 2023."
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2023-10-04,"Maravilloso que no hallan dado permiso para utilizar la m√∫sica de Elvis, se va a retratar al hombre no al artista.  Bravo por coppola"
Priscilla,DBWk6BohVXk,2024-03-21,"Looks like a fantastic movie, I&#39;d love to see it in cinemas in Turkey soon."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-24,"I am now 60 years old. I was 8 or 9 when this book came out and it was so unlike anything else out at the time. No other book talked about periods and all the other important things we girls would go through. Then, when I was in high school, Judy Blume wrote Forever and it changed how I felt about boys/dating as a teen. Loved that movie with Stephanie Zimbalist and so glad they are FINALLY making this movie, and like a lot of you so glad they are keeping the 1970s setting."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"My mom unfortunaely passed away from brain cancer last year but I disctinctly remember her excitedly buying me this book and having me read when I was a kid in the 2000s just as she did in the 70s. I know we would be watching this together if she was still here, so I&#39;m sure I will for her when this comes out."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"The nostalgia üôåüèæ and when they said the infamous ‚ÄúWe must, we must, we must increase our bust‚Äù ü§£ can‚Äôt wait for this"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-03-19,"As a black girl born in the 70s, I was an outcast sometimes because I loved to read. Beverly Clearly, Judy Blume, and Encyclopedia Brown was everything to me. Books kept me out of the bad elements around me."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"Not me getting a midlife crisis realizing suddenly watching this, I&#39;m not the girl in the book now I&#39;m just the mom trying to keep it all together while my daughter starts figuring out life and I&#39;m freaking out..send help"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-16,"I picked up this book in the fifth grade. I had read all the &quot;Fudge&quot; books by Judy Bloom so I just naturally picked up the next one. The confusion on one girls face in my class as to why I (a boy) was reading this book about a girl getting her period (unbeknownst to me) was hilarious. As I am reading I get to THE part and went to my mother and asked, &quot;what&#39;s a period?&quot; Being the kind and gentle woman that she was told me all about puberty and even bought me a book on it. That was quite the education day."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"This Judy Blume book resonated so loudly w me. I was a late ‚Äúblumer‚Äù and everyone else got all of their changes in elementary. I didn‚Äôt until Jr High. I stuffed, lied bc I felt so abnormal! Lol! I‚Äôm now 53, menopausal &amp; ended up getting a breast augmentation. Now, for a young girl who badly wanted to start her cycle, mine has finally ceased 5 yrs ago! And, for wanting breasts that were larger, I wish I could have them removed. We all go through seasons &amp; cycles. It‚Äôs odd how we end up abhorring the very things we thought we wanted so desperately. Someone should write a sequel for all of us ‚ÄúBlumers‚Äù who are now menopausal:)"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,I read this book SO many times in my teens...  It kept me sane during the weirdest point in my life!!  And Rachel McAdams is in it as a bonus!!  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,She&#39;s so talented
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,I remember my fifth grade teacher reading this book aloud in class. We all got excited when it was ‚Äústory time.‚Äù She gave that book life.üòä
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-07,The movie I‚Äôve been waiting on for 40+ years! This book was a right of passage. Judy Blume was my childhood ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"I&#39;m honestly surprised that a movie version of this book doesn&#39;t already exist. But I guess it&#39;s time. LOL I&#39;m here for it. I remember reading this in fifth grade. Such a good book for young girls to read and realize that all the weirdness they are going through is normal. It will definitely be a good film viewing for today&#39;s middle schoolers and for all the millennials, Xillennials and gen-Xers who grew up with the book."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,I&#39;m so glad Rachel McAdams is a part of this!! Love her and this book so much!!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"I remember (many moons ago) when my cycle started...<br>My aunt sent me a care package with a training bra, a box of pads, a box of chocolates, and this book...<br>When my daughter started her period, I did the same for her...<br>I can&#39;t wait to go see this with my sister, my daughter, and my best friend...<br>‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-11,I think every girl I knew in the 70‚Äôs read this book. It was a must have. I‚Äôm now nearing 60 and I‚Äôm so glad they finally made this into a movie.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,I lost track of how many times I read this book while growing up in the 70s. It‚Äôs amazing that it‚Äôs taken this long for it to be made into a movie!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"With everything going crazy in the world, it is such a true delight to see this wonderful book made into a movie. What a wonderful thing to look forward to. Cannot wait to see this!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-20,"I just saw this movie last night. Fans of the book will definitely love this movie. It‚Äôs a charming crowd-pleaser that tackles the complexities of womanhood, religion, and puberty in a respectable manner. One of my favorite movies of the year!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"Dang, about time! My mom, who grew up in the ‚Äò70‚Äôs-80‚Äôs reading this book, and passed it down to me, who grew up in the 90‚Äôs-00‚Äôs. If I have a daughter, I hope to pass it down to her one day, just as my mom did, and to one day share this film with them both. Many emotions üíô"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-20,I‚Äôm 50 and I read this when I was in primary school. My sister &amp; I loved this book. I can‚Äôt wait to see the movie!!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-24,"this book means so much to me. When my mom first showed it to me, she seemed so happy and joyful that i finally got to read it (i was 10 ish maybe younger and im 16 now) and i‚Äôve never ever forgotten that book and how much it impacted me. It not only represents the transition from child to young adult beautifully, but it represents the evolution of a mother daughter relationship as the years go on. People can‚Äôt live forever, but the emotions that come about when i read this book make me feel like i‚Äôll never die. Thank you so much Judy Blume‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,Saw this last night and I cannot remember the last time I saw a movie in a theater that was such a joy to watch. I teared up. And laughed. A lot. Never a dull moment. Planning on taking my mom and sisters to see it together for mother&#39;s day.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,I am SO GLAD Judy Blume is still alive to see this!!  ‚Ä¶ WHY did it take so long??
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"Judy Blume‚Äôs book got me through so much back in the 80s lol<br><br>‚ÄúWe must, we must, we must increase our bust!‚Äù"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-25,The movie does not disappoint. I saw it last night and it&#39;s about as true to the book as it can be. This movie was well done and brought back a lot of memories. I read it when I was 7 and again when I was 12. I&#39;m 35 now and so happy with how they went about it
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-12,"Back in the 70s, this book was life to me. It was so relatable and helped me through the most awkward time in my life. Bless you Judy Blume!!! I cannot count how many times I read this book. üòä"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-17,I am 54 years old and have fond memories of being 12 and reading this book with my 10 year old cousin. I loved it because we were going through it at the same time. It was 1980. Bless youvJudy Bloom for making us young girls feel as normal as we could!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-11,The best read next to the Bible as a Lil Girl for me!! I love this story <br>All her books are AWESOME! <br>Born in the 70&#39;s were the best and my sisters and our friends had the best time ever!! Our children did too! Thank God they experienced our fun before the world changed OUTDOOR FUN üòí<br>The kids nowadays missing out so. Let&#39;s pray for the world. God will hear us all and He knows our struggle.

"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-02-01,"I haven‚Äôt read the book, but thanks to Rachel McAdams I‚Äôm very much looking forward to watching this movie! It‚Äôs so sad that she‚Äôs very rare on the screen since pandemic started. We so much want to see MORE of her! ‚ù§"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-23,I&#39;m a 53 year old woman and read this book in the early 80s as a 12-13yr old.  Have just seen the film at the cinema and what a fabulous film. Very funny but emotional and thought provoking too. Highly recommended.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,i‚Äôd love for them to make more judy blume books into films or a series.. her books feel timeless
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,My mom had me read the book when I was in the 4th grade in 2006. I loved it so much that I read it twice. Until I saw the trailer I didn&#39;t know it was set in the 70&#39;s. It was so relatable that I never even considered the time period. My mom and I can&#39;t wait to see this!!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"The scene towards the end with the male cashier reminds me of the first time I purchased a bra on my own. Out of all the registers in the store only one was open and operated by a male cashier who looked like he was around my age. I had a bunch of sets I had found on a clearance rack for like $2+ each and accepted that if I wanted them I would have to go to that cashier. So I plopped the items up on the counter pretending to busy myself with something just wanting to cash out and the dude was like &quot;oh, that&#39;s a really good deal&quot;. Ha ha ha. Looking back on it all these years later I&#39;m like &quot;I wish I would have known then what I known now&quot;, because me these days would have just totally started making conversation like &quot;yeah, for that price I might as well stock up on a few&quot;, or something like that. All that unnecessary shame."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,So freaking happy! Kelly Fremon Craig did a fantastic job directing The Edge of Seventeen...can&#39;t wait to watch this now
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-29,"We Must, We Must, We Must increase our bust! Whew, memories‚Ä¶ <br>thank you Ms. Blume.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,"Hey as a male....I just saw this movie last night. I loved it, too!  The 70s was my growing-up decade and this movie was like a time machine!  Highly Recommended."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-03-30,I don&#39;t think I have EVER been more excited than I am at this very moment to watch a movie that made a HUGE impact on my childhood! This book has played such an instrumental role in my GenX years!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"Its the OG cassie from Ant-man  actress Abby Ryder Fortson all grown up , so nice to see her again."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-10,"On one hand, I‚Äôm mind-boggled that it took this long to make this classic into a movie and I‚Äôm thrilled that new generations will have a chance to discover this book. Like a lot of 70s and 80s kids, I read my copy of Are You There God to shreds. On the other hand I‚Äôm glad that they waited til now because an earlier version would have gone in too hard on the ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù of the topic and probably been painful to watch, and this looks like it has a much lighter touch. I‚Äôm looking forward to it."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,"Judy Blume and Beverly Cleary inspired me to read so much. This book, Blubber, Fifteen, Forever, Superfudge, Beezus and Ramona series.....I spent hours locked away reading. I&#39;m 51 and I&#39;ll definitely be going to see this because it is my childhood. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-23,I remember reading this and for the first time a book kept me up all night. It explained what young girls are going through and was very relatable. So happy they are making a movie about it. I think this would be good for young men too as it would help understand how girls go through adolescence.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-14,"I was in junior high in the early 70s when I read this book and it was so great to read something that resonated with my life. The soundtrack alone is going to make me cry, remembering this time period (no pun intended), and how mad I was at my mother when they did the menstruation teaching in school because it seemed like I was the only girl in the room who did not already know what they were talking about, lol. The casting looks great. Can&#39;t wait to see it. This movie is a long time coming and relieved that they kept it 70s."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-13,"I&#39;m not a child of the 70s, born in early 1988, but my mother was and a teen. Man, even just seeing Rachel McAdams playing the mother, truly drives home that time is just a rolling!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-06,this book was such an escape for me as a kid. i still have the copy from that year with the original cover. it&#39;s sacred to me. judy blume is such a master. love her.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-14,"To say I love this book is such an understatement. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go outside as a kid so I read Judy Blume and Beverly Clearly books. Every Friday our class had library and I checked out a new book. I bought my tickets already for the April 19th showing. I‚Äôm almost 46 years old and if this movie hadn‚Äôt come out until I was 86, I would still go to see it. I am SO excited!!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,Omg I never thought I‚Äôd see the day they would make this into a movie! I was obsessed with it as a kid.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-12-13,"Really enjoyed this movie. No propaganda sht, just a simple, coming of age, funny, interesting movie."

"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,I am visually impaired and I‚Äôm very happy that I‚Äôve been seeing comments that say they didn‚Äôt modernize this movie. It honestly wouldn‚Äôt feel the same to me if it was modernized. I used to read this book a lot when I was little so I‚Äôm excited to see how the movie turns out!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-04,I went to see this with my mm yesterday. We both liked it.

Brings back a lot of good childhood memories,  I was an avid reader and loved going to the library and bringing home a stack of books. I will be taking my two middle school  neice&#39;s to see the movie, great coming of age story."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-01,"I recently watched this movie and I have to say I loved it! It felt so well made and genuine compared to some of the movies today that feel cheap and rushed. I think it really helps girls feel seen and stays genuine to the book. All the characters were relatable and warm. Honestly, if you haven&#39;t watched it and you want to watch something truly light-hearted, then this movie is perfect."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-01,"This movie was being filmed on the street of my job in 2021! It was incredible to see the set up, cameras, crew and even saw Kathy bates and Rachel McAdams with all the 70s props. I&#39;d watch them from my window when i had a lunch break and take in all the excitement. Biggest thing I remember was &quot;wow... sooooo many extras!&quot; Lol.  They used  a portion of our building for the catered food and some of the extras (children) gave me a cupcake from their catered food. I didn&#39;t eat it though. I&#39;ve been waiting a long time to finally see the trailer! Looks greatü§ó"

"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-04,OMG Rachel McAdams is playing mum? Where does the time go? It was like yesterday when she played with Ryan in The Notebook as a teenager.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-17,I deeply appreciate that they decided to make it a period (ha!) piece.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"I read this book so many times as a little girl&lt;3<br>I hope the movie gets the recognition it deserves, and not fall through the cracks. Personally I think this is a good story for young girls to enjoy."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-15,"Caught this movie at a screening recently, went in without knowing anything about it or the book. Such a beautiful sweet movie! All the characters are rich and the acting is amazing, but it‚Äôs the deft and subtle storytelling that was the star. Loved it, and recommend everyone to watch it!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-25,Love this is being made to a movie. I read this and other Judy blume books and even read them to my daughters before bed. When I read to them it was supposed to be one chapter every night but they never wanted me to stop. These are my most precious memories. Judy Blume books bring everyone together. <br>I still have the books. They are a little worn but I just can&#39;t throw them away.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-03-17,"I read this book in middle school (either sixth or seventh grade) and did a book report on it (my choice). I identify as nonbinary, but this book still stays with me. It helped so much at the time. Im so happy it&#39;s getting a movie. Im hopefully going to see it with my mom. Thank you Judy Blume üß°"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-02,"I read the book at 12 after I found it at the library. I had just begun to see ‚ÄúFlo‚Äù every month. I graciously passed it on to my younger sister when she turned 12 a year later. As a middle school teacher, several copies were avail le in my classroom library. It was one of the books I had to replace every two years because it was checked out so often. Lots of memories as a teen and adult with this book. Finally, Judy Blume‚Äôs ingenuity will be on display for the world to see. Waiting to see Beverly Cleary and Mildred Taylor books at the theater soon!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-04,I just watched the movie this week and I must say.. This movie deserves to be in the blockbusters list!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-23,"My mom gave me the book when I 13, I didn‚Äôt read it until a year later. But once I finished I absolutely loved it, to this day it‚Äôs one of my favourite books"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"Probably like a lot of people, this was one of the books I reread the most as a kid - it both taught me what a period was and shaped my views on God. I never thought it could be made into a movie because a lot of the story is about periods and I wasn&#39;t sure how that would come across on screen, but this looks good."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2025-03-22,"Judy Blume has a place in my heart ‚ù§ I had her Fudge books and a couple of her other novels in my room growing up, including this one. This one was one of my favorites because I remember a middle school teacher asking me one day what I was reading so I showed her the title and she told me she loves Judy Blume. Present-day, it&#39;s nice to see her movies now. She was a big part of my childhood ‚ù§"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-01,"A friend and I just saw this.  So good. Very funny &amp; heartwarming. She had read the book as a kid, I hadn&#39;t but we both really liked it. <br>I think it is definitely important for young girls. There&#39;s not many movies (or books) that talk about these kinds of things.  It&#39;s surprising still after so many years.<br><br>First thing after I got home I told my siblings that their daughters need to watch it. Either with their friends or as a mother-daughter outing."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,"Omg this book üíóüíó. Brings back 5th grade all over again. It&#39;s great to see all the comments from so many different generations who have loved this book! 5th grade was the early 90s for me. I remember being so confused about what a &quot;sanitary belt&quot; was. Thankfully, I had until 7th grade to figure out I&#39;d be using either pads or tampons lol."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-10,This book is such an important part of my childhood. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this! Judy Blume is amazing.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-20,I read this book and all the other Judy Blume books while I was in elementary school. I read this book and Deenie soo many times. They were passed down from my grandma to my mom to me. I&#39;m so excited to see this!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,"My mom gave me this super complicated sex talk when I was 5 and about five years later, she gave me a copy of this before I could ask any more questions. I think it helped when I started my period at school a year later because I ended up with a huge maxi pad, waddling around school, thinking ‚Äúat least it‚Äôs not a belt contraption ‚Ä¶‚Äù Bless you, Judy Bloom."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-23,"Oh my gosh, I read the book when I was in middle school!! I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôre finally getting a movie for it!!!!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-15,Shout out to Judy Blume for explaining REAL LIFE to kids through her books.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,One of my favorite books!!! Love Judy Blume. Been looking forward to this. Im 32 and I read this when I was 11...read it numerous times since then and love it just as much today.

"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-23,"I love love me some Kathy Bates. I saw her face and instantly clicked. I was an avid book reader growing up. The movie that did it for me is Little Darlings, with Tatum O&#39;Neil and Kristy M Nichols. This one looks like it&#39;s going to be a classic too. Can&#39;t wait.üòªüòªüòª"

"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-30,My all time favorite book. I‚Äôm definitely going to see it. I‚Äôm a 50 year old black woman and I related to this movie
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-12,"Are You There God? It‚Äôs Me Margaret will definitely be a must watch for me in April because of <br>Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates &amp; <br>Abby Ryder Fortson!"
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-05-12,I‚Äôm about to be 28 years old and Judy Blume was literally the best thing that happened to me in my adolescence. This was my FAV book of all time
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-20,"&quot;We must! We must! we must increase our bust!&quot;<br><br>I laughed out loud when I heard and saw them performing that line, as my mother used to do that when she was a young girl growing up in the same time period depicted in this movie."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-27,"Having two daughters, now grown up, it was reassuring to know they were reading Judy Blume books when they were young.  A remarkable inspiring author."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-29,I just watched it in the movie theaters and I can say 100 out of ten definitely worth watching
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-26,This is one my First READS as a YA. And I am STOKED that a movie adaptation is coming out!
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-19,&quot;WE MUST INCREASE OUR BUST&quot;<br>I can never forget that. It made me laugh way too hard üòÇ
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-14,I read this book in the 5th grade and purchased 2-copies for my daughters. It was the highlight of every girl‚Äôs growing up üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-13,"Yes, that hot comb. I remember it well. Finally, a film about actual girls for actual women and girls, about a time when we all knew girls were actual girls. I will definitely be supporting this film. We as women need to make sure that it succeeds at the box office so we can see more films like this for real women and girls."
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-13,Can&#39;t wait!! What girl did not read this book growing up in the 70s-90s?! I still have the hardcover amd softcover books. Its about time!! üëè
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-01-16,Unbelievable that this wasn&#39;t made sooner. Watching this reminded me of what a great story it is.
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",LzRzojHC3iE,2023-04-06,I can‚Äôt wait. Loved all the Judy Blume books as a kid in the 70süíïüëç

The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,"what i love about the exorcist stuff is that demons that posses can snap necks, levitate, throw shit across the room without touching them but they just can&#39;t get out of bed."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-25,"For Russell Crowe to be in an exorcist movie, means that the script was worth it"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,"My son auditioned for the part of the possessed boy. Not only does he look a bit like the one who was cast, but he also behaves exactly like the character at home! He would have been perfect!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-04,Just finished watching the movie! 10/ 10. I recommend that everyone watch it. Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast nailed their roles perfectly!üëåüèΩ
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-05,"&quot;If you have a problem with me, you talk to my boss, the pope&quot; Russel Crowe with his acting experience will take that role to another level. To watch definitely."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-01,"Father Gabriel Amorth was a real life exorcist, he performed thousands of exorcisms during his life and died in 2016 at the age of 91.  He wrote two books, his memoirs.  Not sure if this film is based on those books or even if this film is Vatican approved.  I hope Hollywood has treated this good Priest&#39;s life&#39;s work with the respect and reverence it deserves."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,this is the first time i&#39;ve seen Russell Crowe star in a horror film
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-28,"Movie was very well done, kept you engaged and into it. For Russel Crowe to have an authentic Italian accent, speak Italian very well and everything else that went into the acting and supporting actors shows a lot."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-12,I love that saying at the end. ‚ÄúMy faith does not require defense.‚Äù
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,"I‚Äôm not into horror films, but I think Russell Crowe is an amazing actor and have so far loved everything he‚Äôs been in.  I‚Äôll give this a watch."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-24,Omg how did anyone not cast Russell Crowe in an exorcist horror before now. It‚Äôs like the genre was waiting for him to arrive!
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-24,"Absolutely loved this movie. I didn&#39;t watch any trailers or read anything about it prior to watching it, I went to the theater one day, saw a poster with Russel Crowe as an exorcist and said &quot;say no more&quot;. I went in hoping for a fun exorcist movie, and that&#39;s exactly what I got!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-20,"Saw it with my husband last night and had similar comments. As a Catholic, it&#39;s nice to have a depiction of a priest who&#39;s faithful, likeable and charming. I think this movie shows the power a world class actor has to elevate an otherwise average film. Russel Crowe made this movie so enjoyable. Nothing felt offensive or preachy. At the end of the day, it was just good old fashioned Hollywood entertainment. The other compliment I would give is to the camera work. There was something about the angles and movement that felt good."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Looks like a crazy twist to it
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,I love it when seasoned actors star in movies about the supernatural‚Ä¶Anthony Hopkins was the best thing about the movie The Rite and I personally feel that Russell will deliver the same exact stellar performance in this movie. I‚Äôm there!
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-08,"Man! This is hands down the best horror movie I‚Äôve ever watched. No cheesy jump scares, dialogue and stupid characters. Went in completely blind: watched no trailers or anything, the movie is so immersive, it pulled me in immediately ( probably because of the joint I smoked before going in to watch üòÇ) This movie is a horror gem.üî•"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-01,"Its really cool to see Russell Crowe in these different roles, especially now that he is older, it definitely suits him!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-18,"I read one of Fr. Amorth&#39;s books. He&#39;s very upbeat, positive and sounds like a fun person. Even though he was dealing with absolute horror he had no doubt that God had his back, he was almost completely fearless. These movies exaggerate typical exorcisms but there are usually 1 or 2 that are particularly nasty. The church has gotten very good at preventing exorcisms from getting out of control. They&#39;ve had 2,000 years to know what to do and what not to do. They are careful to rule out mental illness as well. I mean who wants to waste time doing an exorcism ritual on someone who isn&#39;t possessed?"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,"It&#39;s-a me, Russello Croweo, the Exorcisto."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-13,"I know everyone pays their tribute to the amazing work Russel Crowe did with this move, I mean he made the whole move actually whit the personality he gave to the priest, but let‚Äôs also appreciate this little boy who played the demon! I don‚Äôt know how so young little boy managed to pull out this role! He was amazing too‚ù§"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russell Crowe is stepping into a whole new role/ character. I cant wait to see it.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,Who else thought this was the new Exorcist sequel haha
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,I love how dramatic demons are. They would do so well in drama school.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-19,"I wasn‚Äôt really interested after watching the first 2-3 minutes.    I thought it was just another one of those boring exorcist horror movies.   So I left it.   A couple of days later , I decided to give it another chance.    Well, surprise, surprise!!    After 10 minutes,, I was hooked !!!   From a young gladiator hunk to an aging overweight priest,, Russell Crowe did well in this film."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-06,Fr. Gabriele Amorth helped tens of thousands of people who were suffering and believed they were hopeless.<br>I hope they show the respect he deserves in this movie.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-02,"Was so blessed to attend padre Amorth s masses in Italy back in the 90s. He was really anointed by the Lord, especially during the healings prayer. The devil used to go mad and shouting and swearing."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,"I see an &quot;Exorcism&quot; related title, I click. The Exorcist is literally one of my favorite movies of all time."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-27,The demon kid actor is giving major 1st Harry Potter movie child actor vibes.....<br>The first Exorcist was SO INCREDIBLE because of the amazingly talented actors . Linda was young but very talented. It makes a big difference.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-05,"From being raised catholic, I understand it is near impossible to even get permission to do an exorcism. All medical avenues need to be exhausted and parlor tricks do not get a pass to get permission. I&#39;ve always been totally fascinated by the process and the fact that there is such a place these things were documented."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,I will watch this for sure. Russell is one of my favourite actor. Not gonna miss on it
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,"Russell Crowe, whatever movie he will do I will watch it. He has been one of the best film actors of the last 30 years."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-25,Did I just watch the whole trailer thinking it was a fat Antonio Banderas? lol
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russell Crowe in a horror movie? I‚Äôm in.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-06,He‚Äôs the only actor left who can get me into a movie theater. Will definitely see it.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-23,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE it‚Äôs VERY good and not too gory and it‚Äôs based off a book. The best part is this exorcism actually happened. It was based off a book and Father Gabriel Amorth was an actual exorcist. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs gonna be a part 2 because there‚Äôs two books and there‚Äôs different places around the world with this problem.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-06-01,"Just finished watching I am so happy that it teaches us to always Learn to confess our sins,forgive others and above All forgive ourselves"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,Man the way the eyes of the demon is revealed behind the eyes of the kid! Classic! I&#39;m excited for this
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-02,I read 3 of Father Amorth books and he is the real deal. He went through a lot of shit with all those exorcisms battling satan. His books are amazing and I would highly recommend that you read them before you watch the movie. The movie is going to give you a lot of Hollywood hype.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,This looks sickeningly good however I felt that the trailer showed too muchüò•
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-04,Russell at the end of the movie: &quot;Are you not entertained?&quot;
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-16,"Before I became Christian I lived alone in an apartment.   Was dating an unchristian person, life going no where.  A young woman was murdered behind my apt. complex.  Not long after I had an experience with night paralysis and woke up to this darkness with eyes watching me I could not move.  This was so frightening I slept in the living room with the lights on.  Then started sleeping at my partners house and did not want to go to my apartment.    The relationship was empty, broken, but still I did not want to go to my apartment.  Shortly after I did break up and went out and met this other person who ended up taking me to church, and I converted to Christianity.  After that...  no darkness forms against me.  I am a child of the most high God.  Evil can only go where it is directly or indirectly invited."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-17,It‚Äôs great to see Alex Essoe in another movie. Incredible and very underrated actress. The fact that she and Russell Crowe are in this is enough for me to check it out.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russell Crowe is such a great actor. When I first saw Gladiator back in the day I knew he will bring more great stuff to a screen
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-11,"‚ÄûRemember, when we jeer at the Devil and tell ourselves that he does not exist, that is when he is happiest.‚Äú<br><br>- Fr. Gabriele Amorth, S. S. P. <br><br>This movie is in tune with William Friedkin&#39;s The Exorcist.   Russel Crowe delivers.  Kudos to the Production Team.  I cannot wait for more stories of Fr. Amorth battling it out with Demons."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-03,Not typically into exorcism films but I‚Äôll watch it as Russell Crowe is in it !! üëçüèº
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-05,"This really has the feel of a mystery behind the horror which I love. And Russel like plays the veteran detective. This is based on a real man where he performed about 10,000 exorcists. Russel got to know the people The exorcist worked with and he said you can tell that these people truly believe they had these experiences whether you believe in it or not. I personally have had demons whisper to me vile things in a different language but I understood what they were getting at during a sleep paralysis episode. After that there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind these entities exist and when I prayed to Jesus I haven‚Äôt had an episode since. There are countless stories like mine. Look up the asbury revival exorcism and listen to the scream that comes out of the ladies mouth. It‚Äôs authentic footage. Hundreds of people were there. Evil absolutely does exist and is not subjective."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-25,I freaking love paranormal horror films! Russell Crowe has my support! Excellent actor!
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-22,sick of Youtube making you sit through 15 seconds with no option to skip and then make you wait 15 seconds to be able to skip a long advertisement
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-30,"I&#39;ve read one of Father Gabriel Amorth&#39;s books. They have plenty of terrifying material to work with. Also if you have done any research into the rites of exorcism you&#39;ll find his name is everywhere. Russel Crowe is a great actor, he&#39;s had some not so great roles lately. I feel like this could and should redeem that. <br><br>There are a lot of really good books, interviews and witnesses in addition to other media types they can use for this. I hope the writers took this job seriously, Father Amorth deserves nothing less for his legacy RIP"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-01,This looks so good. It has the vibes of a thriller/paranormal thing and not an horror movie.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,I will never get tired of these Possession or Exorcist films.<br>In fact they make up a good chunk of my horror film DVD collection.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-28,This movie is so good. They talk about things they don‚Äôt in other movies about the church Vatican. Don‚Äôt want to spoil it. I read part 2 is green lit.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-02,Russell Crowe is one of the few actors that always remains to get epic roles big fan
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-25,I‚Äôm Catholic myself. What Father Amorth fought is very real.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-02,‚ÄúWhat we do in life‚Ä¶..echoes in eternity.‚Äù ‚Äì Maximus
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-09-11,"I watched this in Netflix.. Left me with something like how? Not about the movie.. But on how good is Russel Crowe was.. The way he speak, the accent, the silent joke and everything.. He is absolutely monster with his own skill.. Nailed it perfectly"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-24,Definitely a must watch it‚Äôs good to see a horror that looks decent enough to be scary nowadays
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,I bought Father Gabriele Amorth‚Äôs book a year or two ago. I recommend it to everyone. I can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-16,Just seen it. Russell is incredible in this movie made it from a 5 to an 8. Loved it
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-11-02,"I liked it a lot. Way better than the average jumpscare movie. Good script, acting, humor and effects. And how can I forget Julius Avery himself! Masterful directing, he knows how to keep the action in the center of the screen at all times. Almost no shaky cam either!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,"This looks pretty solid, I don&#39;t watch movies often but I&#39;ll definitely be watching this."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Father Gabriel Amorth was a true soldier for the Lord
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,"I Love Catholic horror movies because I think they send a message more than other horror movies, especially a movie concerning exorcism"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-24,No one should Watch this film...10% truth has been showed with 90% Lies....and also christians you can be demonized or demon possessed by this film...stay safeüôèüèª
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,"Gabriele Pietro Amorth (Modena, 1 May 1925 - Rome, 16 September 2016) was an Italian priest and writer, exorcist of the diocese of Rome.<br>In 2017 is released a documentary directed by the well-known director William Friedkin of the film The Exorcist, which narrates the ninth exorcism of an Italian woman in the city of Venafro called &quot;Cristina&quot;. It was one of the most terrible exorcisms ever done."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-02,‚ÄúBring me a priest‚Äù as possessed has to be the most terrifying thing I‚Äôve seen in a film in a while.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-20,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJXqvnT_rsk&amp;t=6"">0:06</a> why are demons always so funny in these movies lmfaoo."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-07,I love this film. Russell Crowe&#39;s performance was way beyond phenomenal.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-22,Mr. Crowe is a scary and yet compelling man to watch ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINE !? ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINE !?
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russel Crowe in a horror film is a must watch for me.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,"Io ho conosciuto Padre Amorth a Milano, 10 anni fa, diceva sempre: &quot;√® il diavolo che ha paura di me&quot;"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-06,You know what this film is like? It&#39;s the DaVinci Code filtered through a literal interpretation of The Exorcist. It&#39;s ridiculous and occasionally an apologist for historical atrocities committed by the Church
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-26,What I like about Russ he&#39;s down to earth and a real country boy rather be at home having a yarn and beer than attending Oscars. -  look forward seeing this movie with great anticipation.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,I‚Äôm a not a fan of horror type films but I love the supernatural stuff. And it seems to go into the route of also being action type film of Russel Crowe fighting demons with the Bible‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm inüòÇ
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-28,"man, just finished watching the movie  LOVED Russell Crowe, his character was so good that I got invested on the movie cause of him"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,"That voice gives me chills <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJXqvnT_rsk&amp;t=119"">1:59</a>"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-25,Call me very religious but am I the only one who got goosebumps seeing Virgin Mary rise from the ground floating. Beautifully depicted on how I truly think Mary would look like if we were visited by her or greeted by her after this life. Her vail and the colours of her silk cloths just rippling by the invisible force of the Holy Spirit
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-24,Oh I hope this will be portrayed right. Looks awesome from the trailer. I had to learn about Father Gabriele Amorth and have read his book and watched his documentary. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing this !!
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-30,"most concise definition of God in Islam is given in s four verses of Surah Al Ikhlaas, which is Chapter 112 of the Qur‚Äôan: <br> <br>  <br>‚ÄúSay: He is Allah, The One and Only. <br> Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. <br>He begets not, nor is He begotten. <br> <br> <br>  <br>And there is none like unto Him.‚Äù <br>[Al-Qur‚Äôan 112:1-4] <br> <br>The word ‚ÄòAl Samad‚Äô is difficult to translate. It means ‚Äòabsolute existence,‚Äô which can be attributed only to Allah (swt), all other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that Allah (swt) is not dependant on any person or thing, but all persons and things are dependant on Him."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-01,"I never get tired of exorcism movies, looking forward to this oneüòÅ"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-28,I read many of Father Amorth&#39;s books. So logical and explain things very clearly.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-22,"I love how the plot actually gives you concepts to really make you think! I can‚Äôt wait see this with my dad, we are Exorcist and horror junkies!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-08-02,I was pleasantly surprised how good this was. Even more so with the way it ended teasing that there could be more to come.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Not usually interested in supernatural films but this looks outstanding.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-27,"This looks amazing.  Possession is real people. I have seen someone shapeshifted in front of me when I was in a college classroom.  There was a Goth girl that use to sit next to me in class all the time.  One day I said something to the professor and she started laughing and that is when her voice and face changed.  No one else seemed to notice it.  I was generally freaked out and froze in fear.  When she saw that I saw what inhabited her body, She then got up and left the classroom.  After that she never sat next to me again and started avoiding me.  There were times she missed class for days.  After that I remembered how odd she use to smell.  It wasn&#39;t a body odor and she always looked clean and dressed nice in her Goth fashion, but she had an odd odor about her and sometimes it seems as if she had a shadow or an out of focus mist covering her body.  Like she was out of focus.  Every time she sat next to me I always had to grab my scarf or sweater because I started freezing for some reason.  The day that thing popped out of her it all started to make sense to me.  Weird stuff started happening in my home for weeks.  I was generally freaked the hell out.  Its almost like it was mad that it exposed itself to me.  I had to blessed my home everyday until most of the weirdness stopped.  It never completely went away until we sold that condo.  There are unexplained and explained things out here people.  The Church knows it and they have the tools to expel most demons and possessed people."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russell Crowe is back. A return to form. This actually looks really interesting and creepy.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2025-01-24,THIS FILM IS SO UNBELIEVABLE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.at one point a man manages to ride a LAMBRETTA all the way from Rome to Spain üòÇ
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-01,"I&#39;m too afraid to watch horror movies, but I&#39;ll definitely watch this and bring some pillows so cover my whole face just to watch this and finish the movie. Damn, I&#39;m super excited!"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-02,His role on Gladiator makes him to be loved  in all of roles. What amazing movie it was. And we will watch this movie just because of Russel Crowe. ƒ∞t doesn&#39;t matter it is good or not :))
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-19,Russell Crowe can do no wrong. This looks amazing. üëå
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-05-25,"I typically don&#39;t watch the exorcist movies. They are not as scary as I would like them to be and usually the person who plays the priest is not that entertaining. However, Russell elevated this movie to another level with his incredible acting and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you believe in God, you must believe in evil. This movie was very enjoyable and I would watch it again."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-09,Yes. We need more movies on such topics. At least near accurate to depicting the situations surrouning possessions or exorcisms
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-04-15,"I saw this movie yesterday, if you have anxiety DONT WATCH, or at least take some anxiety pills. Because it was way too much for me. I‚Äôm a huge fan of horror movies but this was the only movie that I had trouble with. My fingers went numb, I got horrible chills, my heart was raving, I was sweating, I felt like I was the possessed one lol. It was amazing, but too much for me."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-23,Russell crow in an exorcist horror movie!? I think horror is finally getting some recognition for how awesome it is!
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2024-05-31,"Just watched this movie and I gotta say this was breathtaking.<br>Everything about this film is just sooooo good.... the actors, the scenery, the production value, the plot, the atmosphere LIKE DAMN I feel empty because of how great it was. Now that I&#39;ve seen this I know that there&#39;s a void I won&#39;t be able to fill for a while!<br>I really hoped for a cliffhanger towards the end that points to a sequel. Sadly I was let down."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-28,"Wow, an Amorth movie! Can&#39;t wait! We need more movies like The Conjuring franchise or The Exorcism of Emily Rose. This new one seems pretty dark and cool."
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-20,"I don&#39;t know why, despite feeling like this is going to be very silly,  I&#39;ll even pray that this is actually going to be amazing. üôè"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-03-19,Russ is playing the Vatican‚Äôs most famous and best exorcist. His biography is neat as he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs done hundreds of them. Everyone always asked if it‚Äôs mental illness or trauma. Hundreds of those except one. He says only one time he experienced fear and believed that one was the embodiment of evil. <br><br>I‚Äôm not superstitious so I really don‚Äôt care or believe in that much like ghosts. I do love horror and can‚Äôt wait for this.
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-09-27,"Loved this movie. Rather than throwing in many jump scares, the team pulled of the horror by getting nasty and disturbing which was good to watch. Would recommend this movie 9/10"
The Pope's Exorcist,YJXqvnT_rsk,2023-02-28,"I think it&#39;s very important to know the real story of Padre Gabriele Amorth before going to see this movie. As I&#39;ve seen, the movie is inspired by his real life, and there are many interviews with Don Gabriele Amorth, as well as several books he wrote years ago about his ministry.<br><br>As a Catholic Christian, I can say that I find Monsignor Father Amorth&#39;s direct testimony more important. For those who knew him, he was described as a cheerful and witty person, always ready to help others and with great humanity. The film certainly has other objectives, such as being visually striking and intriguing to attract a large number of people to the cinema and earn a lot of money. I sincerely hope that the figure of Father Amorth is faithfully portrayed, but it makes me reflect on the fact that even in the choice of the actor, someone who does not resemble him at all was selected (not to take anything away from Russell Crowe, whom I respect as an actor)."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-19,I love how this was obviously shot on film and feels like a late 80s early 90s dramedy. This is how you organically involve aesthetics in your art without making the point of the art the aesthetics themselves
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-04-14,"Watched this and I cried, what a simple Masterpiece , Brilliantly acted out by the main characters. A huge must watch."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-28,"Saw this trailer before Oppenheimer, I was blown away that this trailer actually managed to capture the actual look of an old film that so many try and fail to capture because they look too polished. Seems to be a smart, heartwarming film! Almost pulled out of time! Can&#39;t wait to see it!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-27,The actor here Dominic Sessa was one of my brothers childhood best friends and this is his first breakout work and I‚Äôm so shocked and excited to see him in this
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"This trailer feels so much like what trailers felt like in the late 90s or early 2000s... movie trailer voice, the editing between the music and the voices/lines and the shots, that very particular tempo between those three things... It struck me how I haven&#39;t seen a trailer like this in very a long time. It&#39;s super well made, just on that basis.<br><br>And a movie directed by the director of The Descendants, and with Paul Giamatti playing a History or Classics professor... I&#39;m in!!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-10,I can‚Äôt believe Dominic sessa got discovered for this movie. He‚Äôs got such organic and natural acting
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-16,"I&#39;ve seen this heartwarming film three times now. I am facing xmas alone with myocarditis prevending me from flying home to be with my family. Might sound silly, but this film is helping me get through it. Merry Christmas all, especially those dealing with loneliness. Give this film a try, you wont regret it!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-16,"I have to say, this is one of Paul Giamatti&#39;s greatest performances of his entire career. I just watched it and felt transported back in time!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-17,This movie feels like it‚Äôs from a bygone era. It needs to be seen by everyone. It feels so authentic to the time period it takes place in and the warmth that this story brings is a feeling I haven‚Äôt had watching a new film in a long time. I‚Äôm so glad movies like this are still being made
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-25,"Theres been a lot of throwback films recently but this has to be the most authentic emulation I&#39;ve seen yet. Even the sound, which I don&#39;t really know how they did at all, its so heartwarming to see. I&#39;m real excited to see this"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-11-27,"Man I loved this movie. I laughed, cried, and smiled. Absolutely the way movies should be made."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-22,This movie was absolutely brilliant. Truly. Just great humor and a nice balance of human kindness that and the bond that unlikely humans can make. Highly recommend.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,I feel like Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph is on the Octavia Spencer career trajectory where she&#39;s doing these supporting roles in so many different genres and absolutely KILLING it and then she&#39;s gonna get that one breakout part that truly lifts her into A-list and I am absolutely here for all of it.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-06,"First off I have to say this is one of Paul Giamatti‚Äôs greatest performances in his entire career. And the rest of the cast is perfection as well. Everyone involved in this movie is Oscar Worthy. The Holdovers really reminded me of the film style and comedy/drama tone of classic 1970‚Äôs era classic movies from the great Hal Ashby, such as The Landlord, Harold And Maude, The Last Detail and Being There. Also it reminded me of classic 70‚Äôs movies from Bob Rafelson like Five Easy Pieces and The King Of Marvin Gardens. You could make a case that this movie is right up there with these great classics from that era. It feels like an all time great lost gem directly from the 70‚Äôs"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-21,Saw this today in the theater and loved it. One of the best movie experiences I‚Äôve had in a while.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-19,"Just saw it in theatres! This is an absolutely fantastic period piece; very accurate to 1970. It is very bittersweet, but charming. Highly recommend!‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-12-10,"I just saw this. It&#39;s the best Christmas movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It conveys the real meaning of Christmas: love for our fellow human beings, even if it comes at a high cost to ourselves."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-23,"I&#39;m beyond excited for &#39;The Holdovers&#39;! The fact that they filmed at Fairhaven High School, my old stomping grounds, just adds an extra layer of anticipation. Seeing the Knipe Auditorium on the big screen, where I used to hang out and goof off between classes, is going to be a surreal experience. It&#39;s not every day you get to see a place so familiar and full of personal memories featured in a movie. Can&#39;t wait to see it!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-01,I paid $6 and went to a matinee showing of this in Portland Oregon at the 100-year-old Laurelhurst Theater. I was the only person in the audience under 60. It was a good film. I mostly went for Paul Giamatti and remembering him in Sideways 20 years ago. Love all the wool and corduroy. Also a nice appearance of a 1950&#39;s Gem G-Bar single edge safety razor in the opening shot and a Everready Commander flashlight.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-08-04,I was a background actor in this film. I cannot wait to see the entire film! Just the scenes I was involved in were hilarious! I forsee an Oscar for this film! (not for me LOL)
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-30,"Dominic Sessa reminds me of young Tom Hanks‚Ä¶ The look, the acting.. everything"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-03,"What a great movie‚Ä¶I wonder why I watched it only now! I haven‚Äôt enjoyed a movie this much for a long long time. The performance of the actors, every single one of them just nailed it. How every detail is so cinematographic. It felt like I was watching someone‚Äôs real life from my window, occasionally noticing the weather change. Masterpiece."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-22,I love how this movie feels like an 80‚Äôs or 90‚Äôs movie that got locked in a vault for 30 or 40 years and is just now being released. Looks great! Looks unique and different. Can‚Äôt wait!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-09-11,&quot;I find the world a bitter and complicated place and it seems to feel the same way about me. I think you and I have this in common.&quot; <br><br>Just give Giamatti the Oscar already
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,This is the year for Paul Giamatti&#39;s Oscar that he truly deserved for Sideways.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-09,Paul Giamatti better get the Oscar for this.   Dominic Sessa and Da‚ÄôVine Joy Randolph too!     Paul Giamatti exceeded his reach!    Give him the golden ring.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,The Breakfast Club meets Dead Poets Society. I&#39;m game.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-19,"That is a very &#39;70s style old school trailer with the narration, the freeze frame, and let me tell you I am HERE FOR IT"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-19,Never realise how much i missed these old film vibes
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-15,"Seriously one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long, long time. Unfortunately, I was the only one in the theater. I mean, it was a Monday night at 10pm, but still... This is going to be a Holiday classic, no question."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,This really looks good!! Like it would have been made 30 years ago
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-27,"Saw this film in the cinema this evening. Really moved by it, cried a lot and laughed a lot. Made me remember that a film doesn&#39;t have to be sensational to be good."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-20,Alexander Payne always makes the characters grow by already throwing them in a complicated life situation
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-14,"Great movie. Such a relief to have a quality movie driven by depth of character, a compelling story, heartfelt acting, and based in modest reality. We need more movies like this, and less insulting CGI drivel."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-11-19,the sheer volume of content:passage of time ratio this film manages to achieve is absolutely insane. the deep exploration of each main character is so masterfully done that the clich√©s feel like they&#39;ve never been seen before. probably one of my all time favourite movies ever
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-18,"&quot;Crying, crying never did nobody no good no how&quot; Fantastic drama played flawlessly by the master Paul Giamatti. Loved the sound track."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-18,I haven‚Äôt been excited for an indie film in a long time. This looks fantastic.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,A trailer which reinstates my belief in Mr. Payne. So well made and it made me smile and also sad. Eagerly waiting!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-07-22,Whenever they say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make movies like they used to.‚Äù This is an exception
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-30,This is a great movie anyone that has experienced loss knows the feelings the movie shows during the holidays. Very relatable and was entertaining every second.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-30,Beautifully shot film. Hard to believe it was made in 2023. It had the perfect 80&#39;s 90&#39;s aesthetic. Even this trailer is straight from the 90&#39;s.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-06,"Watched tbis movie last night, without any expectations. I was so amazed by everything, the humor, the feel of New England around Christmas time but more importantly a heart warming story of friendship."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-28,I saw the trailer for this movie for the first time at a theater and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt tell for a bit if this was a new movie or a re-release of a movie from 30-40 years ago. This trailer definitely has me hooked.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-09-12,This film does not disappoint. One of Payne&#39;s best!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"&quot;Sir, I don&#39;t understand&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s glaringly apparent!&quot;<br>&quot;I can&#39;t fail this class!&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t sell yourself short, Mr. Kountze, I truly believe that you can.&quot;"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-09,"Watched it today at the cinemas.<br>Such an uplifting, witty and claver film.<br>Paul Giamatti is a hell of an actor, hope for him that he will surprise everybody and will win the Oscar tomorrow night for best actorü§ûüèæ"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"Hopefully this movie does well, so that way we can get more movie trailers like this."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-30,Da‚ÄôVine Joy Randolph better come thru!!! She is fantastic in every role
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-22,This film must win the oscar for best picture. Brilliant movie.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-05,"Saw this at a festival and can‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs out in theaters everywhere, such a pure story of boyhood and loneliness. It is dead poets society and so much more!!!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-09,"Brilliant movie. Brilliant script, casting, directing. I laughed. I cried. It was for me the most satisfaying movie of 2023!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-12-04,This movie is a stonecold masterpiece
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-08-02,Giamatti is exceptional will definitely see this. He deserves so much more
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-20,"I never saw the trailer. I just saw the movie poster one day while passing an AMC, decided to see it and was blown away by the acting, script-writing, and excellent cinematography! <br><br>I don&#39;t know if this is an &quot;Oscar-bait film&quot;, but its defiantly gonna win some awards come January!!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,Looks like Paul Giamatti will finally get his long awaited Best Actor nomination!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-21,I&#39;m just back from the theater. <br>This is a brilliant and touching movie. <br>I strongly recommend it.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-18,"The characters feel like people! I&#39;ll gladly watch this with my friends, and then watch it again. Bravo Focus Features for this breath of fresh air"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-04,"I loved this film. The main actors - Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph - and all of the supporting actors were fantastic. Highly recommend seeing this on whatever platform you can."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"Stunned to see a trailer that doesn&#39;t have the patented Netflix drum banging the drama home to emphasise how you were about to witness the biggest thing ever. Even the new Pixar trailer had it, because Disney presumably told the makers that every film now needs one. I was expecting the only escape I&#39;d ever get from this was to just watch overseas movies like the new Miyazaki, but Payne proves a trailer can be done without it and the Universe doesn&#39;t immediately self destruct afterwards, go figure."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-02-25,"Just finished watching this film, it will be looked at as a classic years from now. Absolutely amazing."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-08-17,"I saw this trailer when I saw Oppenheimer a few days ago, but I have to say I‚Äôm really impressed with the old-school aesthetics to make it look like a movie trailer from the 70s. I always love it when Movie‚Äôs take the extra step to truly emulate the era their setting. Reminds me of the artist which resembled a silent picture of the 20s."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-06,"Us preppies from that era experienced this show on a smiling, personal level. Great to visit my campus(es) again, and yes, those snowy campus sidewalk scenes were credibly cold! Great film. ‚ù§"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,This looks like an extremely cozy movie! I‚Äôll definitely check it out!!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-31,"I honestly went into this thinking it was going to largely be a comedy, but what I found was one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a very long time."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-23,"This movie may not be super popular right now, but I&#39;m willing to bet it&#39;ll catch on as a Christmas classic. <br>It&#39;s soooo good."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-04-22,"I am an absolute connoisseur of film and I would put this in my top 40 of all time EASY.  I was so happy with this film, wonderfully executed.  Also.. growing up in my grandma&#39;s house with my parents coming of age in early 70s, and my gms house untouched from the 70s, being a kid in the 90s with vestiges of the 70s everywhere still..  WOW aesthetically this film touched my soul.  Perfect Americana"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,Can‚Äôt go wrong with Payne and Giamatti‚ù§Ô∏è
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-04-01,"Just finished watching this beautiful film‚ù§. Well deserved praise all around. I predict this will be a yearly watch from now on. So happy great films with real acting and no need for CGI or over- compensating physical ‚Äútransformations/glow-ups‚Äù can still be made. Character development and intelligent script, as it used to be. And, cannot wait to see more of the talented cast, specially the sharp Ms. Randolph, post Academy Award, and the newcomer Mr. Sessa! This film was a true joy to see üòä."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-26,"Just saw this and honestly, I want to see it again tomorrow. So well done, lots of heart, every single performance is riveting and Alexander Payne is a genius."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-08,Something that modern films trying to replicate older films rarely get right is the audio quality. This has got it perfect!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-10-29,"Just watched it. It&#39;s really, really heartwarming, good. Highly recommended for a X-mas movie!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-23,I am absolutely living for this 70s style  film. I‚Äôm SO excited to see this

The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2025-02-21,Sometimes you need a Christmas movie that gives you a good cry.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"This looks like a fresh retro movie, unlike most retro movies it feels like it was written by someone who what around at those times"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-07,"from the first act i was hooked and invested <br><br>the second act i was comforted and as happy as i could have been <br><br>the third act i was absolutely gut punched and heartbroken. all together one of the best and most original films of the year, so cool to be here at the beginning of Dominic Sessas career. amazing film"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-02-26,"Fabulous film! Giamatti is sublime. I like it when he says, &quot; History is not just a study of the past, it is an explanation of the present. &quot; Profound!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-25,"An amazing film, great acting, great script, great composition, meticulous period piece and contextualized characters. My new fav Christmas movie"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-02-01,Paul Giamatti‚Äôs acting is on another level. I never miss a movie with him in it.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-02-20,The song is Glad by Traffic in case anyone is wondering. It used to play in auditoriums and on trailers all the time. Excellent choice here.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-05-02,"What a beautifully crafted film. Cinema at its highest level. Everyone involved in this film should be proud of themselves. Of course as usual Paul Gianotti gives a spectacular performance. The young man Dominic Sessa is a powerhouse. He gives a rebellious but tender performance just outstanding. Don&#39;t misunderstand me the whole cast was just excellent. So will written David Hemingson....Alexander Payne, I have talked to you. Wow. Cinnamontography I loved the flow.. Thank you so much for showing Hollywood what quality is."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-29,"What a sweet movie, I love 70‚Äôs movies and they did a great job capturing that time! üíï"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-07-07,The best film I have seen since Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.  I am still laughing and weeping. I was a holdover...now I&#39;m a teacher on my 39th year. Full circle.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-12-06,Paul Giamatti is a movie star. Forget all the actors with movie star looks but no real substance. This guy is the real deal.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2025-01-31,"Hands down one of the best movies in recent years, along with CODA."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-18,Oh what a breath of fresh air this trailer was!<br>Can&#39;t wait to watch it!
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-07-13,"It&#39;s an excellent movie, and Paul Giamatti‚Äôs performance is just, oh! What an actor! Dominic very organic too."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-11,I loved the movie. Paul should have won best actor.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"This film is a homage to cinema, for that reason, I&#39;m in!"
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-01-18,Just saw the movie here in Rome. I think it&#39;s a masterpiece of our times.
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-04-08,"This is one of my favorite movies in a really long time. So heartwarming &amp; funny, amazing actors. Will rewatch every year"

The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-07,I appreciate the deep voice narration like the 90s movies.

The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,"Please go see this, these are the types of movies I wish they made more of."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2024-03-02,"Beautiful film. I watched it on a plane without knowing anything about it. They offer a huge selection of movies, but few look interesting. So I thought I&#39;d try a wildcard. Such a gem. Thank you."
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-07-17,the freeze frame at the end make me choke with laughtersüòÇ
The Holdovers,AhKLpJmHhIg,2023-11-25,"I see Alexander Payne and Paul Giamatti, I buy a ticket."

The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-05-24,"Imagine a white movie that has so many off-color jokes about Black people, and that felt the need to constantly elevate the white race in every situation. Does everything have to be about black/white or racism?  I want to see a black movie with good actors and a good story where race is never mentioned and there are no jokes about white people. Just let the movie stand on the story and acting alone."

The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-07-08,"Seen it and its gold, pure gold. Especially the ending."
The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-05-25,"Actually, black characters almost never die first. (Although they almost never survive, either.) In fact, the only movies I can immediately recall where the first victim was black as Scream 2 and Leprechaun in the Hood. Like, if you look at all of Michael, Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Leatherface, and Chucky combined, you‚Äôve got about 40-50 movies where not once is the first victim black.<br><br>I just think it‚Äôs weird that people have always accepted blacks dying first as an actual thing that happens on a regular basis without actually seeing it and not once have I heard anyone call BS on it"
The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-03-03,Finally a good comedy movie there has been a lot of misses but where finally back baby

The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-05-17,"I have an amazing story if anyone&#39;s interested. One time I was driving home and I felt the presence of the Lord, come down to me from above. I started getting chills and I felt so comfortable with Him. <br>I knew if I asked Him to play a song on the radio, He would.<br>So I said &quot;Ok Lord, play Come as you are...&quot;<br>I didn&#39;t know what station it was on or anything, but I turned the radio on and the song started playing right on the spot, perfectly...<br>I started getting flooded with chills inside, and started crying. When I got home, He stayed with me for 10 minutes till I got out of the car.<br><br>I&#39;ve been getting answered prayers for around 5 years since, because that visitation eliminated doubt and I follow Biblical instructions as best as I can."
The Blackening,moiRCJR4ToY,2023-03-14,This made me laugh a bunch of times. I&#39;m kind of amazed this hasn&#39;t been done before. Or has it? That moment when he turns the gun from sideways to upright üòÇ

One thing though........Jane fonda has had so much work done to her face that she&#39;s starting to look scary.  Please stop the cosmetic procedures Jane.

Work does bring people together that otherwise wouldn&#39;t occur whether they need the money or not there knows maybe they&#39;re philanthropist but what a concept I think we can all learn or this is a way of exercising their mind body and soul show the rest of those who are approaching a Divine age that it doesn&#39;t matter just do what you enjoy and everything else will fall in place.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"Shuri posing as the new Black Panther is all I&#39;ve been waiting for! If I were a king and I only had a sister, I would smile from above if I saw her taking my place! Love this film with all my heart. I&#39;m hearing this movie will be one of the longest in the MCU, means far better story and structure! Oh Marvel, I cannot wait for this to release!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I&#39;m so glad this trailer is taking everything seriously, no jokes, no goofs, only an emotional and strong reminder of who&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost and a actor that was a legend and the legacy left behind.<br><br>Wow people really upset over this huh LMAO."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-07-24,"The first few minutes, with the Marvel Logo rolling in silence, is the most impactful intro of any MCU movie to date. The fact that nothing was playing during the Marvel Studios Logo roll, was so amazing as a tribute to Chadwick Boseman"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-10,Chadwicks passing was a tragedy. It won&#39;t be the same without him but I hope they make this as best as they can. Rest in peace Chadwick. It was way way too soon.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,I&#39;m honestly kinda shocked and impressed that they decided to keep Namor&#39;s foot wings. It&#39;s not as ridiculous as I feared.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I loved the music. You can feel the powerful emotions in every sound. Throughout the trailer you always feel the grief, it never left but there is that feeling that doesn&#39;t stop the sorrows but it&#39;s telling you that no matter how broken you are you always keep moving forward. Chadwick&#39;s legacy will live on"

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"The soundtrack used for the trailer is Zambian (Sampha The Great ft. Chef 187 x Tio x Mwanje - Never Forget)<br>and it was sang in Nyanja and Bemba. There&#39;s a time around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> where Tio sings<br>&quot;ndiwe mfumu lelo osayibala&quot; <br>these lyrics directly translates to <br>&quot;You&#39;re king now, do not forget (never forget)&quot; which is in direct reference to both Namor&#39;s kingship and Shuri&#39;s ascendance to the Throne! Zambia to the world."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"Literal goosebumps. Whoever is editing Wakanda Forever&#39;s trailers, deserves an award of its own."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"We all know that no one can replace Chadwick Boseman, but I‚Äôm glad that the director, cast, &amp; crew was able to persevere and still be able to deliver this movie.  I got a good feeling about this one.."

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-11-11,‚ÄúOnly the most broken people can be great leaders‚Äù man that line gave me chills fown my spine
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-06,"I know most people aren&#39;t going to agree with me, and I&#39;m sad he&#39;s gone too, but I think incorporating Chadwick&#39;s death into the movie makes it feel more real. He&#39;s gone in real life, he&#39;s gone in the movies and I believe it pays homage to his legacy. In the very short time we saw him on screen he was one of the best comic book portrayals of a character, right up there with RDJ as Tony Stark and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. So deciding not to recast makes it feel like the movie has more weight and realism."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-06,"Both the Wakanda Forever trailers have been some of the most creative, artfully done Marvel trailers in a long while. And great soundtracks too."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-05-13,This is still one of my favourite movies from phase four because the last scene with Shuri reminiscing her memories of T‚ÄôChalla broke my heart into a million pieces and I will never get over the ending because the movie has been an emotional rollercoaster I‚Äôve had in a long time.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"M&#39;bakus dialog, Mother Queens dialog, fighting sequence in wakanda, M&#39;baku and Okoye holding Shuri while she cries, the music, seeing riri in the Iron heart suit, Namor hovering with the spear, and seeing Shuri descend in the Black Panther suit, etc. I got pure chills and goosebumps from beginning, Middle, and end. I&#39;m definitely buying my ticket"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"For Chadwick, your legacy will live on for many years to come! You are Black Panther, the hero that defined a new generation. Wakanda Forever!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,All Awesomeness aside.. Can we just agree on how Epic the music and song sound in this. Gave me chills man
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2024-11-12,"Happy 2nd anniversary, Black Panther Wakanda Forever!!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,The detail of the suit absorbing the landing at the end was freaking AWESOME ü§Ø
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-25,"It&#39;s hard to explain the silent charisma, dignity and wisdom Chadwick Boseman brought to T&#39;Chala.  He commands every scene he&#39;s in and you&#39;re just waiting for his next line.  Like a vibranium meteor, he was a blessing to cinema.  He is deeply missed.  Wakanda Forever."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-04,I gotta say the music choices for both trailers are just phenomenal. It totally captured the mood and emotions of the trailers and enhance the experience even more.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-06-10,The fact that we will forever have this  always warms my heart‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üáøüá≤
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"This trailer brings back so many memories. Chadwick Boseman would have loved this, this is probably what he would have wanted. Thank you Marvel for respecting his legacy, I will definitely watch this keeping him in my memories :("
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"This trailer is exactly what we all needed to get hyped. The new Black Panther suit looks insane, so does Iron Heart&#39;s. The cgi looks great, and of course the cinematography is everything I hoped for. I can&#39;t wait for this movie"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-02-15,Nobody could ever replace BOSEMAN he would always be the black panther.. RIP LEGEND ‚ù§
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-07,"It won&#39;t be the same, but I know they worked so hard to put out this movie. I&#39;ll definitely support it."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I love how Ramonda says to Shuri, &quot;Show them who WE are&quot; whereas in the first movie she said &quot;Show them who YOU are&quot; to T&#39;Challa when he was fighting M&#39;Baku for the throne during challenge day. This gets to show that indeed the Black Panther is the protector of Wakanda and its part of its people."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-04,‚ÄúHis people don‚Äôt call him general or king they call him Kukulkan.‚Äù <br><br>Goosebumps!
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2024-10-11,"Watching October 11, 2024. Its been 2 years since its release but still cant get over with this trailer especially the music."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-11-11,"I just watched this. It&#39;s been just over 4 months since my mum passed. She loved the first Black Panther. This is one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen on a personal, emotional level. Thank you to Ryan Coogler and the team."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Hearing Bemba and Nyanja on a Black Panther trailer is such a huge step for the Zambian music scene. Sampa is really redefining the boundaries.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,We are in tears of joy the whole Zambia is happy  putting our artists to the world using bemba our local language in the soundtrack that&#39;s huge ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠üò≠
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2024-08-17,Whos back just to watch this trailer again because of how good the movie turned out to be
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"Man this is so bittersweet. I know it&#39;s going to be emotional due to Chadwick&#39;s absence, but I believe the rest of the cast is gonna put on an amazing performance for us. Can&#39;t wait to see it!!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"Absolutely beautiful! The music, the visuals, and the dialogue all add up to a great experience. I can&#39;t wait for this emotional rollercoaster of a movie."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-05,"&quot;Death is not the end.&quot;<br>                   -Black Panther<br><br>Rest in peace, king. Wakanda Forever"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-03-08,"Still can&#39;t get over the fact that the song playing in the back ground is front my country,Zambia, even hearing him rap in our language, it&#39;s amazing, ,,,üòçproud Zambian"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I am honestly super pumped for this movie, and I hope they do good and honor chadwick&#39;s legacy"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-20,"This one‚Äôs for you, Chadwick. if only you could be there to see this tribute in your honor! And I‚Äôll say this, It‚Äôs gonna be an emotional roller coaster ride that‚Äôs for sure!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Do you know a great feeling with goose bumps?<br><br>It‚Äôs when you hear your homeland song being used as a soundtrack in Black Panther I mean one of marvel cinematic‚Äôs greatest projects <br><br>Couldn‚Äôt be any less proud being Zambian üáøüá≤üñ§üáøüá≤
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,As a Zambian I&#39;m very proud .Got the chills and all that! My word!!!
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,That tiny detail of the suit absorbing the impact makes me think they paid a ton of attention to the small things and we will get an amazing story. I love continuity
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-07-19,Watching this trailer 9 months later gives me chilssss
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-04,Both the teaser and the trailer are some works of art on their own. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm prepared for how incredible this movie is
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"This is going to be so emotional. I hope marvel delivers what they&#39;re promising, a beautiful, touching, well done movie as T&#39;challa and Chadwick deserves, not a clown show."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-04,Looks amazing as both a tribute to the fallen leader and the resilience to carry on.   Audiences love an emotional connection and it looks like this will deliver!
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-02-01,"R.I.P to the king, black panther &amp; the legend will always be missed im watching this movie and the MCU has done him justice and honored him"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-09,"Chadwick Boseman did something incredible. Not only he embodied a king in the MCU, he glazed this light also in the reality. He shares all the aspects of a King. He shined through humbleness, empathy, wisdom and great leadership. His footprints would be hard to scratch off for a long time."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"The fact that they included Chadwick&#39;s death in the story, and made it a core part of the drama, is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie. We all grief Chadwick, and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief. Hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-05,Literal goosebumps throughout the trailer. Deep sadness that Chadwick couldn‚Äôt be there to carry this forwards but so much love and pride for the mantle he‚Äôs passed on to a new generation. And this film embodies that ‚ù§‚ù§
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-01-07,I loved it so much. Honouring Chadwick Boseman in the best of ways possible. Nothing could have been done better üíØüíØüíØ
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-05,"I think Namor deserves attention as well because he looks epic. He has presence and I love that he doesn&#39;t seem like this factory-manufactured antagonist of recent times. It&#39;s Kingdom vs Kingdom, and the visuals of both cultures and their clash is mesmerizing."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,The short sequence of Ironheart‚Äôs suit looks and sounds amazing. I‚Äôve always appreciated the sound design of the suits when you can clearly hear the components moving and clicking into place. Very exciting
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-11-13,"Letitia I have never seen such a young actor go through so many ranges of emotions so effortlessly. Grief, anger, apathy, empathy and hope. What a performance! The entire cast was so awesome. The memorial to Chadwick Boseman moved me to tears."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-04-07,"I&#39;m not much of a superhero, comic, marvel, DC type of viewer but I absolutely loved every part of this movie. I really should get into this genre haha. Bloody beautiful and those costumes from both sides...OMG, give the designers several awards"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Been a huge fan of Black Panther since I was a small kid. It&#39;s a real happy feeling inside to see great story tellers honoring the story and characters. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman. Long live Queen Shuri.‚ô•Ô∏è
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,I know I am going to bawl my eyes out with the tribute. I&#39;m so glad they were able to make another movie. Based on the trailer it looks like they will do it justice
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Namor swiftly dodging in the air with his foot wings looked so badass tbh
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2025-02-25,"I‚Äôm always a fan of T‚ÄôChalla &amp; Shuri, they‚Äôre both the best Black Panthers of All-Time!!! üêà‚Äç‚¨õ"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Ryan Coogler has this special ability to really elevate the MCU storytelling. The visuals look gorgeous and you can tell Black Panther 2 is going to have a lot of heart to it. Can‚Äôt wait
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I have so many emotions watching this trailer. Part of me is happy for Shuri as the new Black Panther, such a powerful roll but I am also so misty eyed because of the loss of Chadwick. This will be a very powerful movie."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-06,It‚Äôs the music for me <br>You can even feel the goosebumps on your entire body
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-02-05,One of the most beautiful trailers I have seen!
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-11-13,"LOVED the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, which moved me to tears. I felt his presence throughout the movie. Kudos to the production team and cast for keeping his memory alive!"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"I like how even though the movie appears to be mostly serious, it has some of the zaniness of the source material by keeping the wings on Namor‚Äôs ankles. Also that final shot showing Shuri as the new Black Panther sent chills down my spine."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-08,I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of Namor the Submariner. The look Disney gave him in this movie is outstanding. I sincerely love his look.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-01-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=101"">1:41</a> this is the most epic scene in the trailer"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,Namor looks and moves perfectly! So cool to see him realized in a way that doesn&#39;t make him look like a silly joke.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3QKkl1WyM&amp;t=109"">1:49</a> THIS GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS DAMMM BROO"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-04,I&#39;m so ready to see this but at the same time I&#39;m gonna miss Chadwick Boseman so much
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2023-02-09,"&quot;I&#39;m Prince T&#39;challa, son of King T&#39;challa.&quot; I cried"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"This trailer doesn&#39;t have the crescendo ingredient that the teaser has, but is still a chilling and beautiful trailer. No unnecessary jokes or goofy moments, it&#39;s time for a really good and serious movie"
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,I love how there‚Äôs no awkward joke scene after the title card. It shows how important this film is gonna be.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_Z3QKkl1WyM,2022-10-03,"Shuri‚Äôs Panther suit is absolutely beautiful! The gold and silver highlights and the white dots on her face look so good, and make it feel so much like her!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-07,"I love that Nicolas Cage always gives 100 percent. It doesn&#39;t matter if the script is gold or complete crap, he knows how to commit and give it his all."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-10,"Everyone talking about nick cage, but Nicholas Hoult is also a great talent. Loved him in warm bodies and young beast in X-men franchise."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Nicolas and Nicholas. The duo we never knew we needed.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-02-05,"This is a trailer done right. It doesn‚Äôt give away the plot, doesn‚Äôt show you all the best parts and does what it‚Äôs suppose to do which is get you hyped for the film. I wish more trailers did this."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Nicholas Cage as Dracula is one of the best casting choices they ever made.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,What is crazy is he actually looks like he might unironically be a really good Dracula.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This movie is going to be wild no matter how good or bad it is
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-02-03,I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs low budget or high budget. Cage always does a good job acting.    Can‚Äôt wait to see him on top again.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"Nicholas Cage is always Nicholas Cage, and he always deliver. The crazier he is the better everything gets. This is going to be a real treat, and he actually seems to be an awesome Count."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-10,"I love how eating an insect gives him power. In the Bram Stoker book, draculas servant feeds insects to rats and rats to a cat and then eats the cat (or some combination of animals but it starts with insects) bc he says if you eat a creature, you gain it‚Äôs life force. Such a cool way to call back to the original Renfield."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"I always thought Renfield was an underrated character in the book, because there was genuinely depth I felt. But this looks like a fun movie, for sure"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-07-24,"This movie deserves a sequel. Nicholas Cage never disappoints. Good or bad he can cast. What you want him to be, he will be."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"Nick Cage‚Äôs comeback has honestly been great, can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Seeing Nic Cage as Dracula puts a smile on my face
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,I admit I always had a soft spot for Mr. Cage but seeing his entrance as Dracula really made me laugh...in a good way. This could really be fun to watch.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-02-26,"Finally, Nick Cage has a role that is perfect for him. There is no way he can over act this part."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This gonna be fun to watch. Nicolas cage is always at his best when he&#39;s crazy.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,"I&#39;m so excited for this. If you want a Nicholas Cage as a vampire fix until the release of this film, watch The Vampire&#39;s Kiss. It&#39;s an early-career expression of Nicholas Cage being everything you love about Nicholas Cage."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-24,I immediately liked how when he said <br>‚Äúcome on in‚Äù <br>he freaked out because that counted as an invitation to come into the building.<br>Old school vampire lore.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-05,Nicholas Cage or Johnny Depp are the few actors that could pull a role like this off. Both give 110% of themselves into their work.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-13,"Considering the amount of detail original to the book (spider-eating, Vampires having to be invited, etc) this looks like a really smart movie having the time of its life being as dumb-fun as possible and I am here for it."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-10,I love the part where the counselor invites Dracula in and Reinfeld freaks out. Vampires can supposedly only enter if you give them permission.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmO6rmDW08&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> i love the fact that Dracula is an old style vampire which meant he must get invited to be able to get inside a house"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-02-07,"I saw this trailer before a YouTube video and had no idea who was playing Dracula. When Nick Cage showed up, I literally started cheering. Perfect casting choice."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,I love that Niccage embraces his persona in his last few movies.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,I&#39;m running out of words here to explain how excited i am for this movie
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Nic Cage is such a legend and rocking it in underrated films. Love it
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-02,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmO6rmDW08&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> Love how he stops at the threshold because he needs to be invited in!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-09,Nicolas Cage has already proven that he can play a crazy person who thinks they&#39;re a vampire. But to see him play an actual vampire? Absolutely thrilled for this!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,I didnt know I needed a Nicholas Cage Dracula in my life but now that I have it I wont let it go <br><br>This looks batshit insane and I LOVE IT
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"This looks genuinely great, and Nic looks like he&#39;s having a hell of a lot of fun in his role."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-24,Just watched it and it was fantastic. I got to praise both Hoult &amp; Awkwafina&#39;s performance next to Cage&#39;s.. they were amazing! Can&#39;t wait to watch it again.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,The sequel to Vampire‚Äôs Kiss that we never asked for but always needed.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"Someone tell me why this looks like its gonna be good. Like having Nicholas Hoult&#39;s character be main focus, is actually genius."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"This looks incredible! Hoult did so good in Warm Bodies, and Nic Cage is an icon."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-14,A brilliant decision on Nick&#39;s part. He has done a perfect cult classic film at the right time. He is an icon with disregards to his personal life. He is the cream of his era and this is an excellent opportunity to re-establish his A-List status. Bravo Nick.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,This looks incredible
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"I love the fact that Dracula‚Äôs servant got his own movie, still it‚Äôd be funnier if he was compelled to eat bugs as a character tick and not need them for a power up. Also can‚Äôt wait for my favorite chapter of Dracula getting turned into a whole movie too!!!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,Nicholas Cage and John Malkovich. They are a class apart. When they speak it feels like a song. So excited to be able to watch him on the big screen again.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2024-12-04,"I am currently observing the huge impact of this film on global trends: What We Do in the Shadows (toxic lighting), Abigail. Renfield is a truly groundbreaking movie. Among the hundreds of movies that I forget after a week, this one will stay with me forever. I love this neon toxic lighting."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"If you haven‚Äôt seen it, ‚ÄúMom and Dad‚Äù is a taste of how good this is gonna be. Cage is just the guy that needs the right vehicle and he‚Äôll give us a classic."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,My favorite quirk of Dracula was that he needed to be invited into the room to enter. Funny to see them play on this in the meeting scene XD
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"Oh god I never thought I need this duo but now I can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs going to be good or not, I know I will have a great time watching it"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-16,"I haven&#39;t seen Nicholas Cage movie in decades. Read a few reviews and was glad we decided to see this flick. This movie is action packed, gruesome and entertaining."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-12,"I went to a dracula ballet one time, which means no spoken dialogue or singing for those who have never been to a ballet. It&#39;s like interpretive dance. The Renfield in this ballet was quite literally the BEST depiction of the character I have ever seen. The guys was barrel rolling across the stage and just going wild. It&#39;s hard to explain the dance but it was so perfect. <br><br>It&#39;s about time they gave this character a movie of their own, he is by far one of my favorite side characters in any movie. Dracula Dead and Loving It is one of my favorite movies depicting this character so I hope this one is decent. Not too sure how I feel about them giving him super powers though."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-10,"first saw Nicholas Hoult in Skins. He has so much range, it&#39;s incredible, and I think he&#39;s gonna carry this movie. for me, Cage is just the icing on the cake."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,"This looks incredible. I checked it out to see if it&#39;s based on a comic or novel (aside from Dracula) and it&#39;s not, it&#39;s an original idea. I&#39;m also glad to see Nicholas Hoult in something big again. I&#39;m just hyped af!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-28,"When I heard about this movie, I was hoping for a serious, dark, movie with antiquated horror but, I&#39;ll most likely watch it anyway being that Renfield was always one of my favorite characters."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This looks way better than I originally thought it was going to be. Nic Cage makes an awesome Dracula!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,He&#39;s like a more comedic version of Christopher Lee&#39;s Dracula. I&#39;m here for it!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,I couldn&#39;t stop smiling watching this.<br>! I&#39;ve been so excited to see Nic Cage as Dracula since the behind the scenes photos came out months ago!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-14,"Just got out of the theater on opening night at an Alamo Drafthouse movie party. I had low expectations, thinking it would be mildly funny and campy. While it definitely is campy, this is the best movie I‚Äôve seen all year; and I saw John Wick 4 a couple weeks ago. Cage and Hoult (and Awkwafina!) are all amazing!!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-18,"I love the framing of an abusive relationship support group SO MUCH that I want to go out and see this as probably the first movie I&#39;ve seen in a theatre since the pandemic, despite full knowledge that I might annoy everybody by breaking out in hysterical laughter when Dracula does something spooky and all I can think about is him getting mauled by bees."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This feels like the role Nicholas Cage was born to play and he literally played himself in a movie last year.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,Nicholas Cage in horror/comedy movies is badassery right there.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-23,"Nic Cage screaming &quot;I&quot;M A VAMPIRE, I&#39;M A VAMPIRE&quot; in Vampire&#39;s Kiss is one of my fondest memories, and it looks like this film might finally outshine that.<br><br>Also from the writers of Rick and Morty, Community, Invincible and The Walking Dead, and the director of Moral Orel &amp; Lego Batman doing a live action feature. <br>Wow. These guys know how to mix comedy with dark high-concept ideas. I&#39;m excited."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"I wish that Dracula Untold would get a sequel, but I&#39;m interested in this movie as well."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,He‚Äôs ACTUALLY doing the Peter from Vampires Kiss voice and I‚Äôm so dead. Protect Nic Cage at all costs
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"I&#39;m gonna see this movie, it makes Renfield actually look like a hero instead of a sick man locked in a padded cell."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-30,Saw this movie twice in cinema. Can¬¥t get enough of it. N. C. is brilliant.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Nicolas Cage as Dracula is just genius.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This actually looks way more awesome than if anticipated.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-13,Nicholas Hoult usually portrays such weird characters and I love it!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-22,"I&#39;m looking forward to this movie, I&#39;m a die-hard Dracula fan. I find the idea of a Dracula film from Renfield&#39;s point of view fascinating, as Renfield is often a character that&#39;s not normally taken seriously, but in this film it looks like people are actually listening to him properly"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This role was made for Cage and I‚Äôm all for it!!!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,"I was already on board from the trailer, but when I saw that Nicholas Cage was playing Dracula?<br><br>Well, this unironically became my most anticipated film of 2023."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,Trailer lowkey go hard. Giving me &quot;not gonna do well at box office yet will end up a cult classic&quot; vibes
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-05-10,Nicholas Cage is so good here hands down specially his voice and acting is amazing
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Finally! Renfield gets the attention he deserves!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,Finally a movie that makes me want to see it in the theater!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,First Wednesday and now Renfield. Two horror comedies that focuses on one character from the source material.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-08-14,"Just saw the movie now. It was a very fun film. And I agree about N. Gage, he always commit to his roles. Small or big."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,This will be the greatest movie ever
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"Looks really promising, and the eccentric role fits Nicholas Cage perfectly. Can&#39;t wait to see it!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-07,"Beyond the fact that Nicolas Cage got in deep with the IRS, was essentially taking anything and everything he could get to pay it off, most straight to stream or dvd movies.<br><br>He is a very committed and talented actor. It seems the more the more the role is pushed, the better he is. I think this is going to be great actually, looking forward to seeing it."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-08-04,"This was probably the most wacky, bloody and  funny vampire movie since Vampire Sucks üòÇ. I absolutely loved it!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"Can&#39;t wait to see both Nicolas! Everything is definitely connected, Nicolas Cage as the dracula, the nephew of Francis Coppola who made Dracula."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,When i first heard about this movie i was skeptical but after watching the trailer this changed my mind. It looks really good !
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Now this is an interesting and refreshing take on an old story. I&#39;m really excited to see this!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-08,"These are the movies we need more of. I feel like over the last decade the only movies getting the spotlight are all superhero movies. Bring back some good plot, horror, action, practical effects. Cgi/vfx for an entire film is meh nowadays! Can&#39;t wait for this!!!!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"This is going to be great movie. Just like Cocain Bear, Megan, Knock at the Cabin. They have something in common. They are new ideas, embracing old caracters. Not remasters or remakes. Its new, but it uses the old memories, old movies, to caught your attention. With the new ideas this is awesome. Im excited for every movie!"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Anything with Mr cage I&#39;m ready for it  üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,"From being Ghost Rider to becoming Dracula, Johnny almost came to a full circle."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-04-17,"Ok I watched it, don‚Äôt want to spoil it to those who haven‚Äôt,but do want to say this whoever thought of putting Nicolas Cage in dracula‚Äôs role is a Genius‚ù§"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,Nicholas Holt has definitely leaned into comedic roles. And it works!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,Just glad to see Cage back in films again.‚ù§
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,"&quot;okay... Obviously we&#39;re dealing with a little bit more than narcissism here&quot;  no matter how bad this is gonna be, I&#39;m finna watch it."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2024-08-19,"Oscar to Casting<br>Oscar to Acting <br>Oscar to Story<br>Oscar to Music <br>Oscar to Fight choreography<br>Oscar to Gore <br><br>The Best Nicholas cage and Nicholas Hoult movie I&#39;ve ever seen, the genre was awesome, Horror, Gore, Revenge...My God 100/10 to this movie especially the Director‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-11,I wish more people who enjoyed this would read the original Dracula novel by Bram Stoker because it looks and feels like a badass modern retelling of the Dracula story but Cage comes across as a far more sinister and villainous character because he based his performance on Max Schreck&#39;s legendary character of Count Orlok from Nosferatu. I cant wait for this
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,Looks amazing. Definitely can&#39;t wait to c it. Cage has kinda become the master of  turning things into instant cult classics. Especially over the last few years. Definitely excited to c if he can keep it up. Based on this trailer I&#39;m thinking absolutely.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-10,"Dude I love this line. &#39;Okay, obviously we are getting a little bit more than just a narcissism here.&#39; <br>That was dope ü§£."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-26,finally a movie to get the monster universe back on its feet.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-09,Nic Cage and Brendan Frasser came back when we needed them the most.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-06,The one thing we can count on is Nicolas Cage will deliver. He has his whole career.
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-08,"I&#39;m so in love with Nick, he has a great touch to his roles"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-03-22,"I love nicolas cage, because he doesn&#39;t always need to give a daniel day lewis performance. He always finds a way to put 100 percent into his work and entertain his audience. He&#39;s so entertaining to watch."
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-07,"I like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmO6rmDW08&amp;t=114"">1:54</a> part, i think vampire can‚Äôt enter the house if you don‚Äôt invite them in some legend"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-20,"Nicholas Hoult once being a zombie, now a vampire makes me want to watch the movie even more. Maybe the next monster film will have him as a mummy or werewolf ü§î"
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-01-05,It&#39;s like a Dracula movie brought the new era - Renfield. It&#39;s pretty exciting because of Nicolas Cage. Looking forward for this movie soon!
Renfield,6LmO6rmDW08,2023-05-03,"RENFIELD MOVIE IS SIMPLY FANTASTIC !!! I Wasn¬¥t expecting the movie to be that AWESOME !!! It¬¥s gore, It¬¥s funny. It is a great lesson on Narcisisti Behavior and Gaslighiting.  What an unexpected GEM !!! NICOLAS CAGE IS SIMPLY? FANTASTIC!!! What an ALL AROUND ACTOR !!! NICHOLAS HOULT ,....HE GOES JOHN WICK MODE and he is simply FANTASTIC !!! He did it a pen !!! LMAO ! LMAO !!!  Strongly recommennd watching this movie !! IT IS SIMPLY FANTASTIC !!! FANTASTIC !!"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-08-01,Miss Kay does not get enough recognition for what a strong woman she is. She worked so hard to fight for her family and to see Phil saved
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-18,"I‚Äôm trying not to bawl like a baby watching this trailer because I‚Äôm where Ms Kay was, fighting for my marriage. I‚Äôve been fighting for over 8 years and fighting in the spirit for my husband to come back to God. It will all be worth it when God comes through and they are an inspiration to me"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-29,We went to see The Blind last night.  It was INCREDIBLE!  The movie was beautifully written.  The cinematography made me feel as though I was in the Louisiana swamp - BEAUTIFUL!  There was never a dull moment.  Thank you Phil and Kay for allowing your story to be shown.  Thank you Jesus for showing us another way!
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-02,"I read Phil&#39;s book, several years ago and hoped someone would see the potential and üò¢would make it a movie. Kay&#39;s faith is what kept the family intact through the hard times, and she deserves a lot of the credit for what the family is today."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-22,"Oh man, I can‚Äôt wait to see this. I tear up every time I see Phil on his knees and he slams his hand on the ground. I‚Äôve been there my friend. Sometimes the Lord has to get us to a place that we‚Äôll yield and submit to Him. Even in our lowest times, He is faithful."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-21,"This story is very similar to my parent&#39;s story. After my dad lost his family due to partying, drinking and staying gone all the time. I was 4 when my dad finally got it together and started going to church and taking us with him. My parents reconciled and started going to church together and life was pretty good from then on. Thank you Lord for saving my family"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-27,"I‚Äôm not typically someone that enjoys going to watch movies like these, but over the years of hearing bits and pieces of their story I wanted to find out further. I was shocked. I never imagined a movie like this could impact my life that much. I truly thank God for whomever all worked on this film did their best because it showed and I would reccomend to literally everyone!!! I would never turn down watching this movie again either- it‚Äôs that good."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-20,I CAN NOT wait to see this movie!! The Robertsons are such a great family and their story is so inspirational.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-04-01,This was a blessed and beautiful film. Thank you all for choosing to share this. I praise God for this. I pray their strength in the Lord in Jesus&#39; name. I pray that they choose to serve the LORD wholeheartedly as a family unit no matter what IN JESUS&#39; NAME. THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES. AMEN.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-08-29,"My first experience with duck commander was when I was 3; my dad first took me to the duck blind. I was too young to shoot so I was the &quot;designated caller.&quot;<br>We got all the calls I wanted, I watched all VHS tapes of &quot;The Duckmen of Louisiana,&quot; and I had the casettes to play as we drove to the salten sea so I could learn more about the art of calling. Far before Duck Dynasty, I had a strong connection to Phil and the family. And I&#39;m glad Kay and his story is getting told with respect and production value. And one day, I&#39;ll be teaching my daughter how to call just as I did, with the same calls the robertsons always made by hand."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-30,My entire generation needs to see this
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-02-16,"What an amazing movie. I laughed, cried, felt joy, empathy, loneliness, etc. Ya&#39;ll did a phenomenal job telling your story. When we walk with the lord nothing anything is possible! Rest in paradise Mr. Big AL üôè"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-26,"I look forward to supporting a Christian movie. The Robertsons family is one my favorites, they love the Lord and their podcast helps me to learn and grow in my faith."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-03,I am looking so forward to seeing the movie. Have always loved this family. Yes Miss Kay deserves so much recognition for all she did to fight for her family. A strong woman
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-30,I may not be the religious type but i am excited for this movie because like it or not the Robertson&#39;s have had a profound impact on me and taught me values i couldn&#39;t find in my own life.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-29,I just watched this movie last night and being a huge fan of the roberston family and the show and after learning about Phil‚Äôs story of how he found god was so amazing I love this movie and Phil‚Äôs testimony and every actor who played as the family did amazing this film will always imma show to my family
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-01,Just finished watching ‚ÄúThe Blind ‚Äú with family and friends. It definitely is a must see. Loved the way the story was told. Hats off to the folks that made this film happen.

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-10-23,I was in Phil‚Äôs place and I cried when I watched the movie thank God he found me
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-11-15,When i watched this i went ‚Äúthere‚Äôs still hope for Hollywood‚Äù. Such a beautiful story. May God bless them and keep them safe from evil
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-03-27,"I‚Äôm watching this movie üé• right now and I Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it! In fact, I have watched it several times already it so touched my heart ‚ô•Ô∏è. I know this movie üé• was made with lots of love and prayers. Thank you!"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2025-04-07,Can&#39;t wait till YouTube puts it up for free.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-01,"I watch duck Dyasty everyday, I&#39;ve always wanted them to make a move about Phil &amp; Kay so I&#39;m soo happy they did &amp; I can&#39;t wait to see it. Thru the lord anything is possible."

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-16,"Can&#39;t wait!!! God Is Good!! Thank you, Jesusüí´üëë‚úùÔ∏èüíñ"

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-04,My wife and I had the privilege of seeing this movie today. Such a powerful story!
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-07-12,Can‚Äôt wait to see it. Phil Robertson is THE legend that God has blessed us with
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-03,I‚Äôm excited to see this! Praise God for redeeming Phil‚Äôs life and forever changing the history of the Robertson family üôåüèª
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-28,"Never watched Duck Commander, Duck Dynasty, but knew of the Robertson family. I watched an interview with Phil on Glenn Beck a couple of weeks ago and have been obsessed with catching up on this family, currently watching Unashamed. I can&#39;t wait to see this movie."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-14,Can&#39;t wait to see it!!!!! Thank you Robertson family for taking the time out of your day to teach us the good news in computer land.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-19,I am from their area. Phil is an incredible motivator. It‚Äôs going to be nice to see a bit of childhood home on the big screen. Monroe LA
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-26,"I can&#39;t wait to see it! I&#39;ve been listening to Unashamed for years and know Phil&#39;s story well. Ms Kay is a saint! God, keep blessing the Robertson family!"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-08,This family is definitely one of the best I got the opportunity to met Willie and Kori and the were amazing loving people
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-01,Brought my husband tonight to see it. We are struggling in our marriage with his alcohol and sexual addictions. He blames me for it all. We are believers. It is so hard for me to keep this marriage going. I pray we can tell Phil and Kay that they were a tool God had used to make us one again.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-11,I have shared with all my friends! I love your family and cannot wait to see it on the big screen. I have bought several tickets in advance and are asking my friends and family to do the same! Praying for the success of this movie and that lives  may be won for the Lord! To God be the Glory! We love you Robertson family!‚ù§
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-11,"Thank you, God, for blessing such a broken down man and a fearful woman. Your work has done us all a huge favor. It always has, and it always will. The breakthrough is real, and I also thank you for that.<br><br> In your son&#39;s name I pray, Amen."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-21,Can‚Äôt wait to see this! The entire Robertson family is just so good and they are kind people
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-14,I cannot wait to see this movie!!! I love the Robertson Family. I watch Duck Dynasty everyday. They always make me laugh. I just watch rerun after rerun and never get tired of it.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-30,Saw the movie finally and it&#39;s was sad but happy at the end. Beautiful movie I love this family.  Phil is my favorite.  He was lost but God had mercy on him. He had trauma from his childhood but miss Kay never gave up. She was his rock. I love this movie.  ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-04,"Wow, I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie. God is truly using what they have walked through. Just wow. I‚Äôm in awe of God and His glory. I‚Äôm in awe of how they are glorifying Him ‚ù§to anyone out there going through a similar story or situation to this, God is with you too. Through it all. No matter how hard or messy life gets He never leaves us nor abandons us. He is the one true constant if we will let Him be. If we will invite and accept Him to be‚ù§ praying for all of those situations out there. God bless‚ù§"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-07-23,I&#39;m in! When this movie comes out I&#39;ll be watching! I appreciate anyone who share their stories of struggles and how they came out clean.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-23,I will be watching this. Looks like great encouragement for people praying for their family to give their lives to Christ Jesus.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-05-08,I hadn‚Äôt even heard about this movie until today. I bought it right away and watched it. This is the best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2025-01-04,"I watched a man, who, from the day I was born to this day not have his eyes opened by the Lord live a similar life to Mr. Robertson. I prayed and prayed for that man. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in years because it wouldn‚Äôt benefit either of us. As each year passes, it‚Äôs hard not to let those difficult memories fade into the background. The Lord prevailed in other ways and continues to do so. But with those blessings, it can be easy to forget to pray for the people that might not be in front of one‚Äôs face anymore. This movie was a good reminder of that. He hasn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôs lost himself yet and that he needs to be born again through Christ. Please pray that he might turn his life around and follow his Creator. Pray that we might come to a point that we can talk again. This movie helped remind me that Christ is our hope. So if we lose hope in that someone could change, we are really doubting the hope that Christ has given us to change. I will remain where I am, because the Lord has shown me that I cannot change the situation, but it is through His power alone. Like the Father rejoices when His children come home to Him, I will rejoice if He does the same."
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-08-26,I auditioned for this in early 2022 when they were casting. It‚Äôs so cool to finally see a trailer. Can‚Äôt wait to see it. It looks amazing
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-04-05,Wow I already know that this is going to be an amazing movie.  I imagine they have been through high water and hell to get were they are today and they deserve every bit of it.  The &quot;Dynasty&quot; is a very blessed family.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-06-09,"I was looking for a movie to watch, and as always, I read the audience&#39;s comments. It was a toss-up between a few others, but once I read the spiteful comments from the anti-Jesus &#39;faithful&#39;, I knew this was the one I would watch, and what a great choice it was!  I didn&#39;t know what it was about, but what an amazing story!  Strongly recommended for Christians, and an even stronger recommendation to the non-Christians.  Whether you believe it or not, you&#39;re going to meet Him.... Amen!"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-30,This is the best movie I ever seen. Please go watch it.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-12-26,This is me I need God..I would take a beating half my life to be able to watch this movie..I know some will laugh but I live in a rural place that I don&#39;t have streaming or much past youtube on a cell phone
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-30,So excited for this!! I absolutely love the Robertson family and their faith in the Lord!

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-01,"I just saw this. I ugly cried when I got in the car. What a powerful story! God is good. He makes all things new. He can make a way in the wilderness and streams in the desert. <br><br>This story touched me so much because it conveys the need for baptism and the need for us to accept Jesus. He is always knocking but we have to let him in. <br><br>I was dating a guy who was going to church, watching The Chosen and listening to Christian music. He was about to get baptized. Then, the harlet appeared. The enemy temps those who are close to changing their lives. <br><br>So happy for Phil and his family. God is a miracle worker."

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-29,"I can&#39;t wait to see this. I started watching their videos about 29 years ago in college, when I started duck hunting ‚ù§"

The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-03,A great story about Jesus Christ! He is the one that came off the mountain to meet us in our lows. Movie is a 10/10.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-23,Can‚Äùt wait to see this!  Hooray for truth‚Ä¶take NOTE Hollywood üíü‚úùÔ∏è
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-01-17,I dont watch alot of duck dynasty but I still loved this movie and highly recommend it. I already bought it on DVD.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-14,The Duck Dynasty movie we wanted to see.
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-09-06,This is a true story not only for them but for US! All others who turned to Jesus and were given a NEW LIFE!
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-06-27,"I‚Äôm super excited to see this movie, sometimes the lord has to break us to remake us he did it to me I had to be broken to be rebuilt in the lord"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-21,Chills &amp; tears watching this trailer ü©∑
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2023-10-08,"So excited to watch this!! I could care less how they made millions, I‚Äôm excited to see god at work in their life and their love story üòÅ"
The Blind,dE2wUVknVj8,2024-04-07,"This is the.most excited I&#39;ve been for a movie IN YEARS!!! If I didn&#39;t already have a pureflix account, I&#39;d get one just to see this. CANNOT WAIT!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-09-24,It&#39;s nothing short of criminal that we left these interpreters behind. Outstanding movie.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-06,I like that the story is timeless. One person repaying a life debt to another.  Could set this at any point in human history and it would work.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"Jake and his beard, Guy Ritchie and a good supporting cast. Sold."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-07-06,"I served in the Brazilian air force, this film moved me, it reminded me of my father who passed away this year, a debt, a mission, a commitment, a pact."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-20,Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Covenant is the best movie I have seen this year so far. Gripping from the first moment to the last. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim deserve some serious awards for their performances.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"Gotta give Ritchie immense credit to direct a movie every single year, that is no easy thing!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-12,"I‚Äôm also an Interpreter and have corrected so many people when they call me just a translator. Interpretation is different. You‚Äôre not just translating the message, you‚Äôre conveying it, explaining it, connecting the 2 parties so they feel they really are really talking to each other. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-10-06,"Just finished this masterpiece of a movie, honestly 10/10"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-14,As someone who has served... This movie is by far one of the most realistic representations of what it&#39;s really like.<br>One of my all time favourites.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-07,"I think this is a good movie to show how much interpreters did for us in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even if this is some sensationalized story, they put their life on the line for us. Their family&#39;s lives even. People need to understand that these interpreters deserve to be saved."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-10,"This movie was so good i saw it three times. The amount of trust and emotion in this film is unmatched. My mom was a psychiatrist in the VA and said there&#39;s many patients she had that shared the same emotions Jake portrayed in the movie. Never judge, understand why people act a certain way."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-27,This movie easily has to be in one of my BEST watches. The pure talent the director displays here makes this movie a must watch. He makes it so easy for the audience to step in each character&#39;s perspective. And the subtle hints in the dialogues is just pure content. WOW!
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-13,"Its an absolute masterpiece. The movie is painful to watch in the best way possible. No room to walk away to miss any part of the movie.  My husband and I as former marines felt that this movie moved our world to see brutal humanity and nature&#39;s weird ways to love. I could watch this movie a thousand times over. This is a movie that will never get lost in history, everyone should watch."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,Jake Gyllenhaal always kills it and it good to see Anthony Star from the Boys in the big screen. That guy needs more recognition.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-11,"Spectacular acting by Jake and Salim. I and my wife watched it last night and she was gripping me tight at every juncture. Especially in the ending scene, you could easily cry at their helplessness. Thanks to the men and women who do this work for others. I value trust and commitment in relationships. This movie portrays these virtues"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-12-19,"&quot;Actually, Im here to interpret.&quot;  <br>The significance of that line hits."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-06,"It‚Äôs a pity very few know the actual stories this movie is based on, and how  eventually we abandoned and denied help to those who helped us."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-07,Shameful how we treated these guys who were on the frontlines with our troops after they risked it all to keep our guys safe. Respect from Canada to Ritchie and his crew for telling this story.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-16,"For those that have never been to locations like this an interpreter is an important integral part of your unit. Not only for language purposes but for local customary functions too. They deserve massive recognition for the sacrifices they make. As a three tour infantry veteran my issue is with the military machine itself, mostly the US government. They put a lot of people in harms way ,to satisfy their need for power and money!!!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-10-10,"I&#39;ve never cried this much in any movie, favorite movie of all time"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-03-16,There is nothing so pure than sticking to a vow and fulfilling it.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-26,"Dar Salim gives a career-making performance in this film. It is powerful, important, &amp; deserves to be seen."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-03,"Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the greatest actors working in Hollywood, and the fact that he has one Oscar nomination with no wins is a CRIME! &quot;Prisoners.&quot; &quot;Nocturnal Animals.&quot; &quot;Nightcrawler.&quot; &quot;Zodiac.&quot; All of those roles at the very least deserved nominations. He&#39;s one of the most versatile actors I&#39;ve ever seen! <br><br>He&#39;s up there with Christian Bale, in my book, but at least Christian has an Oscar and multiple nominations."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-10-31,one of the greatest movies i have ever watched.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-24,Saw this movie earlier  today . Personally it‚Äôs an important for people to go see . I highly recommend for people to go see this while it‚Äôs still in theatres . Well acted and well written. Guy Ritchie is a great director
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-27,"My wife &amp; I went to the theaters to watch this movie yesterday. One of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen, the ending is emotional. If you guys can go and watch it while it‚Äôs on theaters, you guys won‚Äôt regret it"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-29,Just watched this movie here in Chicago. Only 4 other ppl in the movie room.. i cried ‚Ä¶ every American should watch this movie and remember these brave souls
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-09-17,No doubt that it was one of the best and emotional movies I ever watched in my almost 40 years in this planet.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-23,Dar salim and Jake.. they are amazing throughout the movie! I cried with my heart thumping hard almost every time
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-23,"This movie left me feeling heavy and sad, which I believe was intentional. The sacrifices of the interpreters that work with our military requires courage that is unmatched. There was so much tension and weight in my heart after having watched it!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"I&#39;m a Ritchie fan, so I&#39;ll be catching this one. Looks a little different to his usual, but I bet he knocks it out of the park."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2024-11-29,"My dad was an interpreter in Afghanistan, he used to work with the United States embassy for about 5 years and we finally got out of Afghanistan with the United States air force üíî it was a tough decision for  all of us, but I‚Äôm glad that we got out soon, because Talibans are now looking for people who were in former military service or those who helped American or any foreign military service in Afghanistan. This is a masterpiece I loved it, it actually did cover a lot of important obstacles that we overcome üíî! Thank you for showing it!!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-10,"Great movie about men&#39;s friendship and commitment. No bs, no agenda. Loved it. Even without much dialogues between the two, you can feel the chemistry between them."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-03-12,"There&#39;s a recent article I read about Guy Ritchie and how obsessed he is with the stories/lore/hospitality of the Middle East and how he literally stays living in that region, granted safe countries such as Gulf secure ones such as Emirates, and how he plans on making more films from there. <br><br>Expect him to make more like this is what I&#39;m trying to say I guess"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-06,"Now this is what I&#39;m talking about! A proper director, making a proper movie with a proper producer, a proper financer and proper actors! Thank you. Can&#39;t wait!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-06-08,"Watched this with my wife and this emotional rollercoaster kept us on the edge, what a true masterpiece üíØ"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-23,I have worked for a year with the US Army in Kabul Afghanistan as an interpreter. I have great memories. Few US allies helped my family to evacuate to the US. I really appreciate and I and my family won&#39;t forget it. Thank you for your service soldiers
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-21,"Saw this movie in theaters, one of the best I have seen in a while. We need to take responsibility for ALL our soldiers out there."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-23,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING. WORTHY OF ACADEMY ATTENTION. Saw it with my mom and she CRIED at the end. Everyone should watch this movie!!!!!!!!!! Great job Jake and Dar ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-10-14,"A powerful, moving story featuring  great actors, director, and a amazing storyline. It also shows friendship, promise-keeping, and sacarafice. It also shows the reality of situations soldiers and interpreters went through in Afghanistan and other countries."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-28,"I was skeptical about this movie but never had I ever sat in a movie theatre where I was on the edge of my seat until today. I‚Äôve just came back from watching this with my family and I gotta say, this is an absolute masterpiece!!! It really tugs my heart just thinking of the many other interpreters and those that helped us weren‚Äôt so lucky. Man after this movie, I‚Äôm never going to look at the world the same way again. In a good way of course! <br><br>If you‚Äôre looking into rotten tomatoes or reviews from other YouTubers, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie! You will not regret it!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-01,Saw this yesterday with my 15 year old son.  He said it was the best movie he had ever seen.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-03,Every time a see the phrase &quot;the academy award nominee Jake Gyllenhaal&quot; I think this brilliant actor hasn&#39;t been nominated enough. He&#39;s so talented and versatile
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2024-01-09,1000/10 I‚Äôve watched this film about 5 times now. Absolutely love this film. Richie and the acting crew did such a fantastic job.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,Happy to see Antony Starr in the big screen!
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-06,"Guy Ritchie is killing it, one movie per year. That&#39;s crazy"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-21,Bout time my boy Guy puts out something worthy of the Academy&#39;s attention. Give this man an Oscar already!
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-09-02,"By far this movie is the best film I&#39;ve seen in the last 3 years. Of all military movies out there, it easily makes the top three. Thanks to everyone who played part in the making üôè"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-29,"Everything is done just right, the story, the acting, the screen. This is kind of things you would like to give a tip for what it deserve"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-23,Another amazing movie of  Jake ! Its must watch def worth it! Also Dar Salim Lets not forget to give him credit. Thank you all soldiers and to your family for all your sacrifices! You deserve so much better than this world we are in right now and I pray you find strength and peace . üôèüèª
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,This looks good. Solid story line. Someone give Scott Adkins a movie that has a solid story too already
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2025-02-06,Honestly one of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen... I couldn&#39;t fall asleep for a couple of hours after watching it.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-24,This is the most incredible movie that I have ever seen in my entire life. I loved it tremendously. It shows the beautiful value of a true human being from every aspect of life. especially that it is based on a true history. There is no word to praise this excellent movie.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-21,"Excellent movie. Not only is this a great story with outstanding acting and action, it speaks of the importance of a covenant. So many people have forgotten that and so many governments have also forgotten the importance of following through on your word. Loved this movie."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-09,"Seeing Jake in the army again reminded of Jarhead, what a masterpiece"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2025-01-12,"Don‚Äôt waste your time here in comments, just play the movie and enjoy one of the best movies in last 10 years"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-04,"Guy Ritchie&#39;s slick comedy/dramas are some of my all-time favorites, but his serious films are on a completely different level. If this is even half as good as Revolver or Wrath of Man, we&#39;ve got a winner on our hands."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-09,"I was an interpreter for few years, in combat time, I didn&#39;t drag wounded solders across the mountains but I would like to think that I did a good job! am excited to watch this move"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-04,"This movie was amazing! I left the theatre still in shock by what I watched, I hadnt heard of the movie.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  So emotional! Thank you for making me aware of what our interpreters had to sacrifice to help us.  God Bless them"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-06-10,"By the end of the movie, I found myself moved to tears."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-03,This looks really good! I&#39;m stoked to see Antony Starr (Homelander) making his way into a high-profile movie like this too.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-29,"This movie hit home to me and it will hit home for many of my fellow Marine warriors, who understand the sacrifices that these interpreters made for us, and for  our country!!!  Semper Fidelis‚Ä¶"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-22,The musical score on this trailer tho!!!!!!! HEAT!
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-03-12,"This is a complete set of live action, drama, brotherhood, and you mention it. Outstandingly remarkable."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-08,"I love these kinds of grounded movies where the story is focused on two central characters, a breath of fresh air from the convoluted save the world movies."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-18,"Just wow , that bond, friendship and belief. I cried , this what we call someone brother from another mother. Hat&#39;s off üéâ"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2024-05-09,"This movie had me on edge the entire time.  Beautiful easy to follow storyline.  Brilliant acting.  Beautifully shot.  This is the best movie i&#39;ve seen in years and my friend, I watch ALOT of movies.  Blown away by this one."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"Ritchie has been on an absolute tear lately. Him and Gyllenhaal have to make for a great one! The only thing that scares me is this trailer gives away way too much, and movies that do that in a trailer always end up being mediocre."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-23,Just saw the movie with my dad and all I have to saw is wow. Amazing performance by the cast
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,I wish trailers would last 35 to 40 seconds long...this showed the whole movie
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-06-23,Absolutely loved it 100%. Casting was on point! Can even become a series I won&#39;t be mad.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-29,"Absolutely outstanding!! These are important stories to share/tell. We all need to see and learn the value of saving, helping, loyalty, honor, and just being an all around good  human doing what‚Äôs right regardless. Love it! It will bring a tear to your eye that‚Äôs for sure. I hope everyone goes to see this movie. ‚ù§"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"Okay this a break of form from Richie, but this looks solid.<br><br>I‚Äôll definitely give it a look in theatres!"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-03-14,Guy Ritchie is fantastic. Never disappoints - What a talent.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-10-06,Hands down the best movie this year we need real cinema back like these are the type of movies Hollywood needs to make with real storylines and emotions
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-07,"I saw this movie and man, it was awesome!!! Great story line, doesn&#39;t start off to slow, lots of action, and definitely kept us on the edge of our seat. It&#39;s definitely one of the better movies I&#39;ve seen in a while, and I think right now it&#39;s super underrated. This movie, in my opinion,  was way better than top gun, but top gun gained way more attention."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-16,"Excellent movie! The first hour will leave you on the edge of your seat, as well as the end.  Soundtrack is superb, and great acting by Jake and Dar.  Highly recommended viewing."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,Guy Ritchie has got to be a candidate for directing the next James Bond entry.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-07-04,"Just watched this‚Ä¶. WOW!!! <br>That has got to be one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a very long time‚Ä¶. Absolutely brilliant cast, acting, writing, emotional investment in the characters !! More of this please."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,Jake Gyllenhaal + Untipical Guy Ritchie = Ready üëÄ üî•üî•üî•
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-03,"So, the world will be introduced to Dar Salim, a brilliant actorüëç"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-01,"I&#39;ve just came back from cinema, it was incredible, all of you must see this film. ‚ù§"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-07-04,"Just finished watching this movie and without a doubt, it&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve watched this year. The action, the acting, the emotions, the directing, the film score, all of it was just fantastic and excellent. Something about this movie was very REAL about the way military stories and events happen. I don&#39;t know but inside of me, i feel this movie deserves an award, whether Oscar, Acadamy or Golden Globe. Just give them the credit that they&#39;re due"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-07-18,"I only watched this movie today.  And all i can say is I&#39;m definitely going to watch it again and again. I  loved it, all of it."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2024-02-27,I remember these day back then we couldn‚Äôt pronounce are interpreter name we called him Andy he was awesome I‚Äôm glad to say he now lives in New York as of 2012 and own 2 news stands also multiple food carts I‚Äôm see him yearly
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-20,"Dar Salim is already one of the biggest actors in Denmark, hopefully this movie will throw his name across to the world."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-12-16,"When I read the stats at the end of the movie, it was difficult not to remember and tear up.<br>I was not sure about this, even though I love Ritchie and Jake.<br>But how Salim brought his character to life made it go from really good to great. If you haven&#39;t watched it, go do it. If you&#39;ve served, it&#39;s difficult, but incredible. Fantastic movie. üíØ"
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,Freaking Homelander with Gyllenhaal...?!!!<br><br>Sign me up.....
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-04-12,Crying like a baby just from the previews. Definitely on my to see list.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-11-27,Dar Salim is an awesome actor <br>He stole the show in my view <br>Impeccable acting skills üòä<br><br>Hand on heart ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>Best film I‚Äôve watched this year üòä
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-08-04,"What a movie ! I am not the kind of person who would comment on a movie, although I watch alot of movies. But this one, was something which has touched my heart. Good job guy Ritchie."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-02,"You had me with the Jake gyllenhaal... Original story, cast and acting the emotions..."
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-29,Respect to the many who work to &#39;interpret&#39; in hard times and places for difficult people.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-02-06,I am a simple person: I see a Guy Ritchie as a director - I instantly add the movie to watchlist. I love everything about his directing style and vision.
The Covenant,02PPMPArNEQ,2023-05-05,"Saw it last night, 10/10. Super impressed, blown away and at the edge of my seat majority of the time. I don&#39;t think I blinked, it was that good"

The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Iko Uwais and his work in The Raid movies with martial arts is simply incredible and seeing him in this movie is enough for a ticket purchase
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,"The Expendables is such a great franchise. Nobody is expecting anything Oscar worthy or groundbreaking. Just a bunch of likable, recognizable faces kicking ass and cracking jokes."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,It‚Äôs amazing how Sylvester Stallone is 76 years old and STILL a badass. üôÇ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2024-03-07,"The Rock, John Cena, Keanu Reeves, Dave Bautista, Chris Hemsworth &amp; Idris Elba All Need To Join Sylvester Stallone &amp; Jason Statham Cast in ‚ÄúThe Expendables 5‚Äù Movie!!üî•üçøüé¨üé•"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa are epic additions to the franchise!!! Hope they can be utilized to their fullest üí•üí•üí•
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,"I need more Iko Uwais in movies - we need more people who know how to fight on the big screen, its always a joy to watch"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,"Expendables are the type of movie that i can just relax with. Just sit down, not too much thinking, just action and humor."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-12-05,"Glad to see Tony Jaa in action again and as always, Jason Statham doin&#39; what he does! He&#39;s soooo likeable and lovable, i ‚ù§ his smile!!"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,"For those who were wondering, the reason why Terry crews is not in Expendables 4 is because the producer told him to drop the sexual assault case against Adam Venit and he refused and left the film."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,Whenever Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa are involved you just know that it&#39;s going to be a movie like no other. üî•
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Still missing expendables 1 cast they are gems ‚ù§
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-09-25,The cgi in this movie reminded me of an old command and conquer cut sceneüòÇ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,"76 years. That is the age of Sylvester Stallone, 76 years, let that sink inn for a moment. To be actually making action movies at that age is one thing , doing it looking the way he does a whole another. To have that muscle mass &amp; physique at that age is quite remarkable. We should all take a moment to truly appreciate  Stallone&#39;s greatness and acknowledge that which  made it all possible, HGH, you are the teams real MVP, thank you"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,Finally after 9 years we get an Expendables 4. Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa are epic additions to the franchise
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,I never get tired of Jason Statham !
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-11-13,Saw it today. Whoever was in charge of writing and greenlighting the script needs to never work in this industry again. All the actors deserve Oscars for managing to shoot takes while remaining in character and not bursting into laughter or tears.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Ong Bak and The Raid are incredible action films. So adding stars Tony Jaa &amp; Iko Uwais from the said films are massive wins
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,"People forget how legendary Tony Jaa is as an acrobatic martial artist. Still, nothing drops my draw like half the scenes in Protector and Ong Bak. Seeing him run up a glass wall and perform Muy Thai on hundreds on gangsters still blows my mind. He&#39;s probably one of the most talented martial artists to date in cinema. Expendables is cool and all, but gun action and big explosions still don&#39;t measure up to good fight choreography and real stunts. Sucks Jackie Chan isnt&#39; in on this, but he&#39;s still one of the all-time greats."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-09-27,Megan Fox just came in the movie just for fuck with Jason Statham üòÇ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Jason Statham vs Iko Uwais will be an epic battle in action history!!!!
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,"Good to see Tony Jaa and Iko Uwais getting more recognition in the West, let alone be in the same movie. Awesome!"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-09-26,"Just went to see Ex4 . Full of action , a few twists and turns and a shock . Looks CGI compared to the other Expendables films . Still a good action flick"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Just give Tony Jaa and Iko a 2 hour fight scene and I&#39;ll watch it
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-08-08,The great thing about the Expendable franchise is that it doesn&#39;t ever have to die. There&#39;s always going to be action stars past their prime to do these movies.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2024-02-09,"For the first time, I can honestly say that the Expendables have become TRULY Expendable"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,"Can I be the one to say that I love 50cents acting career. He just wants to make action movies and have fun doing it, even if his acting isnt always the greatest i respect him for just having some fun by doing them."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-15,"These old school type of action films hold a special place in my heart, cos there‚Äôll be a time when they don‚Äôt exist anymore. Newer ‚Äúaction‚Äù films try to be too deep and poetic, the expendables franchise is just good ol‚Äô ass-kicking and badassery, and that‚Äôs all it needs to be."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,"The Raid movies, Ong-Bak and Warrior King are 4 of the best martial arts movies ever made imo. Iko and Tony&#39;s addition to this movie alone make it a must see."
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-10-06,Can never go wrong with an all star cast. Loved this franchise since the first movie in 2010
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-12,Good to see Iko Uwais branching out. The Raid 2 is my favorite action movie of all time.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-10,Finally good to see Jason Statham have a franchise lead role. Man deserves it.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,"Whenever there is a movie with Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, you know damn well the movie is going to be an absolutely epic win!"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2025-03-06,The trailer is much better than the movie
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,Iko Uwais was meant for these kind of movies. He did pretty good with the Raid movie which i find it so underrated. His martial arts skills is second to none. Honourable mention also to Tony Jaa for his action sequences in Xander Cage. These two are just something else. Can&#39;t wait for this movie.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,"Hats off Stallone, the greatest action superstar!! Statham, Iko, Tony. . This is going to be awesome!"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,Alright guys so we&#39;ve got Tony Jaa and Iko Uwais in the film so let&#39;s make sure we give the majority of the fight scenes to Megan Fox.

The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-07-04,Love that Stallone keeping his movies alive with his friends man. That&#39;s how you do it. Love all these guys.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-10,So happy to see 50 Cent acting again.
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,The fact that in real life Jason is with Rosie who replaced Megan in Transformers is just phenomenal üòÇ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-11-18,"The movie was great! The best thing I have ever seen! And I have all four movies. 50 Cent was great, all the men and women were great, and my favorite was Barney. I hope they continue making more expendable films. I hope all the original and new characters come back."

The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-10-01,"I think is win win solution. Iko uwais and tony jaa get their chance, and the PH get the money. Because Indonesian is the one of fanatic fans when their actors play in good movies. Congrats üéâ"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,As a day one 50cent fan<br> I approve this trailer ü§ùüèΩüëèüèΩ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-18,Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa being in same movie usually means amazing choreography for the fights
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-09,I want to see 50 do more action. And is anybody else amazed he hasn&#39;t aged AT ALL?! üòÇ
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2024-01-04,The original expendables is so awesome but this movie is awesome too
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-08,When Sylvester Stallone said ‚Äúover family‚Äù that‚Äôs when Vin Diesel should‚Äôve showed up

The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-07,"I hope we get a cameo from Jet Li! His health has improved a lot. He wouldn&#39;t even have to fight to make me happy. Pop in for one scene, maybe as an after credit scene!"
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-06-12,Iko Uwais &amp; Tony Jaa with the all time celebrities is like having the new Jackie Chan and Jet Li in American movies we need to see more with them in future films as with no wires and real fights will bring more than box office
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-08-19,So glad this franchise is bringing back the 80s &amp; 90s style action movies! Such an awesome forgotten genre ü•≤
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2024-04-28,I‚Äôll be watching purely for Stallone and 50 ‚ù§
The Expendables 4,DhlaBO-SwVE,2023-07-11,"This is truly an amazing year for action movies. We&#39;ve got John Wick 4, Mission: Impossible 7 (Part 1), Extraction 2, Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Covenant, Fast X, and now The Expend4bles. The title might be stupid, but this movie looks awesome!"

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-02-13,This movie trailer feels like a 2005-2010 Era of movies. Love the vibe.
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-02-23,"This looks like it could be a legitimately good movie. It doesnt look to be pandering, or meant to make you feel bad because of their difficulties. It treats them as people and Woody Harrelson, was an excellent choice!"
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-07,"I&#39;ve been a volunteer hockey coach for the last 5 years now.  Been working with kids anywhere from 6-10, and a few of them throughout the years have been on the spectrum or some other behavioral ticks.  I am very much looking forward to this movie."
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-05,"I saw the original Spanish film &quot;Campeones&quot; at the Palm Springs Film Festival in 2019.  It was WAY better (funny and heartwarming) than it had any right to be.  Even though this pretty much looks like a shot-for-shot remake, I&#39;m definitely down to seeing another version of it again, especially with Woody."

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-29,"How proud I am as a Spaniard, that one of the most emotional films of Spanish Cinema, Campeones, has a remake in the US. üòÄ  <br>The original film is going to have a sequel this coming year, Campeones 2. <br>Next year of course I will see this remake and the sequel to the original movie."

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-06,My friend Joshua Felder has a role in this movie. I&#39;m definitely seeing this in theaters.
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-03-15,I love that this movie doesn‚Äôt try to make you feel bad for the characters with special needs. They don‚Äôt need pity from people.
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-06,This is a remake of the Spanish film &quot;Campeones&quot; ( Champions ) which is a super hilarious film..hope this one can deliver at least at the same level of funny + heart that the original had
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-05,so proud of Josh and Madison! this look amazing!
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-06,"I am Spanish and I saw the original film and clearly the comparisons are going to be hateful.<br>But even so, I&#39;ll give this remake a chance and I&#39;ll go see it when it&#39;s released in Spain"

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-03-06,"Just saw an earlier preview in London, England and the film absolutely delivers. This is a throw back to classic quirky comedy from the 00s which is long overdue. I didn‚Äôt realise Bobby Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers was involved in the film. Excelling casting and laughs and some touching moments too. Go see it in your theater. You won‚Äôt be disappointed üçøüòÑ"

I needed it badly @WoodyHarrelson and all in the  movie    it may have just saved me months ago and it happens to be the most uplifting movie for me.

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-03-29,Woody is the man - his dry wit and a good script could easily be the difference between this and a Hallmark movie.

Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-05,This looks awesome!!
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-01-29,Omg!  This looks funny as hell.<br>Sooo awesome to always see movies like this that depict those with disabilities in a positive way.<br>Having worked with those with intellectual disabilities for years this had to be a riot to film.
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2022-12-05,Ok- the cast looks really great
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-02-28,Jus watched this and it‚Äôs such a good movie. Surprisingly funny too!
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2024-02-25,Enjoyed watching this movie. It proved that with a movie does not need big stars to be that good.
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-03-15,Fun film! Nice to watch at the end of a long stressful day
Champions,pCHiWnj5Oek,2023-03-29,10/10  gut busting and genuine..  what movies need to become again!! <br><br>Hollyweird woken is broken..
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,I just want Jeremy Allen White to be cast as a character with a stable family life.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-12,"For anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen this magnificent film yet, please don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking you have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this one. This is a deeply emotional story about brotherhood and loss. In a world where biopics have been deeply oversaturated, this is one of the best ones made in recent years."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,Somebody needs to give Zac that He-man role ASAP.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-03-27,I have 3 teen boys‚Ä¶ they saw this movie together when it first came out and it has changed their relationship. It has always been good but it became even better.  It made them realize how much they love each other and that life is short and anything can happen so value and love on each other for as long as we have.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-11-09,"WOW.. The way they made it look like the actual Sportatorium.. The ring, the arena.. the outside sign.. Unbelievable. You can tell whoever made this movie really cared about it."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-23,"Just saw it. And you have to hand it to Zac Efron, he totally was immersed in his part, and he was actually pretty brilliant. He is a serious actor and I look forward to seeing what he‚Äôs gonna do next."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,Feels so odd being so hyped for a movie that is going to be very depresssing
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-03-12,Why didn‚Äôt this movie get more recognition?!  Fantastic.  This deserved an Oscar!  Powerful.  Zac Efron is brilliant.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-26,"I grew up in Burleson, Texas in the 70s and 80s. I can tell you with 100% certainty, the Von Erichs were god-like there. Whoever is picking the material for A24 deserves a promotion. This is going to be heavy ... whether you know their story or not."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-03,Zac Efron is really (pleasantly) surprising me with his choices the past few years. This juicy role will give his acting talent a real chance to shine again. I hope he‚Äôs  properly recognized for it
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-06,"Saw it with wife.   Cried and held hands walking out after the credits.  This movie needs more press.  The box office numbers at 18 million, if accurate, are not giving this film justice.  I&#39;m not a wrestling person, but a human.  This human story is just immensely powerful.  You will remember this emotional roller-coaster for awhile.  You will want to hug your family members after this, your kids, your spouse.   Your lover."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-04-03,"Just came back from watching this. Did not think this film would emotionally break me. It&#39;s been a long time since a movie has punched me this hard. The greatest tragedy was how much love these brothers had for each other. They loved each other more than life itself. Zac Efron, made me a believer. The man can act. Through out the film, the greatest feat he had in acting was the amount of emotion and rage he had... hiding under his face. Through out the film while he didn&#39;t say anything underneath, you saw the pain of all the devastation that was happening around him. All he wanted more than anything... was to spend time with his brothers."

The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-14,A24 does better quality movies than 90% from all other Hollywood entertainment companies.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,Kinda crazy how zac efron was pretty much the only one to be super successful in the movie industry out of all the cast of high school musical. Insanely talented. Kudos to him.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-08-15,As a 52yr old man I still remember as a kid LOVING the Von Erich brothers... and then one day they all just stopped being on TV.  I never knew why... üò≠
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-15,"I was 17 and worked security for Will Rodgers Coliseum in Fort Worth where they wrestled every Monday night. The Von Erichs were our heroes. It was like walking next to Superman. It was my job for a time to carry the wrestler&#39;s clothes and props to the back. I would even get to help a wrestler from time to time. I got to appear in the opening (3 seconds.lol) of the Highlander movie. It was a magic. I was the kid that got to carry Superman&#39;s cape. Thank you, Von Erichs."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-23,It‚Äôs a sin that this movie didn‚Äôt get any Oscar nominations. Zac absolutely deserved one.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-17,‚ÄúI used to have 4 four brothers now I‚Äôm no longer a brother.‚Äù<br>-Kevin Von Erich üò¢
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-28,"So impressed by this movie - it took me back to the times. I grew up watching this bunch. Im born and raised Texan - I am saddened and yet so proud. Thank y&#39;all, for representing and entertaining us. You, your family still make Texas Proud. God Bless"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,"If you&#39;ve never heard of the Von Erich family, I suggest looking into their story before seeing this film if you&#39;re faint of heart because it&#39;s legit one of the most gut wrenching and tragic stories you&#39;ll ever read. Just be prepared if you plan on seeing this."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"I just learned about the Von Erich family and the tragedies that they have endured over the years, this film is gonna hit me so hard. The cast looks incredible. Can‚Äôt wait to watch the film!"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-02,"Just saw this yesterday. I‚Äôm still processing my emotions, this is a film that is going to linger on your heart and mind for long time. It was so well done, so well casted. I had no idea what I was walking into but I‚Äôm glad I saw it, probably the best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long while."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-25,"I&#39;m 53, I would sit in front of our TV and watch every Von Erich entrance. Seemed those days would last forever. I loved these brothers."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-02-18,Just finished it. As a middle child with 3 brothers who aren‚Äôt in my life anymore‚Ä¶ this movie broke me. 10/10 amazing film.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,A24 killing it AGAIN. This looks phenomenal. As a pro wrestling fan I‚Äôve been waiting so long for a movie like this. Hope it wins an Oscar.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-11-22,i really love that shot at the start where hes going back and forth between the ropes. that building of tension is incredible.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-20,Just saw this movie and went in blind just thinking it was gonna be an action sports movie. Was not ready for the story that unfolded. Such an emotional rollercoaster that I was not anticipating at all. Amazing film my goodness üò≠
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"For wrestling fans we know just how hard this is gonna hit<br><br>For non-wrestling fans, oh boy get ready‚Ä¶"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"Along with 2008‚Äôs The Wrestler, seeing what these performers go through and the sacrifices they make in the name of entertainment is something. I hope by watching movies like this, people begin to respect these athletes. <br><br>I‚Äôm stoked for this one."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,‚ÄúOnce I had five brothers and now I‚Äôm not even a brother‚Äù the saddest quote I‚Äôve even heard
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-02,Zac‚Äôs best role to date. He definitely deserved heavy consideration for an Oscar this role. Soul touching movie &amp; performance üí™üèæüî•üôèüèæü•≤
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-19,"As a huge old-school wrestling and Kerry Von Erich fan, I&#39;m so excited for this movie. It looks so well made and I know how tragic the cursed life of the Von Erich&#39;s was, so this will make for a deep and powerful rollercoaster of a film."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,So happy for Zac
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-15,"Went to the theaters on a whim and saw this movie with no clue what it was about, not a wrestling fan or anything, didn‚Äôt know about this family‚Ä¶ one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a long time!"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-04,"Incredible movie. The whole movie, you could feel the heavy, emotional, unbreakable bond and love these brothers had for one another. So tragic, but what an awesome ending with Kevins whole family coming to their ranch."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-02-25,‚ÄúI used to be a brother. And now I‚Äôm not a brother anymore.‚Äù<br><br>Zac Efron ROBBED of a nomination.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-20,"For the VERY FIRST TIME in my life, I have a movie that I can see in the theater with my Uncle who introduced me to wrestling in 1991 when I was just 4 years old. He always told me stories about the Von Erichs and the Fabulous Freebirds rivalry and now after 32 years, we finally have our own movie to go see together and his health is on the decline pretty badly so I‚Äôm very happy to be able to share this moment with him. üôèüôèüôè"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"I was already hyped for the cast, but Holt McCallany as the Dad made this a must-see for me! I miss Mindhunter so much!"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-04-07,"Right after I was born October 18, 1980, my mom and dad, with my 3 older brothers met the Von Erich&#39;s, ALL OF THEM at DFW airport after they had fun at Six Flags in Arlington. We headed back to San Antonio. We took a picture with them. It&#39;s in the archives somewhere, but we did that. They became my favorite wrestling family after that. Kevin &amp; Kerry were mine. We&#39;ve had a lot of Iconic entertainers in Texas history in my lifetime die or be killed WAAY TOO YOUNG, but I&#39;m glad they existed at least for me to grow up seeing them. RIP Kingsüëë &amp; Queensüëë"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-30,My best friend and I went to go see this last night and we were both absolutely blown away. It&#39;s heartbreakingly sad and beautifully made. The acting was very good and kept our attention the entire time. Zac was beyond brillant as Kevin. The whole cast was gold üéâ
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,"This movie is going to be one of the most tragic wrestling stories to be shown for big audiences. As a wrestling superfan, the von Erich story is not about a curse, it&#39;s just about the unity of brothers who got into the wrestling business by a legendary but tough father who controlled them and broke them down to turn them into wrestling superstars in Texas, for WCCW (World Class Championship Wrestling). I hope that the story will be very truthful and respectful to the Von Erichs, but show the actual horrible truth about their struggles with depression, drug addiction, and just breaking their bodies and minds to keep WCCW successful by their father, but soon with all of it, all the brothers, except for Kevin, would be dead by their own addiction or by their own hands due to what they went through. So far, the movie looks good, Zac Efron looks a bit weird cast for Kevin Von Erich, but to be honest, movies shouldn&#39;t cast people for looks, but only for their acting chops, so I just hope Zac will do Kevin Von Erich right, but everyone else looks good enough for their respected roles. I&#39;m praying that the movie is great because I think Wrestling should be told more in Movies, like what the wrestler was or now The Iron Claw, I think the wrestling business is very dramatic and eventful for a movie, but yet has very awful, tragic stories that could be a good portrayal for a movie. I hope it does well."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-02,"Just got out of the movie theatre‚Ä¶.<br><br>I‚Äôm speechless. This is one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen and I mean that. What an amazing story, messages, cinematography, soundtrack, artistic lens, and emotional rollercoaster!  <br><br>12/10 Hands down üôåüèΩüò≠üíØüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-20,Just saw this masterpiece.. woah credit to Zac Efron you&#39;re a hell of a guy and future legend IMO! Jeremy Allen White and Harris Dickinson did a really good job too
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-20,There&#39;s just something about A24 films that really draw my attention. It&#39;s not simply the pure\raw ideas and adaptions but the video quality of it all. Truly something pure and magnificent. I legit wouldn&#39;t have a second thought if they had their own streaming service no matter the cost.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-02-23,"One of get best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. No spoilers, but the monologue/scene at the end with his two sons when they were wrestling in the grass had me sobbing. Zac Efron is pure talent."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-23,I just left the theater. This movie was excellent! I can‚Äôt remember the last time I shed a tear while watching a film.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2025-03-29,‚ÄúWhat do you want in life? <br><br>‚ÄúMore ribs. I want to be with my family. You know be with my brothers.‚Äù
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-28,"Just saw this in the theater and lemme tell ya: if ever you&#39;ve seen a trailer and wondered if it lived up to the actual film, this is the one. It&#39;ll be a crime against humanity if no one gets a major award from this. It really is that good."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"Holy shit he actually became the &quot;the bear&quot;, he looks HUGE"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,"Dude, give a raise to whoever put this trailer together ! This was phenomenal! Hyped for this movie."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-30,Saddest movie I&#39;ve seen in years. Excellent job from the actors.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-03-01,I saw Kerry Von Erich wrestle when I was 6 yrs old.  The NWA came to my tiny hometown and put on a show at our high schools football field.  Still remember it 40 yrs later.  These guys were legendary.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-16,One of the most gifted and talented families in the history of wrestling. A story which needs to be told and will do extreme justice to the name.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,I‚Äôm a kid of the 80s and I remember them ‚Äì they were huge ‚Äì they‚Äôre still talked about as being some of the best. There‚Äôs only one of them left now ‚Äì terrible tragedy hit that family. I can‚Äôt wait to see this.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-11-24,The fact that Zac Efron wasn&#39;t nominated for an Oscar is criminal
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"Once i heard &quot;People said our family was cursed&quot;, I knew it about the Von Erichs! One of the saddest stories about one of the most talented families in wrestling. My Grandma once said that they were &quot;Simply the FINEST men she had ever laid eyes on&quot;."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-29,"I do not care one bit about watching sports or learning about sports history, AND YET I adored this movie. Excellent writing, directing, cinematography, and acting across the board. Good filmmaking can any subject matter engaging and entertaining- this is proof positive. A worse team behind this film would have made me feel alienated and bored for not already being knowledgeable of or interested in wrestling, but this was a beautifully heartbreaking film."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-22,As much as it breaks my heart watching this trailer it makes me happy to know that the legacy of the Von Erich‚Äôs live on. To me the greatest family in the history of professional wrestling.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2025-04-05,I came of age watching the Von Erichs wrestle on TV. Which means hearing that tragedy had struck their family yet again was a part of growing up for all wrestling fans of that time. Thank God we still have Kevin amd even more so that he was able to move beyond the pain.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-15,A24 is rising the ranks of hollywood with really good quality movies while also letting creators do their things and paying everyone equally for the work they did.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"i cannot express how much this movie means to me,i grew up watching these brothers mourned the yellow rose of texas,cheered kerrys championship win over the nature boy,watched every match they had with the freebirds,wccw was our religion, i cannot wait,but as excited as i am,i know its going to be ruff to relive it,the good and the bad,we were young happy care free,and their love for each other made me and my bros bond stronger,thank u and god bless the von erichs"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,I&#39;m so proud of Zac. He&#39;s really come a long way since his Disney days. I hope he&#39;s still acting when he&#39;s 70. I see a few Oscars under his belt before he retires.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2025-04-15,"The scene where Kevin is crying for his brothers, while watching his kids play football really got me. I got a lump in my throat when his boys told his dad it&#39;s ok to cry."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,"Seeing Kerry on a motorcycle, knowing what happened, gave me chills."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-13,Haven&#39;t stepped into a movie theater in YEARS and you better believe I&#39;m bringing my son to this opening day. Looks incredible and got goosebumps from the trailer already ! Love Zach and my boy Lip! Underrated actors and the best production. THIS has been needed
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,Zac has really nailed down the voice and mannerisms of Kevin from what I&#39;ve seen so far. This is going to be one hell of a devastating film.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-08-25,"I lost my brother in 2020 and after watching this I felt the trauma of the grief of losing someone from suicide come back. Everything played back in my mind, from how he acted before that day, to that exact time we found him. I still miss him everyday but what happened.. happened. Man, this film is so f*cking good not because of how it can relate to my personal experience but because of how realistic they conveyed the struggle of grief and how to handle your emotions as a man in this kind of society we live in."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,So happy for Zac. Such a great string of dramatic and comedic work.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,"Im so glad they chose their story for this.  I grew up going to their matches live, they were amazing and always sweet to their fans.  Everytime tragedy struck their family it hit hard, so i hope they do their story justice."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,A24 making movies the people want to see!
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-06-07,"It‚Äôs so cool seeing the people I grew up with in my youth who were child/teen actors coming into their own as A list movie stars and musicians. Zac Efron, Kristen Stewert, Robert Pattinson, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Ariana Grande (not even a fan but she‚Äôs still unbelievably talented and you can‚Äôt deny that) and there‚Äôs a few others who deserve the credit ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.They‚Äôre the new generation at being the best at their craft and actually having true passion and talent for it."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-24,"For me personally, best movie I‚Äôve seen this year. Everyone in the theater was crying."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-26,saw this today. i wasn&#39;t alive in the 80s but my gen x parents love showing me their matches on youtube whenever we drink in the living room. the way my parents could go on for hours about how iconic they were. i just saw this movie today and my goodness the ending made me cry.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-11-27,That &quot;I told you to look out for him&quot; had to be fritz yelling at Kevin over one of the other brothers death. The emotion and anger in that one line is fantastic. Im prepared to cry that night
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-07,Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White deserved Oscar Nominations for this.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-14,Zac continues to make incredible choices for roles. He has become a generational talent.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,"I&#39;m not huge on wrestling, but I have good friends that love it. You don&#39;t need to love wrestling to appreciate this story, and based on the trailer, the execution of bringing it to life will make it that much better. I can&#39;t wait for this film."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-06-30,"I‚Äôm not a wrestling fan (at all), but I am a fan of Zac Efron and A24. I just recently watched this movie not knowing what to expect. It took me days to fully process this movie and to shake its emotional heaviness. It is such a shame it wasn‚Äôt nominated for an Oscar. This is an excellent movie that hits hard."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,Damn Zac Efron is a beast. Im excited for his acting
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,"Zac is an amazing actor. Not all actors can go extreme just for their roles. First Baywatch, now this."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2025-04-15,"I grew up in the 80&#39;s watching WCCW and the Von Erichs were huge stars. For those who didn&#39;t grew up on wrestling, this movie should have shown more in detail exactly how all of the Von Erichs brothers died, including the patriarch Fritz."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,What a nice wholesome looking Christmas movie
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-02-24,"The last 15 to 20 mins of this movie, just hit different.<br>Great Movie, even if you wasn&#39;t/aren&#39;t a  Wrestling fan, i would still recommend this.<br>‚úåÔ∏è"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-14,"Good movie, good scenes, good soundtrack, something to be excited about. Nothing crazy. Something real. Thank you"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-05-14,"Crazy, my dad was 1 of 6 brothers who grew up on a farm around that time. All his siblings are alive, including his two sisters. Really puts things in perspective how fortunate they are to still all have each other. Large families create A LOT of good fun times."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-13,Ive always dreamed of a movie like this.I am so glad the right company is behind it
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,"For anyone that knows their history, the moment in the trailer that guitar riff hit... I know you felt it."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,"Just watching the trailer alone is giving me goosebumps. As a huge wrestling fan, especially from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, this is definitely going to hit hard."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2025-01-13,The most powerful Zac Efron performance to date! I was crying at the end. Zac deserves an Oscar for this!
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-31,"I haven‚Äôt seen this film yet, but I already know it‚Äôs gonna be beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. The visuals, the accuracy that went into making the Sportatorium look as good as it does.. there was so much love and care that went into this film and it needed to be made. The Von Erich‚Äôs are a piece of wrestling history that doesn‚Äôt get enough credit. They not only made tag team wrestling what it is today, but without them, wrestling wouldn‚Äôt be where it‚Äôs at today. I wasn‚Äôt alive during their time, but my mother has told me countless stories about how big they were. I remember her telling me a story about how they came to town one summer and the excitement and talk of the town was so crazy that you would‚Äôve thought that the Beatles were coming."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-22,"This movie exceeded my expectations, every character moves you and you‚Äôll want to hold onto your siblings longer ‚ù§üíî‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πtakes you back to the emotional toughness most of us grew up with, bravo to the cast made this one tough girl cry üëè"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-11-09,This just brought tears to me eyes. My favorite wrestling family. Greatest Texans of all time. Can&#39;t wait to see this movie. I know I&#39;ll probably very the wholetime. Especially the funeral scene. We all mourn each one of them as if they were blood relatives. Best part of my childhood was watching them in the ring‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-07-17,"Once again, Zac Efron shows what a truly amazing actor he really is ! Yet, still to be armoured with attention? Why? Vastly underrated"
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-01-19,This film was phenomenal. A very tragic story of a man and the pain he feels losing his brothers one by one. I could feel that pain and it really broke my heart. 10/10
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-12,Seeing the Von Erich brothers in the ring fighting the Fabulous Freebirds hit me so hard &amp; completely took me back to my childhood.  Knowing that only two of the six people in that ring are still around is insane.  You could do a series on just World Class Championship Wrestling &amp; you will find too many tragic stories.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-14,Not gonna lie I teared up a bit when I saw the sportatorium went many times as a kid to watch the Von Erich‚Äôs battle against the freebirds. A lot of good memories.
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2024-04-22,"I watched this movie last night. Very sad and full of brother&#39;s love in this family. I watched All-Japan wrestling TV program in 80&#39;s. In the program I knew the tragedy 40 years ago.  In Japan this brothers or fabulous free birds were not so popular though, but I remember them.  Not exact happy ending though, his boys words and<br> New big family photo makes me feel very glad. from JapanüáØüáµüá∫üá∏<br>In 60&#39;s or early 70&#39;s Erich took his kid to the memorial hall in Hiroshima, he talked how terrible wars were to his kids.<br>from wiki<br>I hope their father was great one for kids."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-12-23,"Lot of emotion went through me. Big pro wrestling fan here, and this felt like a very fantastic movie going deeper inside the Von Erich curse. Kinda like a long episode of Dark Side of the Ring."
The Iron Claw,8KVsaoveTbw,2023-10-11,This looks incredible.  I literally got chills and my eyes started to water slightly just watching this trailer.  I never really knew too much about the Von Erich&#39;s growing up but I watched the Dark Side Of The Ring episode about their family and  it was brutal.  Zac Efron looks like a Von Erich and it is awesome to see him get a role like this and own it.  I am both excited and nervous to watch this film.

Jawan,MWOlnZSnXJo,2024-08-18,"Anirudh Ravichander‚Äôs music and background score significantly contributed to the success of ‚ÄúJawan.‚Äù His work added a layer of energy and emotion to the film that resonated with audiences, enhancing key scenes and elevating the overall cinematic experience. While ‚ÄúJawan‚Äù had a strong star cast, direction, and storyline, the music played a crucial role in creating memorable moments and amplifying the impact of the narrative.<br><br>Without Anirudh‚Äôs BGM and music, the film might not have had the same level of engagement or emotional connection with the audience, potentially affecting its overall success. However, the movie‚Äôs star power and direction would still have made it a significant release, though perhaps not to the same extent as with Anirudh‚Äôs contribution."

Jawan,MWOlnZSnXJo,2023-12-15,"I am Writing this in <br>December 15th 2023. <br>Jawan is one of my most favorite and most cool movies that I have seen. <br>Jawan earned over 1,150 Crores Worldwide thus entering the 1000 Crore Club Worldwide and over 644 crores net domestically in India thus creating and entering the 600 Crore Club in Bollywood/India. Jawan broke the historic records that Pathaan created and Jawan created new historic records. I am pretty sure that Dunki will break Jawan‚Äôs Historic Records as well and create new historic records as well. The Opening Day Collection for Jawan was 129.6 Crores Worldwide and over 75 Crores net domestically in India. If Dunki crosses 1000 Crores Plus <br>which it will, it will be a hatrick for Shahrukh Khan for delivering 3 Consecutive 1000 Crore Plus Mega Blockbusters which will be <br>Pathaan , Jawan, Dunki and many more to come in the future."

Nonetheless, the movie was great, and I consider it one of Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s best movies, aside from Raees and Zero and his movies before Raess.

Titanic25 Year Anniversary,I7c1etV7D7g,2023-01-15,"So many things came together to make this movie as memorable and iconic as it is. Sure, every few years, a studio or two throw a ton of money at a project to realize never-before-seen VFX and large set pieces, massive scenes with 100s or even 1000s of extras, and as much spectacle as money can buy. But ultimately Titanic worked so well, and it‚Äôs no small credit to how earnest Leo and Kate were with their performances, the many incredibly moving moments they share, and what an incredible score.<br>Nothing has ever come close."

Titanic25 Year Anniversary,I7c1etV7D7g,2024-10-11,Every year since 2012 been going to see titanic in theaters is basically like a tradition for me!! Nothing like it I seen this movie so many times but seeing it in theater is a different feeling!! What‚Äôs crazy is I was watching this while I had a bet in and it won (it was on hockey) too bad my eagles didn‚Äôt win the following day would‚Äôve been one of the greatest weekends I ever hadüò≠
Titanic25 Year Anniversary,I7c1etV7D7g,2023-01-11,"Simply the greatest masterpiece of all time, a grandiose film. Timeless romantic epic such as Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Doctor Zhivago and The Bridges of Madison County. One of the last super productions that linked gigantic scenarios with VFX, making you not know how to distinguish the real from the special effect. A set 10% smaller than the real ocean liner of 1912, which literally sank afterwards for the sinking scenes, a true absurdity even for current times. James Cameron gave his all to Titanic, and he was rewarded with this box office and pop culture phenomenon. This is cinema!<br><br>The sequence with the breaking of the glass dome of the Grand Staircase until the appearance of the ship&#39;s propellers, including the track A Building Panic, is one of the greatest in cinema. Every detail of the sets, figurines, makeup... Everything is unforgettable. The soundtrack composed by the late James Horner will echo for centuries, a real painting that gives the final touch to the work. Sissel&#39;s vocals in the opening and final scene of the film are impressive, a mix of emotions without using any words. A waltz that takes you to different places and memories of different times.<br><br>Film of my life, giving birth to my passion for cinema and the history of the RMS Titanic. No lie, watched about 500 times. Including a VHS broken from rewinding so much, the second part. Today there are editions on VHS, DVD and BD from other countries, as well as soundtrack CDs and games, including books, magazines, newspaper clippings, models and memorabilia in general. True fanaticism!<br><br>I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen in the 2012 3D re-release, now I can experience that unique feeling again. Screening in the cinema is completely different from everything else, do not miss such an opportunity. When I went to watch it in another city, I got a giant display. Brought inside the car, great adventure.<br><br>Even with strong and famous franchises of superheroes, science fiction and animations, Titanic continues as the third highest grossing in the history of cinema. Unbelievable, given what it grossed in its initial run in 1997. First film to break the billion mark, and the second to reach $ 2 billion. It should lose the position to Avatar: The Way of the Water, showing that James Cameron is James Cameron!<br>Theaters sold out for days, people watching on the steps of cinemas, C√©line Dion all day long on the radio, waiting lists to get the tapes rented at video stores, books and magazines in piles on newsstands, special programs on TV, explosive audience on HBO and NBC, 11 Academy Awards, several accolades...<br><br>Titanic isn&#39;t just an event, it&#39;s THE EVENT!"
Titanic25 Year Anniversary,I7c1etV7D7g,2023-02-15,"my parents had titanic on video tape and I had watched the film at possibly the age of 7/8? I remember putting the video tape into my small bedroom tv and the tape had to be rewinded to watch from the beginning with the fuzzy static being on the screen whilst it rewound.<br><br>i‚Äôve watched this movie throughout my life at all different ages.. from being a child, teenager, young adult, I am now in my late 20‚Äôs and I had just watched the movie in cinema for the first time, it was always on my bucket list to watch this movie in cinema as it deserves to be on the big screen.<br><br>it really did not disappoint.. as a child you are so fascinated by what is going on that you don‚Äôt take in parts that are soppy and a little emotional. when you grow older and realise how fast time is going.. the little scenes in this film from the band playing, to when the iceberg first hits, rose going down on the boat and then jumps off, everybody screaming and panicking, and of course the ending.. it shows that life is priceless. <br><br>everything about this movie is amazing.. the acting/actors, cinematography, dialogue, characters, soundtrack, the ending.. truly a classic."

Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FkLRUJj-o0&amp;t=166"">2:46</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FkLRUJj-o0&amp;t=170"">2:50</a> in the trailer is the most notable yet subtle element.<br>Bobby Deol expressing pain and vulnerability amid his face is all Gory goes on to show what a SUPERSTAR Hindi cinema has missed and the career that could have been"

Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-28,Ranvir and bobby killed it. Goosebumps üòÆüòÆ
Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-23,"Ranbir Kapoor has used his potential to an awesome extent, and it&#39;s clearly visible on the screen. The Rage. The Intensity. The BGM. This film seems like a total package, not only a full on masala entertainer but a true philosophical depth into the psyche of the character....Super hyped!"

Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-25,The trailer is nothing less than a masterpiece. The intro by Ranbir is fascinating and the craziness shown for parents reflects our love for them. Really looking forward to watching the movie.
Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2024-11-20,Animal trailer is far better than recent bollywood movies üòÇ‚ù§
Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-23,Can&#39;t agree more! Bobby steals every scene he&#39;s in ‚ù§
Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-23,"Ranbir Kapoor&#39;s powerhouse portrayal in the Animal trailer is nothing short of cinematic brilliance! His raw emotion and magnetic presence have left me in awe.

Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-24,What a acting Ranbir &amp; Boby Deol killing it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Animal,8FkLRUJj-o0,2023-11-23,Everyone was prepared for ranbir but bobby deol killed it in one scene
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,"The cast is soild and the movie looks great. But I think it&#39;s still too early to make a movie out of the Gamestop situation, because the actual story hasn&#39;t concluded yet."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-26,Happy that Paul Dano is the lead actor. Dude deserves it so much.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,This movie is just going to make me wish I 1.) bought GameStop stock and 2.) understood stock
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-27,This movie could actually be the catalyst for another surge in share price and I&#39;m ready for it.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-13,who is here after roaring kitty twetted again lmaooo
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Paul Dano is FANTASTIC in everything!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-16,"Having watched all of this unfold live, there has never been a movie I have been more hyped for."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-05,When the game is rigged ..... It still is rigged and this play is not over! <br><br>Power to the players!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-23,It puts a smile on my face that Keith Gill watched this same trailer in the same seat he livestream from on GameStop
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-13,"If you&#39;re coming back here for this, then you must know... we are SO back."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,"The true story of how I turned $300 into a truck and trailer to start a junk removal business. Thanks, WSB."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-24,"Paul Dano is seriously amazing, his range is unbelievable. This movie looks great it has a solid cast and an interesting story. I can‚Äôt wait"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,"I don&#39;t care If it does not reach a good critics level, this has to be a must watch, and including that cast, this projects to be awesome"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-03,I loved being a part/ still being a part of this. Went $1.3k to $58k in about 2 weeks and been option trading ever since. Still holding my shares cause why not.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-26,"this literally looks like The Big Short, Part 2, but with much lower stakes.... and I am HERE FOR IT!!!!!"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,"When I first learned about this, I was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs way too soon to be making a movie about the Gamestop reddit thing‚Äù but‚Ä¶ yeah, this looks like a blast. I love that it has the tounge in cheek style that The Big Short and I, Tonya had"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,I cant wait for the second movie
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Looks like this is gonna need a sequel.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-17,"For those of you that have any idea of the potential this will bring, just imagine all the people contemplating on going in after the movie&#39;s over. For those of you confused as to why I&#39;m talking about going into a movie after it&#39;s over, shut up,  enjoy the movie, and then buy like everybody else."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-26,"I‚Äôm loving the casting , Dano deserves a starring role,like this"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Sebastian as Vlad is wild casting; and it might just work!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Riddler is back!!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-11,"I noticed Shailene Woodley and America Ferrera right away. Also, Olivia Thrilby is in it as well. Those are my girls right there. But the person who is really going to make this movie great is Vincent D&#39;Onofrio. Who I think is the most underrated actor in history."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-10-12,"Didn‚Äôt expect to like this as much as I did! Lots of fun moments, not too preachy with the info - memes tastefully integrated and the story stays shockingly true to life, down to recreating sets, keith‚Äôs costumes, and Keith‚Äôs speech in detail. No brands or big names are hidden here - YouTube live and youtube studio are shown on screen as well as popular tik tok dance songs of the time, all building up a layered world of the film that makes it serve as kind of a time capsule for this mind boggling post pandemic story.  Lots of fun banter between characters you come to love (and hate) - a few of the film‚Äôs jokes might be lost for people who weren‚Äôt chronically online during that time, but I appreciate the little winks and nods (like Pete Davidson‚Äôs character having to explain to their mom ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a cat‚Äù). At a time when we were disconnected from each other, this event brought so many folks  together and showed the power of the people - Dumb Money is a well captured and relatable david and goliath story."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-29,The testament of real life story made into a film is whether it is already dated before it reaches the cinema. This story is as fresh and relevant as the time it originally came out. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Can‚Äôt wait for part 2!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-02-23,Just watched it. Great Movie and a great cast. As a trader myself this goes to show greed never wins in any situation regardless if you&#39;re a Big Guy or a Small Guy.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-20,Love how far Paul Dano has come! Dude is a legend!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-25,The story isnt finished yet üíéüôå<br>APES NEVER LEAVING
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-28,Ma boi Paul Dano leading a film full of movie stars.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,NOT LEAVING --- THE STORY IS NOT OVER.<br><br>DRS GME -  OWN YOUR ASSETS.<br><br>DIRECT REGISTER YOUR SHARES.<br><br>SHORTS NEVER CLOSED.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-29,"For those who want context, GameStop was seen as the next &quot;Blockbuster&quot;. It was an &quot;outdated&quot; and &quot;rundown&quot; business that was doomed to soon be bankrupt; especially in the wake of COVID-19 and digital game sales. However, researchers like Roaring Kitty (the protagonist of this movie) and Michael Burry (the guy who predicted the 2008 Market Crash and was the first to short the housing market) figured out that GameStop had a lot more going for it fundamentally, and that it was being way over-shorted. So, when they went in and showed others why, eventually enough people got in and the rest is history."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-14,This aged like fine wine. I forgot about forgetting about GameStop.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-26,"The story simply isn‚Äôt over. This movie will be a piece of the story. Crazy to see an entire production film created to discredit, distract and hide what is still going on. Illegal naked shorting that was banned in 08 is still happening day after day on GameStop and shorts have never covered. It‚Äôs Bernie Madoff x10, In broad daylight."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-29,All 823 dislikes are from Wall Street lol
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-12-07,Just finished watching it. It is well worth the watch for anyone who has not seen it.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-08-05,I like the stock
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-03-09,OK so I‚Äôm not a big Seth Rogen fan but I still watched the movie. Absolutely loved it. Enjoyed all the characters and seeing regular people winning.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-04-26,The trailer doesn&#39;t show the reality of how great this movie actually is.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,To the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-25,"Absolutely loved this movie. And I almost understood what they were talking about. üòÇ The acting is superb and the script is brilliant. I think I‚Äôll go see it again. Power to the people, people."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,This looks good can‚Äôt wait to watch!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-13,Watching this for training.. we running again

Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-14,Im planning on being in the sequel
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-08-23,Obviously this needs to be a 2 part series. ‚ÄúDumb Money 2: Teddy‚Äù
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-28,"Ayyy this cast is MAD STACKED! Paul Dano is extremely underrated and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs gaining more recognition. Dude Is going down as a legend for sure. Pete Davidson, Seth Rogen, Sharleen Woodley!! And anybody remember Olivia Thirlby?! Haven‚Äôt seen her in a cool minute!! She was awesome in The Wackness."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,"Anthony Ramos hasn&#39;t been throwin away his shot lately, dude is killing it!"
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-24,Fun Fact:  Michael Jordan lost around $1billion dollars because his money was in a hedge fund run by Gabe Plotkin used to short GameStop.  The same Gabe Plotkin who&#39;s now buying a chunk of MJ&#39;s majority stake in the Hornets.
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-16,TAKE NOTES A SEQUEL IS UNFOLDING
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-14,Great movie! Will watch again. Extremely nostalgic if you came in 2020-2021
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-23,We need to make this the #1 movie everywhere!!! It‚Äôs not over yet!!

Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-12-26,"It was a very engaging movie. Sad reality, that billionaires want people to stay where they are financially and will do anything to achieve that. No one gets charged and convicted. But it is still an inspiring movie."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-30,I&#39;m ridiculously excited for this movie
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-10,this looks so good! off to watch that clip of that old rich dude crying that the poors can‚Äôt do this. it gives me life. üòÇ

Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-10-08,"Paul Dano makes this film a must watch, I got out of my way for his projects."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2024-05-22,The irony of this becoming a movie and AMC potentially making money off it. üòÇ
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-22,Paul Dano never misses!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-07-07,"They make movies about about the little man losing to Wall Street unfairly, and it‚Äôs seen as a entertainment movie now. And yet there is still nothing done about it. We must really be in a satire world."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-22,"GameStop is still massively short to the tune of 53million shares , short sellers have lost over 300 million this year , the story is not over....now a movie is coming out....."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-28,Anyone else think this film should have just been called &#39;Stonks&#39; on account of that meme representing that entire movement of spontaneous trading?
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-10-28,I&#39;m jist so happy to see Paul Dano on the screen again
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-10-10,Seen it 3 times. Love it
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-23,This looks phenomenal!!<br>Btw probably a good time to invest a little in GameStop stock (GME)
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-03,"Only half the story, party only getting started‚Ä¶we know the truth! Can‚Äôt wait for the sequel üòÅ"

Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-10-03,I am always mad that there a so few good movies about stocks and finance in general. <br>-The big short <br>-Wolf of Wall Street (which is more about degeneracy)<br>-Margin Call<br>Finally some new movies to add to the list!
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-12-02,Saw the film today. Its good
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-09-19,"Just got back from seeing this, my theater had a mystery movie tonight and this ended up being the movie. At first I didn&#39;t think I would like it, because I&#39;ve never seen the trailer or heard anything about it. DEFINITELY go see it, it was really good and entertaining."
Dumb Money,bmr8YmwnZ3w,2023-06-23,Amazing cast ü§©üëè
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,I feel spoiled getting two Dracula movies this year from Universal.  But I wish that Dracula Untold would get a sequel.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-16,"I believe I read somewhere that dracula is among the most depicted characters from literature. From film and television, to video games and comic books. He is, quite literally, immortal."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-22,"I read &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker for fun one summer while attending college and to this day, will argue it is the BEST horror story ever written. From the creative method that the story is told (through journal entries, logs, newspaper articles, documents) telling a chronological story through different viewpoints of characters, to the fact that the titular antagonist of the story is unapologetically evil, immortal and capable of taking many forms, to the various subtle yet deeper themes of the story.<br><br>All I will say is, I don&#39;t know who it was in Hollywood that actually read the original novel in full and finally managed to get this section of the story onto the big screen, but thank you! Looking forward to watching this in theaters."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,"I&#39;ve been expecting this movie to exist since the first time I&#39;ve read the book, more than 25 years ago. Finally!"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-15,The Log of the Demeter is my favourite part of the novel. So looking forward to this
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,"This is a genius idea to do a film about the doomed voyage of the Demeter, and it looks like they did a great job. Some awesome imagery and vibes here. Can&#39;t wait."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-26,"Dracula has a tough fight in his hands, it won&#39;t be easy to takeover the ship captained by Ser Davos."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-08,"I&#39;m excited about this chapter of the Dracula tale finally being realized! It&#39;s one of those tellings that&#39;s so interesting and suspenseful, that knowing how it&#39;s going to end doesn&#39;t ruin it!"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-13,Just got out of theater and the movie is SPECTACULAR! a different view of Dracula‚Ä¶..Perfect Cast!
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-16,Finally we need more vampire movies and without love story‚Äôs in them
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,Dracula is having a comeback this month! üî•
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,"The best episode of BBC&#39;s Dracula in 2020, wss about this voyage.<br> Been looking forward to this film since it was announced."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-05-12,This makes me wish that there were more stories about werewolves being told.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-10,"The fact that this got an R rating, has me highly optimistic."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,"I watched this going, &quot;Oh, so it&#39;s kinda like that time they shipped Dracula to England and everything went crazy,&quot; and then realized, yes, it&#39;s exactly that XD<br>Didn&#39;t see the description!"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-05,"I love how there&#39;s only one trailer, yet everyone is nuts for this movie and can&#39;t wait to see it."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-22,"This is, quite literally, one of the best ways to expand on the original Dracula. Because we know what happens. We know they don‚Äôt survive. We know the ship will appear in London harbor a ghost ship, devoid of even a single sign of life. It‚Äôs just a matter of filling in the HOW of it."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2025-01-16,"I just watched this and having never heard of Corey Hawkins, I just assumed he was a Brit.<br>You can imagine my surprise when I just discovered he is born and bred American!<br>Normally we Yanks sound like idiots when we attempt a British accent, but Corey pulled it off flawlessly!<br>Well done, sir!!!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,TWO movies about Dracula in one year? We are blessed by our unliving lord.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-18,Ships are perfect locked room stories and this is so atmospheric and I&#39;m hyped- and then Bullet With Butterfly Wings plays and I started cracking up in the theater because of the meme &quot;despite all my rage I am still just Nicolas Cage&quot; and it&#39;s playing right before Renfield
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-29,"Really good movie. Saw it the other night with my S/O and enjoyed it. It strayed from the book somewhat, but it didn&#39;t bother me at all. Since Twilight, vampires have had a bad rap. Time to make vampires scary again! And this movie does a great job accomplishing that. Felt like a good ol&#39;fashioned classic horror flick."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-04,"would love to see more dracula oneshots come out of this. like, there&#39;s a fair few threads you could follow without bringing in/even naming the main players, right? the zookeeper and his poor escaped wolf; the well-meaning residents of whitby and the mysterious dog. the men who are contracted to move/harbour dracula&#39;s grave soil once it gets to england? the emergency crew he hires to rush him back to transylvania? that last one has potential as a sequel to this, for sure"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,"I honestly never understood how Dracula wasn‚Äôt forced to slaughter the whole crew almost immediately.  Assuming sunlight actually kept him locked in the crates/coffins, why didn‚Äôt the crew find him within a week tops?  The best answer I have is that sunlight <b>didn‚Äôt</b> cage him in the crates and he was possibly posing as a member of the crew."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-08,Love they did a movie entirely to what I consider the absolute creepiest part of the story
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-09-09,Just watched this movie. Fantastic performance by Liam Cunningham! In fact good performances all round. Great casting and great actor performances. I&#39;m genuinely surprised by this movie.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,"TWO Dracula (üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) movies this year! One comedic, <b>this</b> one serious (which I approve)! The <i>Count‚Äôs</i> having a good year thus far (üòä)."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,I&#39;ve been waiting 5 friggin years for more information about this movie
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-18,"Finally, a movie about the Demeter when Dracula was on board killing the crew. I always thought that one small part of the Dracula novel was worth expanding.<br><br>Edit<br><br>For example, this short story and prequel to Dracula by Bram Stoker, was originally supposed to be a part of the novel. But Stoker cut it out for some reason. It&#39;s about when Harker first arrives in Transylvania during Walpurgisnacht and all the weird and creepy things he sees. And ironically, Dracula had to save him by paying off a group of soldiers. Because he knew that Harker would be stupid enough to not believe in the legends or stories. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6UbOlAJCEg"">https://youtu.be/V6UbOlAJCEg</a><br><br>Enjoy, for me this is the best rendition of Dracula&#39;s Guest there is on YouTube. The narration is superb. As is the sound effects. I listen to it every May Day of every year."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,YES! I am so excited for this film you have no clue. I hope it does well
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-30,"When I read Dracula I can‚Äôt believe how scary it was, it haunts my dreams every night. It feels like he lurks in the shadow around my room whenever I‚Äôm reading it. It worsens my anxiety at that time. I‚Äôm never going to pick up that book again If I am told to read it."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-20,Love vampire movies! Dracula&#39;s design looks inspired. Interested to see how this turns out.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-10,"I think it would&#39;ve been way more effective if they didn&#39;t reveal Dracula&#39;s design until it was actually released in theaters. Can you imagine everyone&#39;s reactions to see a giant winged beast swooping out of the shadows, and the first time they see it is in a darkened theater?"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,Most anticipated movie of this year!!
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2024-02-04,"My favorite part of this trailer was when Dracula appeared and said, &quot;It&#39;s Draccin time.&quot;"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-21,"This Dracula vs the Wolfman from 2010 would be an interesting rematch for the century if this movie gets expanded upon for a franchise, I love the creature design for Dracula"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-09-06,the captain&#39;s log was the darkest and scariest part of the novel for me. you can feel the nightmarish experience of the people aboard. I thought id nver see it on screen.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-16,I love the vibes and tone of this film. Its giving me chills and shiversssssss!!!
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-04,"Every few years, I come across a movie that i honestly feel was made specifically for me! Amd this is one of them... Cannot wait."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-05-18,Someone in Hollywood finally read the damn book and took something new from it üëè üëè
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-10,BRAM STOKER&#39;S DRACULA!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!<br><br>LET&#39;S GO! THE OG IS HERE!
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-15,"At sea, no help for leagues. And the devil has come a calling. <br>Such a great idea to make the voyage of the Demeter into its own ghost story."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-10-15,"Short though it is, it is actually my favorite part of the original Universal Dracula, where he looks out of the door of the hold at all the sailors wrestling with the ship against a tempest."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-16,"Saw Renfield last night and it was funny seeing another trailer for another Dracula movie,although it does look like it could be a good movie,definitely not gonna be a comedy like Renfield üòÇ"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-22,"This is a fantastic idea, Dracula&#39; s journey to England.  Finally get to see what happened in full detail on that journey. This looks sick!!!üíØ and im here for it."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-20,"This looks a hell of a lot better than Renfield, plus it&#39;s actually somewhat sticking to the source material.<br><br>The one gripe I have is that this version of Dracula is that he turned into a  giant bat like he was in the Gary oldman film, instead of just an old man going around killing people. BUT, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll still enjoy the movie regardless. <br><br>To be fair, there was the hint that he could take on other shapes, at least in the book (or maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t remember, it&#39;s been a while since I read the book, I&#39;ll have to re read it again)"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-27,"If you&#39;re familiar with Dracula&#39;s story, you know everyone&#39;s toast."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-18,Yes! We need more original stories and less remakes from Hollywood. Let the creativity flow!
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-26,Now this is an interesting premise to use. How can you escape a predator on your own ship out in the sea with no one else to help you. I am definitely watching this one.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-09-21,Very much enjoyed my viewing and will absolutely purchase on bluray. üëç
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-11,"We just seen the movie and in a word, awesome! The vampire is one of the scariest on film and I‚Äôve seen hundreds of horror movies. And the premise of being at sea with nowhere to go is just as frightening. I interpreted the ending to be a set up for a sequel. I‚Äôll be getting the Blue Ray as soon as it comes out."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-10-11,Excellent movie. One of the best this year in the horror genre. Beats the NUN 2 by far. Excellent take on dracula as the fierce creature he truly is. Highly recommend. Suggest watch on a large screen with surround sound.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-13,"Frankenstein next, please!"

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-03,Ovredal is one of best horror director&#39;s we&#39;ve seen in a long time. This looks great.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-11,I was listening to this part of the book via audiobook whilst stacking shelves in a super market... I remember the hairs on my neck standing up in certain parts...
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-04,The craziest part is by the book. These aren&#39;t people he chose to torment. To him the crew is just a bunch of living snacks until he reaches London. And I think that makes this situation even scarier.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-06-18,I saw this last night when I saw the Boogyman. I was blown away by this trailer! üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíØ

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-31,This is so good<br>The timeline from Bram Stokers Dracula<br>When he got shipped from his castle to London
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-14,"im so curious how this is going to go, because they&#39;ve introduced more of a main character than the Captain was in the book, as well as a child, and a plan to kill Dracula. but of course in the book, nobody makes it off the ship alive."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-06-24,I am all for this. Multiple movies like LotR. Same cast and director. Take my money. I&#39;m a fan of the director&#39;s previous work.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-11-05,Watching this movie feels like the woman and the black dude are enemies more with the white male crew than with the vampire...
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-24,"Just great. Dracula is shown countless times in the trailer, now there‚Äôs no real surprise. Blew it."

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-04,Finally!!!! This is the horror tone of the book! Not that romance that was made with Winona Ryder! <br><br><br>Been waiting for someone to bring ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù back to horror roots. He never wanted to date you! He wants to eat you! Literally! üòÇüëèüèª
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-09-06,"Blimey! The film is brilliant, so I was truly lucky: had I watched this bloody trailer, I would probably skip the film."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-19,Most anticipated movie of this year!! Awesome trailer!! üî•üî•
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-15,"They were on the ship with Dracula for like a week in the water. If they could of located the issue as dracula, they simply could of dumped the casket overboard. Problem solved"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-09-03,bro i need this movie as an Dracula fan I just love the cinematography and everything about it
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-06-01,"This is my favourite section of the novel and many tellings of dracula kind of skip it. I think the Coppola version shows it like a classic &quot;boat moving on the map&quot; transition. I don&#39;t know if its enough to make a full lenght movie out of it, but reading Stoker&#39;s novel i thought that the perfect Dracula movie should feature this as a 10-15 minutes contained chapter, like a short movie inside the movie. That&#39;s how it feels when reading the novel."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-26,"I LOVE DRACULA STORIES. BUT RARE TO FIND A GREAT ONE, THE PAST DRACULA THE UNTOLD STORY WAS AWESOME HOPE TO HAVE SEQUEL ON THAT ONE. I SAW THIS TODAY AND IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE. HOPE THEY MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS.."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-15,This looks really good and I&#39;m excited to watch it but I did laugh out loud at the Smashing Pumpkins needledrop. Hope that&#39;s just a promo thing and not in the actual movie (love the song but that was a weird tonal shift)
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-12,&quot;You dress like a learned man&quot;<br>Classic Davos üòÇ

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-20,"If Huckleberry gets it, we riot."
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2025-02-24,"This is my favorite type of horror movie, in the league with Alien and the Shinning, where the characters can&#39;t escape the situation, its also the only reason they are alive"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-21,Man reminds me of 30 days of night. I really like the take on a feral primal vampire more wolf like pack mentality . Haven&#39;t read the comics but I hope there&#39;s  a more theatrical way they can adapt more of these type of vampires . I know there&#39;s a direct to home sequels and it&#39;s bad .
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-05-20,It would be a hell of a surprise if Luke Evans comes out at the end as Dracula. One could dream but I sure hope to hell it happens.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-10-30,Wonder why they didn‚Äôt sink the ship in the daytime and take lifeboat to shore.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-04,"Cool idea, superb soundtrack (the Nosferatu of rock music) - hope the movie delivers"
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-07,"I knew exactly what this was based on as soon as i saw the trailer. I am so excited for this movie, dracula has always held a special place in my heart"

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-18,"As someone whose favorite book is Dracula, this movie is going to be my Joker"

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-10-22,All they need to do is to dump the box into the sea during day light
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-12-20,This movie is more scary than the 1992 version of Dracula. If I say this is the most scariest version of Dracula that would not be exaggerating .
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-06-23,Isn&#39;t Dracula reliant on the crew to safely transport him to England?<br><br>Or is Dracula a sailor?
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-07-09,This is the second time Corey Hawkins has played a doctor
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-04-14,This is looks soooo good.<br>I miss good cinema.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,eQUBghzpgzA,2023-08-12,"I just saw the movie. For someone who reads the book 3 times and loves the  1992 version, I can say that the movie was just ok and nothing special. It‚Äôs worth too kill 2 hours of your time. I just don‚Äôt understand what a black jobless guy doing in the port of Varna Bulgaria in 1897?"
Joy Ride,jyI-AM5VXDo,2023-03-17,Asian actors are really getting their moment these days. Well deserved.

Wish to see many more from the writers and directors!"
Joy Ride,jyI-AM5VXDo,2023-07-06,Just finished watching it. It&#39;s legitimately a great time. They left the best parts out of the trailer. Highly recommend it!
Joy Ride,jyI-AM5VXDo,2023-03-17,I see more American films with an Asian cast coming out in these recent years than all my years of living. This new rise of Asian representation just makes my heart so happy üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I grew up on Chinese wuxia films so to see wuxia taking a comedic spin in an Asian American film is everything.

Joy Ride,jyI-AM5VXDo,2023-07-10,"Saw it &amp; loved it!  Well-written, hilarious, touching, surprising... Gets all the Asian American and cross-cultural references down so well.

Joy Ride,jyI-AM5VXDo,2024-05-10,"I just watched this movie. The comedy was somewhat shocking but HILARIOUS! Deadeye (Sabrina Wu) is my favorite character. So funny! I love all these actresses, but honestly the studio would have made a huge mistake not casting Wu. Anyone (no offense) could have done the other 3 roles, but Deadeye was the icing on the cake. Her role really made this movie the success that it was in my opinion. No, Wu did not write this post. lol. üòÇ And I also loved the way all the people in this movie meshed well together. Good casting!!!"

His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-08-23,"For those saying it&#39;s supposed to be Ishmael, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s Isaac, the promised seed born through God&#39;s promise by a barren woman.<br>Eventually that promise of the promised Seed came to be fully realized through Yeshua."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-07-09,Praise The LORD Forever Amen Hallelujah
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-10,"One thing is sure, God&#39;s word will stand while the skeptics fall to the side.      For those of you saying Ismael,    yeah,  keep on dreaming."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-03-13,"Hebrews‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠11‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠17‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠19‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨<br>‚ÄùIt was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham, who had received God‚Äôs promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, even though God had told him, ‚ÄúIsaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.‚Äù Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead.‚Äú<br>‚Ä≠‚Ä≠"
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-21,"After some reading, from what I understand Ishmael and his mother had already been sent away as Sarah had requested, therefore, leaving Isaac as the only son at that point in time."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2025-01-23,"His only son by Sarah, but definitely not his only son‚Ä¶ the Truth must be told. God hates a lie."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-21,"I wish, just once, that someone could come out with a biblical movie without ruining the story. This movie is no different. The biblical story is sufficient. Yep people feel they need to add Lib. Foolishness into it. It is no wonder that Christians have no good testimony today. Because they don‚Äôt believe the Bible is enough."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-02-22,I love immeasurably all Angel Studio releases.  I only would that the actor playing Isaac hadn&#39;t offered a vocal tenor immitating Ladka Gravas.
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2025-03-20,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-23,"Just a reminder that Angel studios is 100% mormon. And also, mormons aren&#39;t Christians."

His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2025-03-19,What to say i was actually exited to watch it but 5 minutes into it i saw 10 things that are not according to the Holy Scripture. I will better stick to reading it the truth is more exiting then this lies especially when its coming from God. My advice dont waste your time with this if you want to know the actual truth stick to reading the Words of God!
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-20,When Was Isaac &quot;the only son&quot;  Never.  Bible is confusing for sure
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-02-29,GAM sent me.<br>Religion is the greatest threat to humanity
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2023-11-13,"40 secs watching the trailer i suddenly realised that the foundation of the movie was wrong.Ismael is the sacrificial,the eldest one."
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-03-09,This is by far one of the worst productions of a bible story I‚Äôve seen. This is completely depressing.
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-02-29,He just don&#39;t have the look as the father of all nations
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-02-28,God is not good.
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2024-01-14,This movie is so incredible bad... skip.
His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2023-12-02,"This Is All False Story About Abraham&#39;S Family , Ismael Peace Be Upon Him Was The First Abraham&#39;s Child Not Isaac .. Ismael Was The Sacrifice.."

His Only Son,E-qP5puRv1Q,2023-12-03,"This is a pure twisted untrue story (movie) where Zionists are not telling you that Abraham (Ibrahim p.b.u.h) had TWO sons, Ismail and Isak. Where is Ismail p.b.u.h. in this movie as he was older then Isak and he is the one who was supposed to be sacrificed, NOT Isak. What happened to his wife Hajjer and his older son Ismail p.b.u.h when they were left in the desert alone to die? Isak was circumcised on the third day after birth and he couldn&#39;t be sacrificed due to this reason. So, Zionists are trying to change history, lying garbage."

The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,His last line in this trailer made me tear up! Never did a movie trailer manage to do  this. Incredible Brendan Fraser.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-18,"If Brendan Fraser wins an Oscar for this acting, I&#39;ll cry my heart out. He really made my childhood awesome."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"Last scene ‚ÄúI need to know if did one think right with my life‚Äù broke me. How Brendan deliver this line right in the heart. Just this 3 seconds I already crying bc this line and how this delivers feels something. Yes, Brendon you deserve everything in this world."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-23,"I just finished this movie and I cried so much after it was over. It takes you somewhere. It&#39;s bleak but not in a bad way, it&#39;s not commercial, it wouldn&#39;t be everyone&#39;s cups of tea but it&#39;s honest, raw and so damn deep!! I&#39;m so glad that Brandon frazier is back, he deserves the world!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,As many are saying... This is the first time I&#39;ve cried in a trailer too... It&#39;s great to see Brendan Fraser back... And this really looks like it&#39;s going to be his best performance ever
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I had an emotional breakdown 7 years ago. Hearing Brendan say &quot;I need to know I&#39;ve done one thing right in my life&quot; made me have memories pouring in of that time in my life. I felt very similar feelings, thinking I&#39;d done nothing, and will never do anything. This movie is going to be a rollercoaster that I hope I&#39;m ready to ride."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-16,Brendan Fraser was one of my favorite actors growing up and after seeing all he went through in his life it felt like watching your hero fall. That last line he delivered really got to me. I hope he gets so many good things coming his way.

The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-16,"&quot;I need to know I have done one thing right with my life.&quot; My God, the feels it gave me. Touched all the strings in my heart.

The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"&quot;I need to know I&#39;ve done one thing right in my life.&quot;<br><br>An emotion, I think everyone can relate to"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-17,I had the privilege of watching this film in a film festival and it was one of the best feelings in the world. I was crying from the beginning to the end and I had to remove my tshirt after the show because the neck part was literally soaking with tears. The way Brendan resonates with his character and ultimately the audience is just beautiful.<br>This is undoubtedly the best movie I&#39;ve watched in a while.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-13,Congrats on the Oscar Brendan!   You deserved everything you received!  Thank you for your performance.  You are loved
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"I can‚Äôt explain how happy I am for this man. He‚Äôs the only famous person I‚Äôd just hug and tell him he‚Äôs a great human being, and I don‚Äôt even personally know him. I am so, truly, fully happy for this man and I hope so much that he‚Äôs happy and in a great place mentally. He deserves the very best life has to offer."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I don&#39;t really cry for movies but Fraser just saying &quot;I Need to know I have done one thing right with my life&quot;, and the way he acted in just that brief scene had me in tears... I am not emotionally ready for this. Darren Aronofsky knows how to direct an Oscar Worthy performance"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-22,"I just saw this in the theater, legit everyone in the theater including myself was crying. The credits were rolling and we all were motionless in our seats and had tears running down our faces. Most powerful movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Best acting I&#39;ve ever seen. Welcome back Brendan."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-07,&quot;I need to know that I have done one thing right in my life&quot;. This scene and this line persuaded me to watch the movie and I was not let down.

The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-16,"Jesus, that last phrase and the way Brendan delivers it... So cutting and sincere, as if it&#39;s not just phenomenal acting but Brendan&#39;s genuine cry out. Simply amazing."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-21,Congrats Brendan for Oscar!
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-19,"I gotta admit something, I weigh 400 plus pounds and seeing this trailer makes me cry so damn hard. To feel all alone in a room surrounded by people who love you. The constant reassurance that youre doing something right! The need to make people happy above yourself are feelings that I know all to well. To anyone dealing with the feelings, I want you to know that youbare not alone. You may not know it but someone depends on you, that person...needs you in their life. YOU ARE IMPORTANT! YOU FUCKING MATTER!!! Dont let anyone ever tell you differently. I may not have achieved much in my life but if this message touches just a single soul and motivates that soul to chase their dreams....then I know Ive achieved my purpose. I love you all"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I‚Äôve been destroyed by great movies before, but this might be the first time a trailer tears me up from the inside out. All the best to Brendan Fraser, he deserves it and in his humility has put in the work to also earn it."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,I&#39;m glad Brendan is getting more attention for his roles. I love A24 films so I can&#39;t wait to get invested into this story.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-15,"That last line,when he was crying. Came from his heart. So damn proud of him..."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,That line ‚ÄúI need to know I did one right thing in my life‚Äù immediate tears. I know this movie is gonna be really good üíØ
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,Have never been so emotionally moved by a trailer. The final scene‚Ä¶. Tears. Goosebumps. Hair standing up. Never have been more happy and excited for someone to have a comeback than Brendan Fraser in this film. He deserves nothing but the best. Its going to be heartbreaking and I cannot wait. We love you Brendan
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,Brendan deserves every single bit of praise he gets for this performance. my family and i met him once at a store and he was so kind to all of us. it made our vacation to meet one of our favorite actors and he be just as nice as you could hope for. my sister and i will always be forever fans of Brendan.üíô
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-08,"dude i‚Äôve just finished watching this and i‚Äôve used like a whole roll of toilet paper cause i was sobbing so much. if any describe this film any other way than ‚Äúphenomenal‚Äù. it is so. i have no words. it has so many layers and it‚Äôs just so. the actors‚Äô performances are outstanding. this film deserves every single award. Brendan Fraser is just. wow. if you‚Äôre wondering whether or not to watch it, watch it. just make sure you‚Äôve got tissues, plenty of water and someone you feel comfortable crying around cause you‚Äôll be doing that A LOT."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"This is just a trailer, and I got really teary at the end of it. I&#39;m so, so, so incredibly happy that someone like Darrenofsky gave Fraser a shot to lead such an emotional project. And by what I&#39;m hearing, Fraser has delivered a performance for the ages. Well done, Brendan Fraser. Glad you&#39;re back in the spotlight."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,This looks really good and pretty heartbreaking. I can&#39;t wait to see Brendan give the performance of a lifetime.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,I love the meaningful roles Sadie has been auditioning for and challenging herself with. She&#39;s one of the most talented / Versatile young actresses in the industry and these roles have definitely taken her out of the shadow of her stranger things cast members. She&#39;s brilliant.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-13,So Happy for Brendan for winning The oscars. This should be a lesson to everyone who is thinking about giving up.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"We‚Äôve had ‚ÄòBrendan Fraser Week‚Äù, watching all the older films, leading up to seeing this. One of the most underrated actors of all time. So funny, so charismatic , so talented with his performances. I could go on. I am so excited to see one of my favorite actors of all time back giving us, the fans, what we‚Äôve missed for so long. Thank you for being you Brendan. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"Wow, the detail in the beginning where everybody&#39;s screen is on except for Charlie who&#39;s the instructor, is interesting. the way every single person feels so humane and relatable is great. I&#39;m also invested in knowing more about the relationship of charlie and his nurse. to be able to inject a bit of lightheartedness with a playful joke in between then deliver a gut wrenching line in the end, only Brendan Fraser could&#39;ve done so. He&#39;s just so perfect for the role. I can&#39;t wait for Dec 21 and bawl my eyes out"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-17,"So proud to see Sadie here. She is young and this is only the beginning for her. I&#39;m telling you, she will go far. AND THIS FILM BETTER BE NOMINATED FOR EVERY POSSIBLE CATEGORY OF THE OSCARS, BRENDAN MUST WIN ONE"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-09-26,"‚ÄúI need to know that I have done one thing right with my life‚Äù that was iconic. He nailed the entire role but that line, he acted that out phenomenally. I‚Äôm really glad he won an Oscar for this film. He honestly really deserved it."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,‚ÄúI NEED TO KNOW I DID ONE THING RIGHT IN MY LIFE!‚Ä¨‚Äù<br>That dialogue delivery. Give him an Oscar already. Good to see you again Brendan Fraser.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,Bro when he said ‚ÄòI need to know I did one thing right in my life‚Äô literal chills up my spine and teary eyed. I will always love Fraser just delivers lines so brilliantly and with so much emotion
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-17,A trailer has never made me cry before. Brendan deserves an Oscar just for these 2 minutes alone üëè
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-16,"I&#39;m crying just by looking at this trailer. Th emotions Brendan was able to show in just the few lines he spoke is absolutely amazing. Welcome back Brendan, the Oscar is in good hands."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,Even the trailers for this movie have me in tears. Brendan is incredible and I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s finally getting the recognition he so truly deserves.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-16,"It took only <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWiQodhMvz4&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> to have me in tears. I hope Brendan Fraser does win an Oscar for this film!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"The closing scene in this trailer is Oscar worthy. Made me cry instantly, couldn‚Äôt even catch myself. I‚Äôm so happy to see Brenden back and thriving ‚ô•Ô∏è"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-14,Never has a movie torn me up emotionally and made me cry the way this one did. Absolutely brilliant.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,I don&#39;t think Brendan was even acting when he said &quot;I need to know that I have done one thing right with my life.&quot; That came straight from the heart. Had me in tears man.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-01-08,"As the reviews are saying, this is the most convincing and real performance anyone in Hollywood has ever pulled off. The whole theater was bawling their eyes out when the movie ended. All the tears dropped were the proof of what makes us human beings. The ability to cry after watching a man like all of us, struggling with the cruel and full of adversities thing we call existence"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-26,People don‚Äôt understand how good of an actor you have to be to be able to cry on cue and pull your heart strings. Brenden Frazier is truly gifted.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-04-03,"I watched it and cried buckets, from beginning to end! I didn&#39;t think Brendan Fraser had it in him to play a dramatic role like this with such tenderness and respect but he blew me away.<br>The whole Cast is amazing and I am happy that Brendan received an Oscar for this masterpiece.A lifetime achievement as actor and human being."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"Never have I been this floored at a performance from a trailer where I‚Äôm brought to tears. This is the first trailer to do that, so Brendan Fraser is going to win the Oscar. He deserves it!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,That last line brought me to tears. The whole trailer shows his passion for his craft. I cannot wait to see this.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,I have never cried from a movie trailer until just now. It caught me off guard and seems so genuine.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-13,"So happy he won the Oscar especially after all that he&#39;s been through.<br>I, think we all want to know we&#39;ve done something right in our lives. Even if that one thing is very small. We all need that kind of connection."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-03,"Believe the hype. I‚Äôm an action and comedy guy. The wife asked me to watch it with her and I begrudgingly said yes, as I‚Äôam cheering for Brendan Fraser. This film and a number of performances within it, are outstanding. Completely exceeded my expectations and my wife‚Äôs. The Oscars are a joke, and regardless if this film doesn‚Äôt take home multiple awards, it is my new favourite film."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-01-18,"New dad here, with my own personal struggles, and I have to say this speech at the end of this trailer absolutely slays me. Literally ugly crying. My daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and these words hit so close to home. I needed this."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-09-08,"Brendan has always been a pleasure to watch on screen, for his good looks of course and because he&#39;s Canadian,  but also for the delight  of his smooth , intuitive acting.<br><br>I just finished watching The Whale and can&#39;t stop crying. The performances all round were top of the line. The whole movie is shot basically in one room with very few props. It rests entirely  on the riviting  portrayal of its central characters, and it succeeds in spades!<br>Definatel Oscar material and I&#39;m so happy for Brendan&#39;s win.<br>I only hope I can stop crying before the night is over."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"The last line by Brandan really put me in tears, god. Just for that scene he needs the Oscar"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"What a wonderful trailer! You can feel the emotional vibes to it. The part hit me when he said, &quot;I need to know that I have done one thing right with my life!&quot; I hope with all of our prayers that Brendan Fraser gets an Oscar. He deserves it!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-30,"Have already watched this movie twice and props to all the actors, Brendan especially. It definitely left an impact on me in trying to see the humanity in others and it had me in tears throughout. He deserves all the praise and awards for this amazing piece of work and I am here for the Brenaissance. Protect this gem of a man at all costs!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I remember when A24 was still an &quot;indie&quot; movie studio (not the book definition, but more of the adaptive terminology we created over the years to describe something that isn&#39;t main stream). I&#39;m so glad they still give these artists the freedom they want to make these unique art pieces, despite their rise in popularity. Some hit, some miss. I&#39;m just glad, amongst other indie film makers, that these unique stories are able to manifest and exist."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"That last line hits hard! Fraser deserves all the recognition he&#39;s getting. Not just because he&#39;s back in the spotlight... but because this, is a staggering performance."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-18,Just comes to show how much of a talent Brendan is. He has always been one of my favourite actors growing up.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-06,I am so happy to see Fraser has made a huge comeback and he is choosing to do projects that really matter.  We can all learn from his humility.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"Since I was 6 years old, Encino Man has been my all-time favorite movie. Brendan Fraser makes this movie. It is absolutely surreal to see him today, making his comeback. It‚Äôs also sad that he ever had to make a comeback. But stars will always find a way to shine. They couldn‚Äôt hold Brendan back. No one can. I just want to give this man a hug and a handshake and let him know that he‚Äôs an amazing man and he deserves everything positive coming his way. This is the Hollywood story we all need."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"‚ÄúI need to know I did One Thing Right With My Life!‚Äù <br><br>That line hit me hard, as i can currently relate to it since my whole life to this day, feels just similar and I‚Äôm already in tears.<br><br>The way he delivered it spoke to the very soul."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-01-01,The best acting I have ever seen in my entire life. The performance was so moving that the audience literally sat in their seats in awe of what they just experienced when the credits rolled. It is such an incredible shame that the film is not being shown widespread. I live near Chicago and had to drive 40 minutes to get to a theatre showing it. It was well worth it.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2025-03-21,Just finished watching it on prime. What a movie. What a performance. I cried my eyes out towards the end.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,I literally cried just from the trailer alone. My boy brandon... how can you not love him.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"I&#39;m really interested in this one. For someone who grew up seeing Brendan in fast paced action films, it&#39;s good to see him succeed in more dramatic territory. He deserves it."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"Amazing how a predominantly comedic actor like Fraser is so good in being so amazingly dramatic, yet in a genuinely human way.<br>Also, it is surprising to see Darren Aronofsky filming a drama movie, but you can still see his focus on human existentialism, although this time there is less dread in it (Requiem to a dream, black swan, mother) and more hope (like the fountain)"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-13,"I was thinking and talking about Brendan&#39;s talent and potential for more than 10 years, couldn&#39;t be more happy for him. He finally gets what he&#39;s always deserved."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,I&#39;m really interested in this one.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"God this got me so emotional. The character Brendan Frasier is playing is basically my father. He is also a very big guy but has just as big a heart. Watching this trailer, it reminded me of him and how his connection with me and other people has led him to keep going. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna be ready for this movie"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"Like everyone already said, that closing scene is soul crushing. Brendan&#39;s performance is gonna be incredible, i can feel it."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-27,"Haven&#39;t seen the film yet, but Brendan was a pivotal part of a lot of people&#39;s childhoods. From starring in classic films like George of the Jungle and the Mummy franchise. Truly grateful to see him back on the big screen again. A true legend of the film industry"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"I&#39;ve never had a movie TRAILER hit me this hard, the amount of emotion in a 2 minute clip is unreal."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,I&#39;m gonna have to wait for this to come out on Blu-ray. I don&#39;t know if I can handle the humiliation of ugly sobbing on a floor covered in popcorn and two year old sour patch kids.<br><br>But on a serious note I can already tell this movie is going to destroy me. But seeing Brendan Fraser acting again makes me so unbelievably happy. You can tell he is putting everything he has been through into this performance. So proud of him‚ù§Ô∏è
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,I was completely floored by Brendan Fraser&#39;s performance; it&#39;s certainly going to be his magnum opus. I bawled (along with the entire theater) in the last few minutes of the film. Unforgettable movie.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-07-26,I cried the whole movie. This was just one of the most incredible things i&#39;ve ever seen.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-01-02,&quot;Who would want me to be a part of their Life?&quot; <br>That line Broke my heart. He made me Cry. I am a man who never cries. Give him the Oscar!
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,How does a trailer make you literally well up with tears? Brendan Fraser just killed me with that delivery !
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-18,"So happy to see Brendan back.  I grew up with him as the lead actor in almost all of my favorite movies, and seeing his return made me realise how much I missed him despite having never met him.  Truly a wonderful man."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2025-04-17,The ending is what really got to me. The music and when his feet lift off the floor and he looks upward and sighs really loud and then the screen turns white. So moving and very sad. But it&#39;s also happy in a way because he has let go of life and his worn out body and is at peace finally. Such great acting and I&#39;m glad Brendan is back!
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"Brendan Fraser, you are a gift to all mankind. We don‚Äôt deserve you but we‚Äôre grateful you‚Äôre here. I cannot even begin to explain how much you were a huge part of my childhood. Rick O‚ÄôConnell was easily one of the coolest film characters in the action/adventure genre and there is not one actor that could‚Äôve played him as awesome as you did. I‚Äôve seen all the curveballs life had thrown your way and undeservedly so. It saddens me to see the way Hollywood treated you but words cannot express the joy I feel in seeing you make a comeback. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I love Brendan Fraser. If you love him too, please support the film and go see it! BRAVO A24! I can‚Äôt wait for the amazing physical media that will come out with this film!"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"God this gives me chills. Brendan&#39;s performance, along with Sadie&#39;s, it works so well. I cannot wait to see this"
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2024-09-19,"We just watched this movie a few days ago and I can hardly think of anything else. Poignant, harsh, beautiful and surprisingly inspiring. Thank you to the most amazing cast for being extraordinary storytellers."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,"I&#39;ve been a Brendan Fraser fan for 30 years. He&#39;s a remarkable actor. If he doesn&#39;t win an Oscar for this movie, I&#39;d be very surprised."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-19,"Oh my god, just having the video paused where he says that last line and scrolling back up to look at it sends me back into bawling my eyes out. This might be the best acting I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. This is the proof people need that you can do the finest and most influential work of your life... literally whenever you decide to do it. I want this to inspire that in everyone."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,"I started crying at the scene where Brendan Fraser&#39;s character is giving a motivational speech to young, good-looking people on screen with his camera off."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-13,Branden Fraser has won an Oscar people!! This is a day that will certainly go down in history. I fell in love with him in the mummy when I was a little kid and then he disappeared off the face of the earth. For him to win an Oscar for best actor for his comeback film is amazing to say the least.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,I‚Äôm going to cry my eyes out. The way I hear and watch him say ‚ÄúI need to know that I‚Äôve done one thing right in my life‚Äù puts a feeling in my heart that makes me relate to this in some way and makes me think of a lot of my family members. This is going to be a masterpiece.
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-15,That last line was SO hauntingly good.<br>I FELT how his character did.<br>I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS! <br>THIS MAN DESERVES EVERYTHING!!!!!
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-17,"Brandan Fraser has the kindest and warmest eyes, you just cant help but be drawn in by his performance and expressions. Every time I see him on screen I am moved."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-03-26,"I recently watch the film the whale tonight, I haven‚Äôt cried that much or related to movie that way for sometime.<br><br>I lost my father in a similar way. This pulled heart strings for me in a way that I couldn‚Äôt convey in words.<br><br>‚ÄúI need to know that I‚Äôve done one thing right in my life‚Äù<br><br>Brendan you did mate. You gave people and yourself of all hope. You deserved that oscar more then anyone for decades."
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2022-12-14,I was lucky enough to see it at a Filmfestival and it&#39;s one of the most emotional and best movies over the last few years<br>Brandon&#39;s performance is amazing and he proves with The Whale that he is one of the best actors of our generation
The Whale,nWiQodhMvz4,2023-01-08,"The aspect ratio of this movie really illustrated how confined Charlie is in his apartment and his body.  The way the actors delivered lines, you could feel the pain their words inflicted on the characters.  There is a lot of heart, pain, and suffering in this movie, but Brenden delivers a performance that reminded me one must have hope that somehow we need to try and correct mistakes and try to repair things.  This was a fantastic movie from the actors, the writers, the director, the directos of photography, lighting, sound engineers, and the set designers.  There was no BS in this movie."

About My Father,txLSE7tpgr0,2023-02-22,"I just love DeNiro, his roles always are great, funny, and has that vibe that I can&#39;t explain, the one that stuck with me from &quot;Meet The Fockers&quot;, that type of roles I enjoy where he is in. He&#39;s just great being serious in comedies, yet sometimes relaxed, and then sarcastic. But I really enjoy gangster type of movies with him in them, he&#39;s just perfect with the looks."

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-08-18,I am so happy for Angel studios to have reached this level of production! I remember back when all they had was a indie Christmas special and a couple of episodes of The Chosen season 1 and were depended on funds for each new episode =&#39;)<br>Sound of Freedom surely boosted their status and budget by 150% too
The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-07-29,"This looks dope. If this is the new independent wave of cinema outside of the Hollywood studio system, you have my attention."

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-08-08,This movie is NOT about &quot;reality shifting.&quot; This movie is NOT for you tiktok kids. Stop hating on the movie because it has &quot;Shift&quot; on the titleüôÑ

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-09-02,"This movie dates back to a short story written in 2006 and a short film based on that short story that was made in 2015. The script for the feature film, based on the short film, was written in 2018/2019. None of it was made with any awareness of the shifting community.<br><br>These comments are amazing."
The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-12-03,I‚Äôve never heard of the shifter community before‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure why they automatically think it‚Äôs about them other then the coincidence of the name. üòÖChances are the people writing the script haven‚Äôt heard of them either. What I do know is that this movie is supposed to be loosely based off the book of Job in the Bible with a Sci-fi twist.

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2024-10-17,Neal McDonough has been playing villains in secular movies for years and I&#39;m SO glad that he can do it in Christian films like this now!

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-07-15,You could have at least brought some actual shifters to help you write this movie. Anyways Alexa 4 life
The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-07-16,"Here is something wrong about this upcoming movie as a shifter.<br><br>1. You can&#39;t forced someone to shift because it doesn&#39;t work like that since it&#39;s somebody&#39;s choice to shift, not you forcing them to shift to a different reality. There&#39;s no way it can work like that.<br>2. Us shifters don&#39;t disappear when shifting to a different reality. Our physical body stays while we only move our consciousness in someone else&#39;s body in a different reality.<br>3. And no, there is no shifitng police. You can&#39;t get arrested for shifting because we are powerful enough to shift, even if we get caught for shifitng realities, it&#39;s not like the shifting police can stop us. We still have the power to shift. Also, the whole shifitng police thing is a whole inside joke in the shifting community.<br><br>Please, do some careful research on shifting because spreading misinformation is going to cause a huge messes in our community. Such as anti-shifters, demotivating shifters, hates, etc. Us shifters wouldn&#39;t want a movie that gave us bad representations about shifting. You could&#39;ve at least hire an experienced shifter to write for the movie, instead of grabbing pieces of misinformation on untrusted media. Thank you for taking your time on reading this."

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2024-02-09,Decided to read the comments on what seemed like a totally normal movie trailer... Discovered there is a seemingly large community of people who believe they are &quot;reality shifters&quot; that flock to the comments section of &quot;Shifting&quot; movies???? Why?

The Shift,Tl7rtMiOrvY,2023-08-02,"As a shifter, all these shifters are overreacting, it&#39;s a movie, yes all possibilities exist but when a movie doesn&#39;t line up with your view of shifting, despite that this movie is a real reality anyway, it&#39;s suddenly misinformation and targets shifters, heck you should be proud that there&#39;s even a movie being made about shifting anyway, i imagine new shifters will come from it and learn about it.<br><br>This is why i&#39;m not on shifttok anymore as despite believing in them, some shifters can&#39;t seem to understand infinite possibilities exist"

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-02-10,"I can attest to the fact that post death experiences are VERY REAL. My heart stopped for 5 mins,when i was 29..I was unconscious at the time. Yet i was able to recall slipping away/being dragged down into the hospital bed..Then a massive rush of lightness/i was above myself looking down watching myself/the doctors etc. It was an extremely peaceful feeling. Until my heart was restarted,and then i felt a huge rush and then heaviness upon being concious again. I was able to relay every action to my partner who was in the room. (Not typically allowed,but he was a nurse there that night!) The human body/soul is incredible. And i pay no attention to those who may dismiss my experience,as it was 100%real"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-03-09,"My experience was brief but I‚Äôll never forget it. I was taken to the light briefly, and I say taken, because there was someone with me but I wasn‚Äôt scared. Everything was bright and white. It was just long enough to feel the most peaceful feeling I‚Äôve ever felt in my life.. I can‚Äôt put it into words. While I didn‚Äôt see my family members like others, I know it was God who blessed me with a brief glimpse of heaven. I‚Äôm not scared to die. I know that the feeling I felt for the brief time is only the beginning of the eternal life, Jesus promised if we except him as our Lord and Savior."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-04-21,"When my Mom was on her last hours on this earth, my sister and I were sitting bedside with my Mom. I knew it wasn&#39;t long before she passed.

He came to take my Mom Homeüôèüôèüôèüôè I cried and said to my sister, Dad&#39;s here to get Momüò¢üò¢üò¢"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-05,"I&#39;ve read a couple of books on this phenomenon and I believe one of the people in this trailer wrote one of the books I read.  It was the lady, and if it is the person I think it is, she&#39;s a medical doctor and her kayake capsized, trapping her under the water where she died and experienced heaven.  The amazing thing about this and other NDAs that I;ve read about is that people who experience heaven in this way dont want to come back, they always want to stay.  And these are people with husbands/wives and children. Thats how incredible heaven is, in comparison this life and this world are nothing."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-11-09,"As an ER/ICU nurse, I&#39;ve listened to countless experiences!!!! I also overdosed myself, and I saw Jesus bringing me back to life because He needed me here on earth yet. I had a child die in my arms on Mother&#39;s Day, May 14th, 2000, and I felt the Spirit of The Lord Journey Matthew to Heaven. It was a painful, joyful, peaceful time of LOVE I could not express. Thank you Jesus üôåüôè‚úùÔ∏è"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-02-22,Everyone talking about &quot;home&quot; in the movie makes me start crying because I know I felt it too. It&#39;s as if my heart is overjoyed thinking about it. My nde was 3 yrs ago and it i didn&#39;t know it was so similar. I never heard anyone describe heaven as home or about the lights feeling like they were coming out of me and connecting to everything and everyone. I didn&#39;t understand what it meant to not depressed or anything and just very good.
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-09-06,I have had that experience twice in my life. That I was dead. The first time I was buried alive under a burning building . And the second time was after I was hit by a car while on a bicycle. And for me both experiences were absolutely wonderful. I did not want to come back . But God had other plans for me.

The nurses asked if we were ready. My aunt said yes that‚Äôs the granddaughter and I said ‚Äúmommy‚Äù and left the room crying and went across to the chapel that was right in front of her room that I didn‚Äôt realize it was a hospital chapel. When I hear screams and nurses yelling and I see them running around and Drs running in my grandmothers room.<br>She woke up!<br>She said couldn‚Äôt die in front of me!<br>She said she was floating over her body and saw family coming in and out visiting her and praying over her. She said two dead family members that came to meet with her. <br>After that I believe in after life, I believe so much. She said detail information especially said what one person wore during a prayer and that she didn‚Äôt like his shirt.  <br>She lived for two years after thatüôèüèΩ I got to spend two more years with her . And yeah, I told her that her daughter,  my aunt was trying to pull the plug on fast for the life insurance!"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-03-12,"When I was about 8 years old, I fell out of a pine tree while playing (manhunt) pretty much team hide and seek. I fell from the top of the tree hitting the ground hard. I had a brief moment floating up and I saw two of my friends walking towards where I had fallen. I woke up, gasping for air unable to breathe I used every ounce of strength to crawl to where there path was. I woke up again in the hospital and was told I was that I should have died. I am now 33 and will never forget that day."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-02-10,"I had one as a 5 year old. I was hit head on by a car while walking up our country road. I remember looking down while the doctors were cutting off my clothing, watching them work on me. I never told anyone until I was in my late 20s. It was so bizarre. I was brought back, and was then looking up at the doctor while on the table, yet I was apparently unconscious."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-29,"‚ÄúIf you talk about how you&#39;re going to die, or what&#39;s going to happen when you die, it frames how you&#39;re going to live. And what could be more impactful.‚Äù - Mary Curran Hackett. AFTER DEATH&#39;s stunning visuals and sound design/score become a portal for transcendence. Can&#39;t wait to experience this extremely powerful and thought-provoking visual storytelling immersion."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-02-09,"Wow wow wow! I didn‚Äôt think much of anything with this film. Just needed something to watch. As I was browsing movies I came across this film and so happy it caught my eyes. Grab your tissues bcz this film surely made me cry but it was all happy tears, Full of joy and just gratitude! I highly recommend this documentary to anyone with a curious mind of what it may be like after a NDE"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-08-11,"At two years old, my mom found me dead and stiff. She rushed me to a hospital where she argued bitterly with a doctor who swore I was dead. To demonstrate, he tried to pop my jaw open to prove it was shut, only for it to pop open as I gasped. He later made himself a cross, &quot;I have seen a miracle today!&quot;<br><br>I remember to this day, being escorted down a lane, my family on my left which numbered in the thousands upon thousands. I was wishing them farewell as it was my time to go. I don&#39;t remember what happened at the end, but the memory never faded. It was far too real."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-08-12,There was always life after death. Religions and Spiritualism on earth have been talking about since day one. Non believers are just harder to convince but the truth reveals itself in the end. Until then keep the faith. We&#39;re all going home one day!
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-11,I can at test to those who&#39;ve gone before come and meet you. As my father passed. He hugged the air. Mom said he&#39;s hugging all those who&#39;ve gone before. There is life after death.
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-03-03,"I am from Ethiopia, and I just saw this movie yesterday, i believe in everything they say about after death experience. Amazingly there is a Holly water place in the name of saint George, (in Ethiopia, around Gondor)and almost every person who went their and showered by this Holly water experience the exact same thing people even askes to see heaven or hell or different things and i have heard their wishes came true and they get cured from whatever problems they have. And from seeing their testimony even the visions and the images they expressed is similar with those people in this movie. Its just amazes me how God works in his misterious wey. This Hally place is called Bermel Giorgies."

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-19,"I have watched at least 3 of these NDE here on YouTube. I am so grateful that you included Howard Storms powerful story in your documentary! That man brought my Atheist son back to God and the Light! This looks so great. I just hope that it will come to television soon, because we are running out of time and as many people need to see this as possible! I am homebound most of the time, so I will wait as patiently as I can. (I am so excited to get to see Sound of Freedom...finally!‚ù§)"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-06,"This movie looks amazing! I read the book of Don Piper. I really hope that the movie makes it loving clear,that there is life after death for everyone. But that Jesus is the only way to get to Gods presence after death: heaven. I say this because Jesus came from heaven to die for our sins cause he really wants us to be with him in eternity. He loves us so much that he don&#39;t want to miss us and he really wants to save us from hell. His blood is to precious to deny this fact: The Lord Jesus Christ is the only way to the father, the only door to heaven."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2025-03-26,I FIND IT PERPLEXING THAT THESE EXPERIENCES HAPPEN TO EVERYONE ELSE EXCEPT ME

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-09,"I have read ton of books and doc series about this event and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie. The brain is amazing organ. We don&#39;t know all of how the brain works. I feel there is some kind of cosmic connection to all of it. If you believe in God or not. All the animals on this planet know there is innate power that drives all of them. We too are driven to what? We are born, we live and then we die. What do we leave behind? I feel if our lives have more powerful positive choices those choices all have a meaning to an end. What that is is still mystery that shouldn&#39;t be solved."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-18,Wish it released in all countries
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-17,Looks like a killer movie! I‚Äôm dead set on seeing it!
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-05-07,"Nothing at all like I experienced. <br><br>I had a choice to fear or to accept (?) <br>It was like I embraced and became All of what, who, how, and when I am. Joy<br>I was all things, at all times, and in all places. <br>Individually and as the all, simultaneously and sequentially. <br><br>It remains a source of internal peace for me to this day. <br>Words don&#39;t even reach insufficient levels to be true to that vision"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-08,"Yep, I keep trying to explain to atheists, Christians who only follow the Bible, and anyone that NDE&#39;s are real.  There&#39;s been 100&#39;s of millions of NDE&#39;s that have occurred to people over the last 2400 years.  One of the earliest of note is the &quot;Story of Er&quot; (Plato talked about this) about a soldier who died in battle and was laying on a funeral pyre for TEN DAYS.  His body didn&#39;t decompose like the other corpses did around him.  People witnessed this, then after 10 days, he sat up suddenly and walked away.  He spoke of his experience he witnessed and was sent back to talk about it.<br><br>Now that we have more and more ways to restart people&#39;s heart, and now that we&#39;re closer to the &quot;End Times&quot;, we&#39;re being allowed to hear of more and more of these experiences.<br><br>There&#39;s NDE&#39;s from blind people, blind their whole life, and they die for a moment on the operating table.  They come back and talk about what they look like, what the doctor looks like, all the nurses, details about how the room looks, etc.  Obviously when they&#39;re back in their body, they&#39;re blind again, but think of if it&#39;s just &quot;brains and chemicals, or lack of oxygen&quot;......how can a brain make a totally blind person see?  This is PROOF that we have souls that leave the body.<br><br>We are spirits wearing a meatsuit, like drivers inside a car.  You are not your body, you are the driver.  You volunteered to be here and have this life, and the study of NDE&#39;s helps us know where we came from and where we&#39;re going to.<br><br>I&#39;m reading some of these comments, and I&#39;m seeing a mountain of ignorance and desperation to explain these NDE&#39;s away as something false.  If you try to debunk NDE&#39;s, but you put no time into actually STUDYING the evidence for or against them, then you&#39;re an ignorant person who formulates opinions at the hip without ANY research into the subject.  You don&#39;t believe they&#39;re true because that makes atheists feel uncomfortable.  Atheists don&#39;t want any moral accountability so they dismiss NDE&#39;s away any way they can.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but if you bothered to STUDY the subject, you&#39;d find the irrefutable evidence that they&#39;re real.<br><br>There&#39;s lots of NDE&#39;s where blind/deaf people (from birth) are able to see and hear amazingly during their NDE.  They come back to their body blind/deaf again, but explain how &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; can make a blind/deaf person see/hear perfectly?<br><br>There&#39;s &quot;shared NDE&#39;s&quot; where family members share visions of a relative who&#39;s passing right there.  How can &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; do that?<br><br>There&#39;s been cases of people on operating tables, getting brain surgery, blood totally drained from their head, ZERO brain activity (machines are actually monitoring the brain activity) but there was nothing.  Yet they come back sharing details of what the doctors said/did.  How&#39;s that possible for &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; to do that with no blood in the brain?<br><br>There&#39;s other cases, where people describe things impossible to know if it&#39;s just &quot;brains and chemicals&quot; like seeing what clothes a relative is wearing as they&#39;re rushing to the hospital to talk to the patient before they pass.  They saw what clothes the relatives were wearing and what the conversation was in the car.<br><br>Many many people have seen details happening in the room/scene that can be corroborated with first responders or others that are there.  Thus proving they aren&#39;t making it up, and proving they saw/heard something while their body is dead and not in a position to see or hear this detail.<br><br>You can talk to any ICU or Hospice nurse and they will tell you crazy unbelievable stories they&#39;ve witnessed.  I&#39;m sorry if details from NDE&#39;s scare you or don&#39;t align with what you want your world to be like.  I&#39;m sorry if you want to continue to be selfish, continue to look at porn, and just continue to sin in general.  This stuff is real, and the evidence is there.  If you actually STUDY NDE&#39;s without being foolish and dismissing them without studying them, then it&#39;s your problem when you eventually die and you discover they were all correct.<br><br>You better correct your selfish life and turn from sin while you still can.  You AREN&#39;T going to like where you end up.  <br><br>God doesn&#39;t send people to Hell, they send themselves there.  God provides a way OUT of it."

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-25,When my wife was bleeding out during her surgery she did the floating above the operating room thing.  Woke up a week later.
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-07-13,"&quot;a lot of people who die and come back, say that everything is more real on the other side, and once back, being back seems more dreamlike.&quot;<br><br>When I was about 6 years old, I had a very high fever. I believe I probably died. <br>I saw a woman I&#39;d never seen when it happened. <br>Nobody, and I do mean that, nobody since then, was as happy to see me, as she was. I&#39;m 53 now. <br><br>She was ecstatic to see me, the look on her face, the smile was so amazing. I remember her JOY, and her vibrancy. I don&#39;t remember exactly what her facial features looked like, I mainly just remember her JOY!, long dk brn hair, very beautiful ! <br>About 46 years later now, and nobody has been that happy to see me since. Lol<br><br>Later I found out, my dad&#39;s only sister, passed away, when HE was that age. She passed away with a very high fever. She had long dk brn hair, very beautiful. <br><br>She used to protect my dad from the cold when he was little, so he wouldn&#39;t catch a fever, when thieves would steal the coal. She cuddled him, and they could see their breath."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2025-01-22,Why is it nearly impossible watch this out of the US? I can‚Äôt buy or see it in other stores. Really wanted to see this.

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2025-01-16,Excellent movie. I only wish that they had not done the stories in a way that begins the story and then jumps to another story and then goes back to the first story. I wish they finished every story and then started another one

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-03,"I had a NDE.. The crickets melted into one sound, which sounded like the flatline on a vital monitor in an ambulance.. The industrial AC sounded like my frames per second dropping down to 0. I saw the end of humanity, everyone who ever existed or will, is here in this tunnel, formed out of their bodies in this black just, nothingness. They formed a tube of the rest of humanity and they aren&#39;t wearing any skin - the outside is just humans with their backs turned toward me - muscles exposed. One of them turned around  and is now facing me, still just muscle..  He told me that the only way we humans made it to the end of everything, is because &quot;we rose together, or else, we would&#39;ve fallen apart.&quot; However there was nothing left to do at this point. The Universe .. Everything...  Was ending , it was the end of all of it. They allowed me to enter the entirety of this tunnel of humanity and become part of them. Now, as I&#39;m looking inward to this tube, I look left and I look right, and it just goes on for infinity... We were all connected, holding each other together so tightly, that not even the void of space could penetrate us. But it&#39;s still the end; So as I&#39;m digesting what&#39;s happening, the human next to me looks at me and says, &quot;If this is the last breath of humanity, we breathe it together.&quot; By this point, I had accepted what&#39;s going on by now... and so, I take one big final deep breath along with every other human; and we all exhale as everything fades to dark.<br><br>Suddenly, there was nothing. It wasn&#39;t long, it wasn&#39;t forever, it wasn&#39;t infinite. It was just.. blank. It was Nothingness. Like trying to remember what it was like before you were born. <br>Then after possibly eons of &quot;nothing&quot;, a void, a total absence of everything including time itself, I remember taking and hearing my first breath. It was almost unfamiliar, I remember thinking ever so slightly, &quot;was that a breath?&quot; and then it happened, again, I felt second one... And then I remembered I used to be alive... But I died.. And I thought to myself  &quot;No way.. it&#39;s impossible that I&#39;m breathing.&quot; I thought, let me try and see if I can do it a third time... If I can take a third breath, I&#39;m not dead. I took my third breath and every other one since, even as I type this. My first thoughts were that we could be anything, we could be farmers, race car drivers, parents, mechanics, or CEOs.  We can do stuff... We&#39;re not dead yet, this is not the end. Humans have what it takes to make it to the end of everything, so we need to rewire how we see ourselves. Anything is possible as long as we draw a breath. As long as we breathe, we can attempt to achieve anything, because it&#39;s not over yet."

After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-05,"Brains are incredible, and human brains are insanely incredible. Brains are also liars. Just read about saccades and how brains process, edit, and censor everything you see, it&#39;ll change your perspective. A person near death still receives information from their surroundings and constructs a beautiful narrative to calm the person. Everyone knows by now that death is peaceful. No matter how violent the event, your brain just starts shutting and numbing everything down. Cherish your loved ones and spend time with them while they&#39;re still alive."

In my opinion, the movie is very accurate.    Watch the movie, then draw your own conclusions about it.    Do not let religion hold you back.      It&#39;s a complex subject.    It&#39;s definitely worth your time.    <br>FOOTNOTE:   My 52 year old son died of brain cancer August 27, 2023 (two months ago).   Since then, I have had five contact signs from him letting me know he is OK.    Two dream contacts, two animal contacts,  and one from the movie After Death.   Amazing...   :)"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-03-24,I&#39;m waiting for this
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-06-26,I really would like to hear/read Near Death Experiences from people who don&#39;t believe in a God. What did they see and feel?
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-09,"Have a look at Rabbi Alon Anava his experiences and back story are very different,  he is now observant"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-06-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMMAnO67RPw&amp;t=123"">2:03</a> <b>Hand of God coming to getcha!!!</b>"
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-11-03,Will it release on Netflix?
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-02-04,Where can i watch thiS
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-09-28,Ok how do I buy tickets to this??!!
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-23,Can anyone tell me the song track they used?
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-04-17,"Near death experiences are reported everywhere in the world, and many doctors and nurses admit that those unbelivable things are real. But it does not prove that life could continue to exist even after death. We need to wait to know the truth."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-22,Very interested to see this film
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-04-21,"I remember I was kicked in the chest I fell down(sat down) with my back against the cabinet-when I came to I asked how long was I out ,was told about five seconds. No kidding it felt like half an hour."
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2023-10-05,Can we see this in the UK?
After Death,wMMAnO67RPw,2024-03-03,"There were some pretty interesting arguments and testimonies. And then it‚Äôs immediately watered down by the nutcase that describes an entire scenario or going to hell, getting saved, then being shown a ‚Äúrecording‚Äù of his life while they get upset with him over his poor choices LMAOOOO"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-21,very impressed by jacob elordi&#39;s ability to make me immediately forget about every other role he&#39;s played
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Another fine addition to the ‚ÄúBarry Keoghan playing a weird little guy‚Äù cinematic universe.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-22,The trailer somehow has me convinced the family baited an innocent person into their world of horror and the family also unknowingly invited a monster into their strange world.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-25,"Saw this movie a few days ago. So so happy we finally have a trailer that doesn‚Äôt spoil anything in the movie, wish all movie trailers were like this!!! Loved this movie so much"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-22,Saltburn is a 10/10 and is the psychological thriller we&#39;ve been needing.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-19,How each character captures the nuanced awkward moments in their voices and body language and make them memorable with the mind blowing trailer soundtrack. The posters are already iconic. Love it all
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-21,This was one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever watched. So many scenes were just... breathtaking.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so‚Ä¶ real‚Äù<br><br>As a working class girl who managed to worm her way into a private school, I know exactly what she meant"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-20,"at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lALMdJf6UUE&amp;t=50"">0:50</a> elspeth turns to felix when she says &quot;you&#39;re kind about everyone&quot; and turns to Oliver when she says &quot;you can&#39;t be trusted&quot;. wonderful foreshadowing!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-16,"One of the most unique and strange films ive ever seen, going in completely blind is the best way to experience this film"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"Fun Fact : Saltburn is Rosamund Pike and Carey Mulligan&#39;s third collaboration after Pride &amp; Prejudice and An Education. That alone is enough for me to be interested, it&#39;s always exciting to see the Bennet sisters reunite in a new project üôå"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"From being a nurse in Call The Midwife to being season 2 showrunner and executive producer of Killing Eve to being Camilla Bowles in The Crown Season 3 and 4 to getting a directorial debut in Promising Young Woman that earned her an Oscar win for the script to playing Midge in the recent Barbie movie to making Saltburn, Emerald Fennell is a fascinating artist üôå"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-26,"Barry Keoghan is outstanding in this role, this is the role he deserves a nomination for."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-04-15,Honestly had NO expectations and turned out to be one of the best movies in recent years. CLASSIC to me.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-07,Don‚Äôt know why but this trailer scratches an itch in my brain that I didn‚Äôt know I had. The entire vibe and aesthetic of this trailer gives me goosebumps everytime I watch this trailer. I‚Äôm up to my 20th watch
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"Oh I mean seriously, who else don&#39;t get &#39;The Secret History&#39; vibes?! <br><br>A poor, scholar kid drawn towards elegance and beauty but the underexperienced youth keeps him unaware of the fact that a true beauty has it own horror and is quite capable of haunting you for the rest of your life. <br><br>Oh I&#39;m so very excited to experience this, hopefully, a marvelous artwork."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-24,If you haven&#39;t seen it. I am so glad that we still have good movies being made every now and then. This is definitely one of them. I masterpiece with great actors and fantastic story. Loved it! üëçüëçüèÜ
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-20,"Another great looking movie, never to be seen by those who always complain how everything is a sequel or a remake."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-30,The cinematography of this movie is insane.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-09,"Just came to say this js the best film this year. After countless remakes how refreshing to see a film with an incredible ensemble, acting and amazing storyline"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Rosamund is phenomenal as always
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Saw this movie last week. What a phenomenal and intense movie! I can‚Äôt wait to see it again when it comes out.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-06,"Wow, I love these types of trailers. So intriguing without giving away too much."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-26,"Dark, twisted, gripping and original. One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen for a long time which didn&#39;t have me looking at my phone once throughout!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-20,"This movie was SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD!!!! Utterly spellbinding. If you haven&#39;t watched it, do so, and do not read anything about it. I watched it cold without even seeing the trailer or knowing what is was about, which was the best way to watch it."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Promising Young Woman was one of my favourite movie of 2020 and earned Emerald Fennell a well deserved screenplay Oscar win so i&#39;m definitely excited to see what&#39;s her next movie and i think this looks pretty fascinating. Can you believe that the filmmaker behind this movie and PYM is the same person who played Camilla Bowles in The Crown season 3 and 4? That&#39;s actually pretty impressive ü§ó
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Another episode of Barry Keoghan being a weird guy and Rosamund Pike as a questionable MOTHER
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-30,"I have to admit, I watched this movie because I heard about all the crazy scenes. I never expected to like it. I LOVED it. It&#39;s like the &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; for a new generation and on speed. This was a gem. Brilliantly acted and so vibrant. One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-13,"Saw it this Tuesday, and it is amazing. I was caught off guard and completely shocked by the plot twists and turns of this film. Highly recommended"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-11-22,"gosh.. jacob elordi plays his roles SOOO well. this movie.. honestly i dont know how to feel about it. it gave me soo many emotions, one after the other."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-24,This trailer really pulls you in like I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie. Idk if it‚Äôs the music or Barry Keoghan‚Äôs eyes but I know it‚Äôs gonna be awesome!
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,From Kissing booth to this ! Now that&#39;s a step up for Jacob Elordi
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-30,Keoghan is fantastic actor. He will get an Oscar it just a matter of time.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-30,I was shocked at how good this film is. A diamond in the rough. Amazing.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-19,This movie was incredible. It&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen all year.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,This movie looks absolutely gorgeous
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-30,"Saw this at the london film festival, it was hands down one of the best British black comedies ive ever seen"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,Talented Mr. Ripley vibes. With its own dash of flavor.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-05-09,This twised delight is the best film in I don&#39;t know how long for me. Ominous and a frightfully accurate peek into upper class British lives. Superb performances from every single character. Each relevant and exceptionally well portrayed. Bravo. 100/10.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-02-18,"absolutely darkly brilliant movie, could watch a million times and still not be able to appreciate all the subtle detail and incredibly cinematographic work in this film."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-06,One of the best films I&#39;ve seen. Brilliant acting from everyone and spellbinding direction.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-06,This movie is incredible. I‚Äôm such a movie critic so don‚Äôt doubt it. Just watch it. Thumbs up to the cast
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-03-16,"just finished watching the movie, have a whole &quot;Parasite&quot; vibe. got chills on my spine and jaw-dropping"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-03-19,"When he unkowingly invited a monster into his home, felt sad for the family:((( this is a masterpiece‚ù§ a mustwatch"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-20,"Only just found out Carey Mulligan is in this as well!!<br>So glad she‚Äôs reuniting with Emerald Fennell, she steals every scene she‚Äôs in!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-08,Jacb Elordi really impressed me here his acting was superb and all of the performances were equally superb and the movie kept me guessing until the end.  I just wish they had left out the last 15 minutes to keep me guessing after the movie was over what really happened.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-21,I just finished watching it and it‚Äôs a rollercoaster ride of a film. It‚Äôs going to get mixed reviews. Can also understand if someone says that it‚Äôs batshit crazy
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-23,Barry Keoghan has arrived. I noticed him in the Banshees of Inesherin (hes arguably the best part of that film) the other night and realized that ive really liked him in everything ive seen him in. I cant wait to see Saltburn.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-21,the cinematography in this movie is just breathtaking.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-25,"Promising Young Woman was a masterpiece so I can¬¥t wait for this one, Emeral Fennel is an amazing director"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-20,"I think this movie looks so fascinating and very intriguing, plus rosemund pike is in it, definitely a must see."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"&quot;A Glossy Dynamite bends my mind&quot; ‚ù§<br>Saltburn feels like a dynamite that is embellished by the sparkling elements. The Cinematography catches the heart in its glitter and flicker. Can&#39;t wait to see the stellar performer Barry Keoghan and the charming Jacob Elordi. The cast is captivating. Emerald Fennell has brought a delectable spectacle with so much crazy delights, just excited to watch this."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-10-20,"I love my favorite character Farleigh Start, my black gangsta! A real good powerful, emotional, caring, redeemable superhero. Justice for Farleigh in this building! üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èüè∞"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-02-07,Just watched this and I think it&#39;s an absolute masterpiece. Surprised it hasn&#39;t been better received. Highly recommended.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-24,"I just got done watching this and came straight to the comments to say that this movie waz EPIC. It was a really great time beginning to end. I&#39;ve been looking for a decent movie or series to watch for weeks. <br>10/10 even.just for the end scene alone (had a woman been in that scene instead, it would have been same old, same old) not to mention the rest of the movie which really shows that it&#39;s possible to make good films in today&#39;s world. I was beginning to lose hope. <br><br>Barry Keoghan is BOLD! What a great artsy psychological thriller for a change. I meed to find more on this level. <br>This was phenomenal, way to go! Thank you for actually making a worthwhile film that deserves recognition. <br>Highly recommend!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-04,As a brit I must say Jacob Elordi‚Äôs accent is really quite impressive.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-25,‚ÄúShe came from Greece. She had a thirst for knowledge. It couldn‚Äôt have been me. I‚Äôve never wanted to know anything.‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-12-04,I love that the trailer and the beginning of the movie gives you a completely different impression than what the reality is.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-03,This movie definitely lives up to the hype. Underrated masterpiece
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,you can&#39;t tell me that this isn&#39;t THE SECRET HISTORY &amp; Brideshead Revisitedüò©‚ù§. her saying &quot;I HAVE A COMPLET AND UTTER HORROR OF UGLINESS&quot; is basically Richard saying &quot;THAT HE HAS A MORBID LONGING FOR THE PICTURESQUE AT ALL COSTS AND THAT IS HIS FATAL FLAW&quot;  WITH THE REST OF THE SECRET HISRTORY&#39;S characters ...TEH CENEMATOGHRPY IS BRILLIANT...THIS IS TRUE CINEMA THAT WE&#39;VE MISSED DEARLY FOR YEARS I HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-04-04,Saltburn was totally robbed by the Oscars.   It deserved many nominations.  Emerald Fennell is a terrific writer who pushed the boundaries.   A great and disturbing film for thinking grownups.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-02-03,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lALMdJf6UUE&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> no way they didn‚Äôt know what they were doing"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-07-08,"Celkovƒõ trailer k &quot;Saltburn&quot; slibuje siln√Ω, nap√≠nav√Ω thriller, kter√Ω zaujme svou atmosf√©rou, v√Ωkony a promy≈°len√Ωm p≈ô√≠bƒõhem. Je to film, na kter√Ω se rozhodnƒõ vyplat√≠ tƒõ≈°it"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-04-01,Why do people think this movie is trying to be deeper than it is? It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a black comedy and it&#39;s hilarious! I really liked it. It was beautiful to look at and the acting was great. Good music too.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-25,"I keep seeing posts where people thought it was going to be a &quot;fun movie about friendship.&quot; Did they only watch the first half of this trailer?? But also, wow, what a movie! Hilariously brilliant! And brilliantly hilarious! And shocking! It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve truly been shocked. And Barry K is remarkable!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-03-24,the cinematography in this movie is to DIE FOR
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-31,The actors alone make this worth checking out. What a cast
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-02,"If Gone Girl &amp; Cruel Intentions had a baby, it would be Saltburn. Absolutely brilliant in every way."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-01,A modern-day Talented Mr. Ripley. Epic performance by everyone.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-23,"It was twisted, hilarious and absolutely deranged. I watched it last night on Prime and loved it, you go into it expecting one thing and it is everything but. Lots of underlying themes and subtleties, highly recommended. Oh and the soundtrack is spectacular!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-03-28,"the films alright, nothing masterpiece worthy but its a good watch imo"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,A 21st-century ‚ÄòBrideshead Revisited.‚Äô And what a delicious treat too! üëç
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-18,This movie was amazing. You really cannot pick a side. Both sides are fleshed out. That&#39;s rarely done in films like this.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-30,Watched Priscilla yesterday and Saltburn today. Jacob Elordi truly has an impressive range.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"Carrey Mulligan looks nuts in this, i cant wait"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-23,My God the cinematography is just captivating.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,I‚Äôm so freaking confused but so excited
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-10,For me this film is quite the masterpiece and already one of my favourite movies.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-10-09,im a fan this lil guy and im def watching this
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-13,Okay I was not expecting all of that. Although I thought it was cliche yet it gives such phenomenal cinematography.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-13,"I‚Äôm just impressed there is a movie with an intense 2.5 minute trailer and we still don‚Äôt know the plot. I‚Äôm shocked silly! Who knew people still made trailers like this. Now I actually want to see the movie, as opposed to feeling like I already saw it."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-30,63 f and just finished this magnificent film ‚Ä¶ i absolutely loved it ‚Ä¶ one to watch again ‚ù§
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-18,"Barry Keoghan is an amazing actor , as always, but Jacob Elordi really really impressed me with his performance‚Ä¶..well done!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-19,"I got to go to an early screening last night, it was FANTASTIC!!!"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-29,"Saw this at my local indie theater on Monday. What a weird, beautifully shot, somewhat icky little movie. I enjoyed it, though. Loved Barry Keoghan&#39;s performance, and Carey Mulligan had me laughing just about every time she was on screen. I&#39;d definitely see it again."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-29,I just watched this movie today. I really enjoyed it! However I can see why some may not. Each of the actors did an amazing job. I could see some getting awards because of their performances.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-01-02,"It felt like another version of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;! Absolutely hated the movie but IN LOVE with the cast performances, they nailed it."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-30,Just watched this. Endings really do make a movie complete. Brilliant movie.
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-28,"I was skeptical at first, but after seeing him in this, I am VERY excited to see what Barry does with the Joker"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-10-20,"I watched this at a film festival and loved it. Fairly shallow, reads as more of a hate letter to the middle classes than a scathing ‚Äòeat the rich‚Äô thriller (but what can you expect when the writer/director comes from money herself lol). Super funny though, they should be marketing it as a dark comedy, and a total visual feast as seen in this trailer. Really great performances from the main cast."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-04,"A sort of &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; movie. Excellent, very well done and acted. Very recommendable."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-03,i haven‚Äôt seen it yet but have read the spoilers &amp; the way she looks at jacob elordi‚Äôs character &amp; says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre kind about everyone‚Äù then looks at the other guy &amp; says ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be trusted‚Äù
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-02-23,I&#39;m addicted to listening to this trailer
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-29,"After having watched this movie, I immediately want to watch everything Barry Keoghan has ever been in. He may well be the actor of his generation"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-07-14,breathtaking shots and story
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-11,"This truly does look amazing, LOVE Rosamund Pike ‚ù§"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2025-01-11,Now Barry Keoghan  is going to be THE JOKER I am amazed
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2024-05-05,"I&#39;ll never understand why so many people want to watch this type of movie, especially in today&#39;s world. How are you not so disgusted with what is happening in our actual world that you can sit and watch a movie that was made from these exact ideas?"
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-11-11,"Just the cast and the writer &amp; director made me excited for the movie.<br>The trailer seems intriguing, really looking forward for this."
Saltburn,lALMdJf6UUE,2023-12-26,"What‚Äôs make it great is it‚Äôs very different, and quietly shocking with the nuanced dialogue and the disgusting nature of some selected scenes. It‚Äôs also very well acted by everyone in it too."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,"&quot;Even simply brushing clothes with someone is fate&quot; (Ïò∑ÍπÉÎßå Ïä§Ï≥êÎèÑ Ïù∏Ïó∞) is an old Korean proverb that means every interaction between you and another person‚Äîeven a stranger on the street‚Äîis never an accident, but rather the elaborate result of your past lives and theirs intertwining to make that momentary interaction happen. And if even the most seemingly trivial of interactions are the result of elaborate workings of fate (Ïù∏Ïó∞), then something as significant as meeting the love of your life is the result of 8000 Í≤Å of fate. This is a commonly known Buddhist teaching. Í≤Å (Gup) is a measurement of time. Imagine a massive boulder, and imagine that a single raindrop falls on that boulder once every 1000 years. The amount of time it would take for the boulder to finally crack from the water droplets is 1 Í≤Å. A single Í≤Å is an unfathomably long period of time, so 8000 Í≤Å is something that&#39;s hard to even attempt to imagine. The saying goes that for every married couple, there&#39;s at least 8000 Í≤Å of Ïù∏Ïó∞ (fate) from their past lives that led them to each other."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-08-24,"‚ÄúYou make my world so much bigger, and I‚Äôm wondeing if I do the same for you.‚Äù <br>One of my fav. quote in the movie."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"This is just a trailer and the chemistry between the characters is off the charts, incredible!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-08-26,This movie is just sooo realistic that even their stares and no words just gives you a ton of emotions. It left a hole in my heart
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Got chills from the trailer, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be crying at the end of the movie"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Was lucky enough to see this at Sundance. You guys aren&#39;t ready. It&#39;s simply beautiful.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Hey, I&#39;m from South Korea and I can relate to this trailer... Almost same thing happened to me recently. Around 17 years ago, when I was in elementary, I met a boy whose name was &quot;Present&quot; in Korean. He was my first crush. I liked his shiny round eyes, a cute wide smile, and white teeth. Sadly, I had to move to another  school a year later. 18 years passed, and we met each other this January. We have become both 25. He studies in medical school and I just came back to S.Korea after obtaining a diploma from another country. I didn&#39;t know he had been reading all my posts on my public diary for a few months when I was back in France. Though he knew the one who was writing the diary was me, he never said &quot;Hi&quot; to me. Then one day I deleted a link that had access to my public diary, so he missed a chance to let me know. <br>A few years passed, and he noticed one comment in the comment section of one youtube video which showed a whole view of our hometown where we used to play together. That comment was, surprisingly, written by me. He noticed that it was me because I wrote down some of my personal background in the comment. He already knew I was living in France and I had a very special surname that stood out. <br>So we met each other once again through Youtube and we talked hours and hours on social media. We finally met each other this January and we had a nice Italian lunch, drank coffee and talked for hours and hours... I think we had a nice time. <br>We are not together tho. Maybe it was because of a bad timing or maybe because I&#39;ve been having some issues with my mentality and physical health or maybe because he was in senior year at medical school...or maybe because I seemed such a deep person to him. BUT the important thing is, I have a feeling that we are still connected and one day we will see each other once again at right time and a right place.<br>Magic happens to those who believe in magic :)<br>Anyways, thank you for reading my magical storyüíõ"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-09,don&#39;t mind me... i just keep coming back to this trailer when i want to feel heartbroken.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-03-03,"Reconnected with my love after almost 10 years apart this past fall in NYC (I‚Äôm thirty). Coincidentally, the first time we saw each other we also ended up in Brooklyn and took pictures in the same places they are taking pictures in the movie with the bridge in the background. <br><br>Circumstances took her across the world. I always knew she was the one and on starry nights, red sunsets, during milestones and in silent moments of reflection, I would wonder if I was still in her heart as she was in mine. <br><br>When we finally met up, I remember gazing into her eyes for hours searching for answers, we said so much to each other without saying a single word. Turns out, I have been in her heart as much as she‚Äôs been in mine. <br><br>3 months later this past January I travelled to meet her family. We‚Äôre hoping to get engaged mid year and planning a wedding for early 2024. Timing is everything and in our hearts and in our core, we always hoped to be each others forevers.<br><br>Update: We got married in Feb 2024"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,"Oh I love how the movie basically describes how you can still hold that love, reminiscing all the good memories, but you both know that you don&#39;t need to be together at the end anyway. Because those beautiful memories and feelings are only enough to keep you satisfied and happy with what you two have now."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,"Well, someone just NAILED the casting for this one. 2 minutes, 24 seconds and the chemistry is rock solid. No need for over the top dialogue when you have such amazing body language. Soundtrack puts the nail in &#39;emotional&#39; coffin.     Can&#39;t wait"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-17,The last scene broke my heart into 8000 pieces.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,That last scene. It‚Äôs the awkward affection and love you still have for someone. It‚Äôs distant but also close.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Romance movies are not generally something I seek out, but it looks like the themes in this go deeper than the standard romance film. I am excited to see this!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-12,The quick cut at the end showing them as kids was sublime. Gave me chills. There they are once again the two kids standing together but also apart on their divergent paths. The memory now in nighttime mirroring their present was beautiful visual poetry. A realization that their feelings for each other can only exist in a time and space both real and imaginary. Kudos to Celine Song.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-11-16,"I just finished watching this movie, and it made me bawl my eyes out like a baby. Not because it counted on big, dramatic scenes but on all those little in-betweens that we all have in our lives, those moments where we are out of words, those in which we want to say something but can&#39;t and those where we say something different from what we want to. It was so emotionally charged, it made me feel deeply for- and with them and most of all, it left me thinking and feeling and also aching."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,"Whilst watching this trailer, I can say that at this point I&#39;m fully convinced that A24 can never disappoint us with their films."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-14,"Saw this yesterday and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so moved by a film, I started crying from the very first scene and didn‚Äôt stop until 15 mins after it ended. but it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs dreary or depressing, just so heartfelt and deeply relatable. Such a masterpiece of a film my heart aches remembering it."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,"Teo Yoo with his emotional eyes, charming smile above all this man&#39;s voice, OMG! he is the perfect cast for that role . All the actors portraying their roles so realistic, definitely would need boxes of tissues for sure to watch this :("
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-10-23,"This was a really good movie. I thought about it for days after watching it. The feeling she had at the end hit close to home. Good job once again, A24."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA244xewjcI&amp;t=50"">0:50</a> this scene definitely got me, that first meeting was so strong. The chemistry is already perfect, i feel like I felt all of their emotions inside me. I&#39;m ready to cry, the vibe is so real, it&#39;s already painful. This movie will definitely leave a beautiful scar."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-02,"When she exhaled at the end and broke down it was the perfect climax of all the energy, tension, hope, love, frustration that she built up. I somehow felt it built up with the audience too"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-04-18,"I think what makes this movie big is that it captures all the small, intimate moments that make up romance. It‚Äôs so beautiful to watch!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-11-03,"Many people in the cinema wiped their tears (me too). The emotion of love literally skyrockets at the very end of the film. Although I  live in Slovenia, which is on the other side of the world, the emotion of love, and the language between two hearts, seems to be exactly the same, everywhere."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"i felt butterflies just by watching this trailer... this is so relatable for both sides, i mean... we all can see ourselves in his situation, bur also at hers, who wouldn&#39;t want to see again some childhood love?<br>crazy, cant wait to see it."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-28,"Among all the superhero movies around us, A24 never seems to fail to deliver real stories."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-05-23,"Wow.  Anyone who has experienced a strong, deep mutual romantic connection with someone, but who knew that it could never be for whatever reason, will instantly connect with this trailer, and I presume the film."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-10-25,This film was beautiful and honest. I love this Korean proverb and the idea that we are all connected somehow. It‚Äôs making me appreciate all the short interactions that I have everyday. It‚Äôs given them a new beauty. <br>Can‚Äôt wait to watch this movie again someday.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Can&#39;t wait to watch it. I&#39;ve heard that it was the best movie viewed at Sundance. The concept is gripping. Chills would go through my spine at the thought of meeting my crush 20 years later. So beautiful characters.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-25,It literally brought me to tears. Poetic in a way gently telling a story that channels through 30+ years of life. It‚Äôs a friendship built upon the trust and transcends into a caring love. Not about control nor any resentments! Courage at last that puts two of them spiritually connected but also disconnected with nothing but best wishes!
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-03-26,"Every husband&#39;s worst fear is finding out you were just....easy to live with and her heart was elsewhere. Her smiles that never touched her eyes, the lack of conversation on date night, or missing quiet shared moments. The feeling of being alone when she&#39;s right next to you...let it go. Let her go. She&#39;s too afraid to say it herself. She doesn&#39;t have to heart...but maybe you don&#39;t either."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-10-17,Didn&#39;t expect this movie would be so good. The last moment was heart piercing.<br>What a natural cinematography. You feel like you were there.<br>This is a movie that stays in your memory and feelings
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,I am so excited for this! Past Lives was everyone&#39;s favourite movie at The Sundance
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,"From Love to Hate You - to this movie that really looks promising, I love that Teo Yoo is gaining mainstream traction! And he&#39;s not doing it by playing cliche movies/dramas, but he&#39;s taking on projects that are so unique and beautiful! Tbh I only got to know him from his very female empowering drama, Love to Hate You  but seeing this trailer, I think I&#39;m gonna keep an eye out for him from now on. I&#39;m a new fan! &lt;3"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-04,"I saw this film today with my wife.  It was beautifully done. The story rang so true, the love, pain, fear and hopes of the main characters were so we&#39;ll portrayed by the actors, the camera and the wisdom of the writer/director.  The subject matter, experienced by so many, was very well expressed.  Congratulations!  And, Thank You."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2025-01-28,Every once and awhile a movie comes out that captures how beautiful life is. This is one of those of those movies.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-05-12,"Saw this last night as the opening film for the Seattle International Film Festival and was just utterly blown away. Such an absolutely beautiful film‚ÄîI&#39;m so impressed by how Celine Song is completely unafraid to allow a moment to just...breathe. And how her characters convey so much with just a look or a gesture, negating the need for dialogue. <br><br>Adding to the overall feel of the film was the score, which had an ethereal quality that made it feel as if you were watching the story unfold as if in a dream. Just stunning. If you have a chance to go see this film, I highly recommend it!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-26,"I just saw this film this past weekend, and I cried like a baby. It definitely tugged at my heart strings because I have been through something similar. The movie is slow, but with a purpose. It‚Äôs not slow as in boring. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre taking in every single emotion. You feel the desire, the anxiousness, the warmth, the comfort and the pain of both characters. Absolutely heartfelt, a story many could relate to, as I do üò¢myself. I believe that there is a soulmate that you connect with out there. And if you can‚Äôt be with that soulmate, you will never find true love again. Just a brilliant film."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,This studio is doing amazing work breathing life back into cinema for this genre of movie and story telling. I hope it plays at my Regal theater.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-03,"When Hae Sung called Nora one last time, he also knew that that was the last time he was going to see her. The flashback made me cry instantly. You could see that both of them wanted to go back in time - to be 12 year olds again. The ending was really sad and I wish it ended differently."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-28,"Once in a lifetime type of movies. I just watched it a few hours ago this movie has me so emotional. I always wonder what could have been with my ex if the circumstances were different. This is one of the best movies in the past 30 years. Celine and the cast did an amazing job. They deserve best director, best actor and best actress."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,This is going to wreck me and heal me at the same time. So many buried emotions just resurfaced from the trailer alone. I&#39;m so excited about this movie and Celine Song&#39;s future!
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-06,"Update: The most intimate, heartwarming, and real film I&#39;ve ever seen. Both funny and bittersweet, the writing and cast make you smile and cry about the nuances of love in practice. Went to watch it last weekend on opening, and its been on my mind since. Celine Song, Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro are the perfect combination of people for depicting how circumstances so often out of our hands can both bring together and break apart the most perfect combinations of people."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-17,I saw this at TIFF. One of the most beautiful and touching movies I have ever seen. It&#39;s poetry in motion and I was so moved by how the characters conveyed so much without saying too much. This will remain a lifetime favourite film of mine ü•∞
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Another perfect film from A24 is never a bad thing!
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,I just got teary watching the trailer. Maybe because I left Korea 40 years ago. I was just a kid then. I didn‚Äôt have childhood crush either but there is something about this trailer that is so subtle and delicate that touches me straight to the core. <br>I can‚Äôt wait to see it on cinema.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-26,"Ïù∏Ïó∞ is one of my favorite words in Korean, and I loved hearing it often when I was in Korea. It speaks to the depth of how Koreans think of relationships and the word comes from Buddhist teachings. It is nice to see a film that will speak on that. I am also looking forward to the Korean-American mix of thinking in this film. I just hope she does not leave her husband. I just hope they meet each other as friends and it is a good memory but I hope she is faithful. I am looking forward to seeing this film."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2024-01-01,This movie was everything I expected it to be. Those long takes and shot selection paired with the performances really brings the film alive. I like how simple and straight to the point the writing is (I say this because it‚Äôs similar to something I‚Äôve experienced before. It may have not been simple and straightforward for everyone) while also having some thought provoking moments at the same time. Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a while for sure
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-13,"This film was absolutely amazing! It really touches your soul and it&#39;s realistic. If you&#39;ve had or are experiencing a similar situation as the characters, this film can move you deeply. I&#39;m so glad I got to experience it in theaters, if you&#39;re reading this and are curious, definitely run and go watch it too, it&#39;s a great film experience!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Reminds me of the sequence in Yi Yi when the father meets up with a childhood friend and they seamlessly go through these ups and downs in what could have been. This looks beautiful!
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,I feel like this movie will break my heart no matter what happens at the end.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2024-01-04,"I just finished it and... I feel so empty inside, they legit left me staring at the screen for like 5 minutes straight still hoping for something even if the show had already finished. Nevertheless, the movie is way too realistic I loved the details of everything, their silence, body language, their stares, and the ending was what would&#39;ve happened in reality even if it was sad really. It&#39;s such a 10/10 movie"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Trailers like this provokes a lot emotions from me. Nostalgia, affection, sadness, loneliness, love. I know I&#39;m gonna love this and I can&#39;t wait!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,yup i&#39;m crying already üò≠
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-24,This trailer alone gave me chills. Only watching 2 min and I already felt myself enter their world. Can‚Äôt wait  to see this film in its entirety! üò≠
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-08-22,I just watched this film and it‚Äôs better than I expected it to be. Touches on something that most of us have experienced once in our life.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-03-12,Greta Lee‚Äôs career has been bubbling just beneath the surface for well over a decade at this point and I‚Äôve enjoyed everything she‚Äôs touched. I hope we get a lot more of her going forward because she is so damn versatile! Looks like a great film and she looks fantastic! I look forward to seeing it.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-16,"I just saw this movie last night!!! It was so, so good. I think it will join a handful of movies that I want to watch each year. Even the trailer, which I saw months ago, stayed with me. I&#39;m so glad I got the opportunity to see it and loved it. The cast, the camerawork, New York, the script."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-05,"An emotionally intelligent film. Throughout the movie I couldn&#39;t help but try to understand the underpinning theme of the story. One thing is true though, that it is deeply human to find, at some point in our lives, pragmatism and the ideals of our youth, warring within us. The two are in desperate conflict with each other. Each having their own set of goals, determined to declare victory over the other. Past Lives explores this duality through a very tender and wonderfully aesthetic screenplay. The film&#39;s score was amazingly unique as well. Every piece seemed to fit perfectly with the sentiment of the scene. I particularly enjoyed the constant nonverbal communication displayed between the two main characters. There were these frequent and silent moments shared between them that seemed to force the audience into those moments with them. To feel every passing second of them. Great film!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-22,"This was a very kind film, even the conflict was handled by the characters in a very kind way.  Very touching."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-05-07,"All of these comments are so beautifully written, just shows how real this story can be for anyone. June 2nd can&#39;t come fast enough."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-28,"I grew up in Japan and I had a childhood friend just like this movie! Our parents used to joke that we&#39;ll be a married couple when we grow up. Then we moved to California where I&#39;d spend a majority of my adult life. Sometimes when I look at my old photo albums and see our pictures together, I do wonder how he&#39;s doing or whether or not he still remembers me"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,I&#39;m so in love with this movie -- one of the best films I have seen in years. This movie alone has made Celine Song one of my favorite directors
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-11-23,"I just watched this movie, and I did it twice. I felt it so profoundly, and I found it hard at the same time. The movie said so much with so little. All the dialogue was kept to a minimum, but necessary. &#39;Love&#39; was submerged in the oceans of life filled with ambition and the pursuit of company. Here I am, bawling my eyes out, celebrating the visual poetry of real life and how human relations are found and lost and perhaps stayed apart."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,This is intense.  The spoken words alone... this will be painful but worth every tear.  Teo Yoo you deserve your flowers.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-10,"My emotion got hit again and again, I tried to hold it in throughout the movie but cried my eyes out at the very end after hearing what Haesung said to Nayoung, I said something like that to someone before only to realize later that it was just a foolish wish. We always think about &quot;What could/would have been if that day I did this instead of that? Would we have been together?&quot; but what good does it do when nothing can be changed now"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-04-08,"This is such a beautifully edited trailer. What a tender, compelling, sweet story. It feels so good to see something so tender and to have it move me too my core. The abrasiveness of life has been suffocating lately. The music, the storyline, and the vulnerability of the characters has me soaked in tears and so relieved to not be bombarded by crass vulgarity and violence. I want to find the fucking pause button on life and keep it solely on these tender, quiet, lovely, joyful, awe inspiring moments. I also appreciate when films pay such beautiful homage to cultural philosophies/wisdom such as this one regarding past lives and its poetic interpretation of our daily life."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-08-30,"I don&#39;t have anyone I can call my soulmate, but this movie, for some reason, made me feel like that person exists. Every scene in this movie is not to be missed. <br><br>Any movies similar to this? It&#39;s been a while since a movie made me feel this way."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-06,"Worked this young lady for a 12 hr shift on an ambulance and we had a connection that I&#39;ve never experienced.<br> I looked for her for 6 months after that shift and one day I walked into work and there she was. Our relationship lasted almost a year and just like that it was over. Many years later I&#39;ve come to realize she was the one that got away. Just like  in the movie, she is married now and lives in the Northeastern part of the states. I miss her dearly and the love we had. I often wonder if I will ever find someone that I will love on that level again. Perhaps in my next life I will meet the love of my life again. Maybe then it will be a different outcome."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,"&quot;Just because we dont talk,  doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think about you. I distance myself from you because I know I can&#39;t have you.&quot; <br>This ones gonna hurt, I can already see it."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-27,"I watched this tonight.  Very emotional, beautiful and poetic. <br>Teo Yoo gave an absolutely SHOW with his expressions of love while looking at Nora.<br>It made me think of the movie Supernova and the pure expressions of love on the 2 main character&#39;s faces ( Colin Firth &amp; Stanley Tucci)...  So touching, so relatable."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-14,I have watched this trailer more than I&#39;ll admit because the feelings it evokes in me are so visceral and nostalgic. &quot;What if&quot; lives within all of us. Beautiful. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Yoo Teo is such a good actor i cant wait to see him play the main lead ‚ú®
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,this song by Cat Power always gets me.  I listened to it on the plane ride back from visiting my  2 year old daughter.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-08-23,"I watched the movie last night and watched the trailer again  today, it still gave me chills. Amazing movie."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,The way they edit their trailers is a form of art in itself‚Ä¶<br>How can few minutes leave such impression ?
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-26,"Why am I crying and this is only the trailer? WTF<br><br>The shots, the light, the colors, the cinematography, the dialogues oh my, oh my, oh my<br><br>I need this film now! I want to suffer ! Give it to me"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Just saw this at the Berlin Film Festival and it was amazing! It really should win the competition, nothing else I saw came close. Such a beautiful adult drama. The husband character was my favourite, he dealt with the situation in such an empathetic way."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2024-02-03,In April  2024 who are watching this like meüò≠üí•
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-11,"I saw Past Lives at a film festival. It&#39;s an absolutely beautiful love story and I adored it! Everything for the acting to the cinematography to the writing is superb. Would be shocked if this isn&#39;t nominated for an Oscar. :)<br><br>As a side note: A24 is killing it and give me hope for filmmaking. They back such brilliant, ground-breaking films."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,Greta Lee is amazing and i love to see her in something like this.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-03-10,"I was repressing so much emotion  today and watching this has opened the floodgates at last... so beautiful in a way that breaks your heart endlessly and restores your faith endlessly. <br><br>If anyone could recommend any films on a similar wavelength, I&#39;d love to hear it!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-10-05,This movie really struck a chord in my heart. At the end it made me cry and made me think about the &quot;What if&quot;. Being in a relation with someone for a decade and to always think about the &quot;What if&quot;... made my heartache.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-26,"Goosebumps and crying just with the trailer. I can&#39;t wait to purchase a ticket to see Tae Yoo, Greta Lee, and this amazing cast!."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,A24 just does it for me everytime
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"the story, the cast, the words, the pictures, the lighting, the scores are all beautiful. Look forward to watch full movie."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2024-10-08,"That last scene, with just staring at each other till the taxi arrived, was one of the most beautiful scenes I&#39;ve ever seen. <br>I felt so sad for Aruther, I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t in his place, that scene when they started to talk with each other and ignore him broke my hurt, they didn&#39;t mean to do that but it was so sad. <br>I do blame her, she broke up with him and she searched for him, I felt sad for Sung the most."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-24,Ahhh I felt teary eyed just at the trailer. I can&#39;t wait to see this! I&#39;m so thankful for A24 letting filmmakers make their life stories
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-25,"Greta Lee is such a good actress, I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôs starting in what looks like a beautiful movie!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-28,I&#39;m already in love with this movie with just a trailer can&#39;t wait to watch it and the song in it makes it even better
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-02,"A cinematic masterpiece, defined by its simplicity and elegance. With a remarkable cast and a beautifully crafted narrative, the film delves into the depths of emotion, evoking a poignant sense of nostalgia for bygone love stories. This heartfelt journey through time will resonate with viewers, leaving them deeply moved by its portrayal of enduring romance and the echoes of the past. <br>‚ù§"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-22,"One of the greatest trailers ever made for the best movie of the year. Unbelievable how good a trailer can be in showing how good a movie is. A masterpiece, it demands to be seen."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Teoyoo really knows how to chose his projects well. I can already tell, I&#39;m going to like this movie a lot!"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-09-07,"Wonderful film, fantastic and unbelievably natural performances with superb non-verbal acting too. Poignant and beautifully understated. The simple stories are often the ones best told"
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-20,"When a trailer makes you cry, you know artists were involved in the making of something that will resonate with everyone&#39;s heart no matter what your heart went through."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-23,I don‚Äôt usually watch romance movies but dude- this looks absolutely stellar. I love A24 and their horror but this just seems like a beautifully haunting film. I‚Äôll be anticipating this one
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-07-05,"Wow, I must say the movie was absolutely great! Even though I typically don&#39;t like romance films, I strongly believe that today&#39;s cinema truly necessitates a movie like this one: simple with deep emotions and without exaggeration. The carefully crafted scenes, visually stunning shots, and music all meld together. The movie completely surrounds you, carrying you away like a calm stream. Personally, it left me completely astonished."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2024-11-22,Broke up recently with a great friend and wonderful girl who I thought could be the love of my life. She moved and we were doing long distance. It was hard and eventually didn&#39;t work out. This movie just makes me accept the feelings and emotions.
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-02-22,"Saw this at Sundance, truly an incredible film. Exceptionally shot for Celine Song‚Äôs debut feature-length film. Recommending this to everyone."
Past Lives,kA244xewjcI,2023-06-05,Saw it last night. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo were there for a Q&amp;A after. Incredible film

Suzume,g0JMPkn7Wuo,2024-08-29,"Can&#39;t find on Netflix here in India, Can someone help?"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,"This was so good, I was gripped. That was until Lightning McQueen flew and hit the post mid air."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-25,"Adam Driver is the new play-all-italian-enterpreneurs actor in Hollywood. From today, he is Adamo Guidatore for me."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-04,"I think Adam Driver was absolutely fantastic and held my interest the entire movie. Here the story is being told almost in first person from the perspective of Ferrari himself. The time period was fantastically done and totally believable. Very attractive scenery, sets , cinematography and actors. I loved the kid who played Piero Ferrari he was awesome. Very well done and absolutely should be seen on the big screen."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-29,"Having Penelope Cruz in the cast, one of the best of her generation, and still almost invisible in the trailer..."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,Had me until the cgi car crash at the endüòÇ
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-16,"&quot;My past is scarred with grief: father, mother, brother, sister, wife. My life is full of sad memories. I look back and I see my loved ones and among my loved ones I see the face of this great man: Gilles Villeneuve.&quot; Enzo Ferrari, 1982"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,Adam Driver looks fantastic in this.  Very excited to see it!
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-29,"As soon as &quot;Ferrari&quot; was advertised, I was excited to see it. I took my mom to see it new in theatres. <br><br>Adam Driver is a fantastic actor and Michael Mann is an amazing director. What sealed it for me were two interviews (one transcribed and one in person) with stunt coordinator Robert Nagel. <br><br>It was amazing to get a behind the scenes look at how the Ferrari company opened their records, and how alot of cars were hand built from scratch.<br><br>It was beautifully shot and acted, it was great to see Enzo&#39;s personal life, his wife, mistress, families and how it was all connected and effected everything.<br><br>The crash made me think of the Mercedes crash at LeMas in 1955.<br><br>I love cars and loved this movie."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-20,Oh man- the cinematography is totally out of this planet üòçüòç
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-07,The teaser is misleading... this movie is more drama/ romance than race or company history
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-23,"Can&#39;t work out which is more stunning, the Ferrari&#39;s or Penelope ?"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,Just from the trailer its clear this is probably 100x better than the Lamborghini movie.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-26,Adam Driver has grown into such an incredible actor since the Force Awakens; can&#39;t say the same for the rest.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-05-30,"Einer der wenigen super Filme der letzten Jahre den man sich mehrmals anschauen kann - habe aber von Ridley Scott nichts anderes erwartet. Klasse Film, tolle Biografie √ºber die Anf√§nge des Rennsports .."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-23,"This could be a really good way to make a connected movie series with all the biggest manufacturers in racing history. Ford vs Ferrari, now this then could do companies like Porsche, Audi and Mercedes. Then join them all together for a Le Mans race with all the teams"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-01,I had no idea that was Adam driver until it said his name. Like holy hell the transformation
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-21,"Saw this tonight at an AMC Early Access event, it was good! The racing scenes were visually stunning, I just wish there were more of them in the movie."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-18,"That&#39;s Adam Driver? Hard to recognize him, he looks legit. Can&#39;t wait to see this."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,Ozil would have also been a great cast for Enzo
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,"Wow, cannot wait for this film to be released!"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-09,I nearly choked laughing at the car crash CGI üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-02,"Excellent film!  Adam Driver, Penelope Cruz Oscar-winning material!  Loved the action/accidents!"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,Looks great and although I struggle with foreign movies I‚Äôd have preferred this in Italian with subtitles
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,This is precisely what I&#39;ve been seeking! A wealth of wisdom! - &quot;Challenges are the stepping stones to self-discovery.&quot;
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-22,Adam Driver really lives up to his name! üòÇ
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-03,Adam is one of the best actors of this generation.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-10-08,"This movie was very impressive. Adam Driver really nailed it , once again. üíØ"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-20,That CGI crash at the end is so bad it looks like one of the cows from Twister (1996)
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-01,"Adam Driver just won himself an Oscar. Havent seen this, but it&#39;s the type of role that wins you one."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,Wish the original audio was in Italian. Would really hit home. Enzo speaking english is yikes‚Ä¶
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-04,"I thought the movie was surely &quot;Ferrari&quot; enough... Enzo, a legendary figure with a complex life as his muse.  I got lost in it... Time well spent"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,Hope its realistic.. so during the race Ferrari mess up the race strategy üòÇ
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-04-29,"Excellent movie by all involved.  The movie takes its time and is well worth it. Adam Driver&#39;s best performance.  Penelope Cruz is outstanding.  Michael Mann&#39;s direction and the cinematography is fantastic, puts you right in the time and place."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-24,"Looks great! Also, Penelope Cruz, forever"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,This is my Oppenheimer
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-21,If there‚Äôs a more aptly named actor for this movie I‚Äôd love to know.<br><br>Michael Mann and 2 Ferraris in the same space. Can‚Äôt wait.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,"Looks incredible, can‚Äôt wait to see it."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-27,"The lead male was wrongly cast and the CGI was, well, what can one say ?  A good effort to capture that timeframe. Cruz was mega."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-08,"As a truck driver, my friends and I can assure you, high performance cars, bikes and their riders will fly, and sometimes even hit traffic lights and trees mid flight when driven/ridden at speed."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-20,I really want 3 movies for Modern F1<br><br>Aiden Jackson: The Rise Of F2 Champion (GP2 2015-2016) (Prema Racing Aiden Felgate and Charles Leclerc)<br><br>‚ÄåAiden Jackson: The Rookie Of F1 (F1 2017-2018)<br>(Aiden Felgate and Sergio Perez Team up for Force India)  <br><br>‚ÄåAiden Jackson: The Rise of The Mercedes Champion (F1 2019-2021 War between Mercedes and Red Bull for the win) <br><br>(Aiden Felgate vs Max Verstappen(F1 Dutchman villain) and his teammate Lewis Hamilton)<br><br>Featuring: <br>Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) <br>Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) <br>Lando Norris (McLaren) <br>Sebastian Vettel (Alpine) <br><br>EA<br>SKY cinema<br>Paramount
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-29,Just watched this movie this afternoon and I loved it
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-26,"This got snubbed and it is truly sad it did but movies always prove their legacies with time. This movie rules, saw it last night. Stays with you for sure"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-04,Very exciting to watch. Worth every penny.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-05-18,"I watched the movie wonderful. some scenes missing , Penelope Cruz best acting there performance mind <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERIBTIlVVJQ&amp;t=147"">2:27</a> blowing."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-02,"A fantastic movie, and Driver and Cruz&#39;s performances were magnificent!"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-03-07,Good movie but brutal from all aspects. Didn&#39;t expect so many people to die.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-29,Adam Driver deserves an Oscar what an awesome performance
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-17,"That terrible CGI is 100% on brand for Ferrari. Glad to see the spirit of Enzo is alive: Lie, Obfuscate, Win at all costs."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-18,"Well, that last crash was a little too much. That&#39;s not F&amp;F ffs."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-03-07,This wasnt as good as i was expecting. There was no chemistry between the actors and they could of done a much better job telling the story of how it all started. Just my opinion but 5/10 max
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-20,Steve Coogan is amazing playing Adam Driver playing Enzo Ferrari.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-10,So cool that they got a real endurance racer to play Piero Taruffi!
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-11-06,"Ferrari was absolutely beautiful, phenomenal and a must watch film ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-11-20,"I was going to make a joke about the inevitable prequel to Ford vs. Ferrari, but I wasn&#39;t expecting Michael Mann."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,"CGI is really a joke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERIBTIlVVJQ&amp;t=120"">2:00</a>"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-19,That crash looks awful. What year is it?
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-12,Incredible Realistic Acting !
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-26,"Casting director - what&#39;s your name ?<br><br>Adam - I&#39;m driver , Adam driver <br><br>CD - congratulations !! You selected as a driver in a movie"
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-04-13,Bittersweet movie. Driver is excellent. Wow.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-10-24,"Looks great, Best sports car brand in the world. The Ferrari teams of the past twenty years would be dead if Enzo was around.üòä<br>Should be ashamed, tgen again, Ferrari is not just in F1, they win other competitions too, like Leads, GT and so on."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-04,Best part is at :55 where the dude has to explain to Ferrari how being broke works
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-23,Adam Driver finally getting to be a driver in a classic movieüòÅ
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-11-10,Nice. A movie called Ferrari with two actors named Driver and Cruz.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-14,Hoping it&#39;s on par with Rush. THAT was probably the best driving movie I&#39;ve seen.
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-08,"Anyone know the music that starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERIBTIlVVJQ&amp;t=51"">0:51</a>?"

Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-03-11,"I saw the movie last night, all the best moments are in this trailer, the rest is boring . It is really a cold film without emotion, and ironically it‚Äôs very slow, there are too many boring scenes with Ferrari‚Äôs wife and his mistress, I would have preferred the film to focus on competition."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-02-14,"Trailer is better than the movie, it&#39;s enough..."

Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-01-09,"Definitely excited to see this, but can‚Äôt get past the fact that it‚Äôs all in English when in real life, no way anyone was speaking English during these events in Italy.. obviously it‚Äôs for an American market but.. feels like it lacks a certain aspect of authenticity"

Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-03-20,"There&#39;s cinema production and then there&#39;s Penelope cinema. The only &quot;actor&quot; who can only do scenes sitting or standing still, the way actors were filmed in the 40s. Limited mark hitting and prop handling."
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-29,Oh wow! It&#39;s based on Brock Yates&#39; book- very niceüëç
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-06-29,Will this film be  on Bluray?
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-21,We were in Modena Italy when they were filming this. It was fun to be there and watch. Of course my wife loved seeing Patrick Dempsey.

Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2023-12-24,Mann re: Cruz‚Äì‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if she is channelling a certainty of judgment that‚Äôs coming from northern Italian tribes before Rome; it‚Äôs really primitive and strong.‚Äù What is it with directors and their ability to disappear totally up their own arse? SHE WAS JUST ACTING!
Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-02-27,"For those wondering, they must have fixed the crash because it did NOT look like that at all. It was actually pretty good."

Ferrari,ERIBTIlVVJQ,2024-05-06,the italians dont like the movie because adam driver and patrick dempsey play italians.  the movie takes place in 1957 and leads up the ferrari disaster of that year where 9 spectators were killed. and its also about his crazy wife

The Machine,AwDKLEaJxMk,2023-02-26,"I can&#39;t believe this story is actually gonna become a movie now, this is kind of awesome, I loved the whole story itself when he was just telling it"
The Machine,AwDKLEaJxMk,2023-02-28,I wonder if Mark Hamill even understands what he is to us. Just elevates everything
The Machine,AwDKLEaJxMk,2023-02-25,"I thought mark hamill was gonna be a minor role in this, I‚Äôm so glad that he‚Äôs gonna be in for the full ride"

The Machine,AwDKLEaJxMk,2023-02-25,"Is it just me or is anyone else shocked by Bert&#39;s acting!? Like he&#39;s actually very convincing, at least in this trailer."

The Machine,AwDKLEaJxMk,2023-02-23,"We&#39;ll probably never see Mark Hamill as a live-action Joker, but this is a close second."

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-04,"The actress seems perfect but I&#39;m very glad they are using Whitney&#39;s voice for the singing. Not only her voice CAN NOT be replicated, but I find it respectful as well. She was a true Legend. The VOICE!"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,Naomi has really nailed her speaking voice. It is only right they use Whitney&#39;s singing voice as nobody sounds like her.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-04,"&quot;I don&#39;t know how to sing black and I don&#39;t know how to sing white either, I know how to sing!&quot; There will never be anyone else close to her talent or beauty again she was definitely 1 in a Billion!!!"

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-16,"I&#39;m in tears just from hearing her sing &quot;Star Spangle Banner&quot;. Her voice was/is amazing.

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"Whitney will always touch our hearts, she is a true artist by the fullest definition of the word.  she&#39;s the only artist i&#39;d rather listen to lives and live performances than the studio songs themselves.  this is certification that she had a talent never seen before.  I just watched, literally now, the documentary about her - Called Whitney -, And I was thrilled with this tribute. What a gift.  I&#39;m 19 years old, and I ask the new ones who are watching this video, pass Whitney from generation to generation, to prove that not even death was able to end the life she had in her voice."

She deserves to be honored and respected, to be given her flowers for what she is to music. It looks soo good and i can only pray that it‚Äôs as good as it looks! üôèüèΩ"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,Sounds like Naomi Ackie nailed her speaking voice - can‚Äôt wait to watch this üòç
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"In honor of Whitney, I will see this performance. <br>Whitney was very animated too so I hope we see Naomi Ackie lightning up any room she walks in throughout this movie.<br>R.I.P. Whitney Houston üôèüèæüëë"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2023-01-15,"Whitney may be gone, but her voice and soul lives through us all."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-18,"Whitney Houston turned my existence<br>into a real human life<br>and gave me as much happiness as no one could give. RIP in piece, great singer! And thank you for movie!"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,I&#39;m so glad they&#39;re finally making a movie about Whitney Houston üôå
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"Heard the anthem part and damn literal chills,  not even a US citizen . That voice is just wow"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"Watching this, hearing her singing, it gives me chills. Whitney was a once in a lifetime voice who left us too soon."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-16,If the trailer alone gives you GOOSEBUMPS imagine the theatrical experience<br><br>WOW. Can&#39;t wait.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2023-06-29,"I get chills every time I watch this trailer‚Ä¶ this captures the magic, the voice, the pep and the entire essence of Whitney for those of us who grew up with her üíñ‚ú®!!! I will always see her as the princess I saw her as when I was 5. She was so special"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,I really need to listen to more of Whitney Huston. I Wanna Dance with Somebody and How Will I Know just put me in such a good mood every time I listen to them! This is going to be a really good movie
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,This looks so good. I teared up hearing that voice again. When she first came out in 1985 you instantly recognized she was one of the mega-stars
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"I saw an interview with her drummer. He said Whitney would always go for the jugular in every song. But, you never knew when it was coming. That was one secret to how amazing she was. Example, she could go high, or like in the anthem she aims for a lower alternate take on the &quot;braaaa-aaave&quot; at the end. She knew how to make it stun."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-05,I got goosebumps. She did the best Star Spangled Banner in human history. I play it every year during 4th of July. I miss her and her music. The trailer looks great. I hope the movie does her justice.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-10-10,"When you literally grew up with her music, it&#39;s even more meaningful. I&#39;m simply teary eyed and getting chills seeing this trailer. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-30,"Just got done watching this with my mom (she was alive during her era however I was born in 2000) so I only know her because of her song ‚Äú I wanna dance with somebody‚Äù but after watching her and only knowing her one song and how she died, I gotta say the movie was AMAZING. It felt like I was actually there with her the whole time. If you‚Äôre a younger generation like me I would suggest you watch this movie to get to know more of her."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"The best thing about this is - they have used her REAL voice. Her own voice. Unlike the Aretha Franklin biopic, where Jennifer Hudson sang her songs. <br><br>The experience of hearing THAT VOICE in theaters would be something else! üòçüòç"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,Didn&#39;t know they were going to release a movie like this!!  I may actually see this in the big screen!  Only cause I LOVE her music!  I wanna hear that REAL loud!!!!!
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,I‚Äôm so happy Whitney now has an actually biopic playing on the big screen the trailer it made me think of how much Whitney was such an iconic singer and known as the voice so iconic still gone way too soon
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-18,"In a documentary about the Buffalo Bills trips to the SB, many of the players state how the best part of the whole experience including the game itself was getting to watch her sing the National Anthem. Gives me goosebumps every time. IMO, the greatest singer over the last 50 years, possibly all time."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-21,This reminds me of just how much I miss you Whitney!
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"Say what you want but Naomi Ackie looks stellar as Whitney Houston. The fact that the trailer showed no drugs , let‚Äôs me know they focused on the right thing. HER VOICE, and it‚Äôs about damn time. Yes drugs will be shown because it was apart of her struggles but I‚Äôm glad that the main focus seems to be her voice, the tribute Whitney deserves. She was more then her demons!!! üëèüèæ<br><br>Update: To the responses of her not looking like Whitney , y‚Äôall can be mad all y‚Äôall want , Naomi won the role fair and square, she auditioned just like everybody else!! The role was not handed to her, she put in the work , and gave Whitney‚Äôs team what they were looking for, im almost 100% sure there was several girls that looked more like her during the audition process that took nearly a year but if Naomi gave the best performance then she was the right choice!!!!! She is an actress not a look alike impersonator. Y‚Äôall see a trailer and assume she isn‚Äôt the right choice y‚Äôall do this with damn near every biopic that comes out , and majority of the time the actors y‚Äôall bully for not looking like the person their playing honestly ends up being some of best performances! Recently Austin Butler as Elvis literally Austin didn‚Äôt look shit like Elvis but he nailed that part because his job was to act!!! So is Naomi‚Äôs!!!"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"I don‚Äôt know if this movie is going to be good or not, but I got goosebumps when she said ‚ÄúWhitney Elizabeth Houston‚Äù, it was like listening to Whitney."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-02,I was knee high to my mamma when this woman first graced us with her voice!  One Moment In Time was my sisters first dance solo.. Her vocals for the Star Spangled Banner STILL GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS.. Her remake of I Will Always Love You was my first üíî break-up üé∂ in Junior High..  Your ‚ù§Ô∏è Is My ‚ù§ is one of mine &amp; my husbands üéµ <br>The Woman Is An Icon <br>A ‚≠êÔ∏è Too Bright To Shine So Bright Here:( <br>RIP Whitney Houston <br>üïä üéô üéº
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2024-02-21,I can guarantee one thing from this movie: Spotify&#39;s top charts will be filled with Whitney Houston songs.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-21,The Greatest singer of all time! The voice! Been waiting for this movie. So thankful that there is one of those amazing things to look forward to this Decemeber.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,seeing her sing the national anthem brings back all those emotions when i seen her do it the first time.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"To this day, no one has had a rendition of the US national anthem like Whitney.......I repeat......NO ONE!!!!!!!!!"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"Love that the movie is being told through her discography, glad all era&#39;s are getting love including 2009 era. But I&#39;m most glad Whitney Houston sings to her own story with The Voice. ü•∫üò≠üéôÔ∏èüíúüïäÔ∏è Can&#39;t wait to see it, hope South Africa also gets a theatre release on the same day. ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-11-21,"When this played in the theatres - I got GOOSEBUMPS! I got butterflies, EVERYTHING. Im excited to watch this"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-21,Why is it that the brightest of stars burn out and fade away too early? This looks to be an amazing biopic of a very humble and talented young woman.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"You know something, looking at the trailer, I understand now why it was decided that &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot; was the more fitting title for the movie as opposed to &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, because Somebody was her career&#39;s biggest landmark, what made her the icon she continues to be today along with many of her incredible songs, but its &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot; that broke every barrier at her rise of stardom. I absolutely cannot wait to see Naomi Ackie shine greatly as Whitney!"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,The only one who can give me continuous goosebumps with her voice. I miss her :(

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-25,FOREVER THE VOICE. And NOBODY will ever take that title away from her. Nobody. I can&#39;t wait to watch this &lt;3
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-11-12,"Nippy was born the same year as me: 1963.   And yes,  she was the greatest voice of that/our generation.   I can&#39;t think of a possible exception."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"I grew up watching and admiring Whitney Houston!! Im so excited to see this rendition of her life,please be good!! Is what Whitney deserve üíìüíìüíì"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-25,"This was an amazing movie üçø, it was done with class and they gave WEH her flowers instead of just focusing on her trials and tribulations, trust they are in the movie but they highlighted her beautiful talent.  RIP."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-10-28,Only whitney can put tears in my eyes......shes just too much
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-21,"That Star Spangled Banner sequence has been shown in such a GRAND and EPIC scale, it would be an experience unlike any other biopic just to witness THAT on the big screen. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait üëèüëè"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-11,We sure miss her and her music!!!! RIP!!
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,She doesn‚Äôt look like Whitney at all but she definitely seems to have the mannerisms down and she also her speaking voice also sounds like Whitney. I‚Äôm excited to see this.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2023-04-29,I just saw the movie on Netflix and it was so beautiful. Whitney is truly ‚Äúthe VOICE‚Äù üò¢‚ù§
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-12-23,About time they dedicated a movie and a big screen strictly to Whitney Houston. I‚Äôve been obsessed with her my whole life. She‚Äôs an inspiration to me and I will be there opening day to see this. I just hope they portray the good that she accomplished and not the drugs and bad things.
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2023-04-25,"I choked the minute, she sang the song GREATEST LOVE OF ALL. <br>What a privelege to grow up during those years listening to Whitney. Today&#39;s generation will never understand what music really meant once upon a time. Lovely movie..."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2024-12-05,"Whitney Houston was truly an extraordinary legend. It is so sad that she left us so early. Too bad it happened this way. The movie about her life is beautifully made. Of course, I can imagine that not everything happened exactly as shown, but I believe a large part of it is true. She was one of the greatest singers of all time and more than deserved her success. She will always remain in my heart. Everyone goes through tough times in life. You can see that, for example, with Britney Spears. Many people dream of being a star because it seems so amazing and glamorous at first. But people often forget about the darker sides of being in the spotlight, like the loss of privacy and the immense pressure. I hope Whitney Houston rests in peace. Her music and legacy will remain unforgettable forever."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-18,"Really can&#39;t wait to see this ‚ù§ literally got goosebumps when I watched this trailer. Absolutely love Whitney and still miss her so much, hope your at peace now. One of my biggest musical Heroes x"

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,Wow I‚Äôm speechless &amp; just in Awe !!! This movie looks like it‚Äôs gonna be a joyous celebration of the life of Whitney Houston but also heartbreaking üíî as well.

It really felt like my most beloved singer on the earth came back in my sight, I couldn&#39;t hold my tears for 2 hours with the music sound and replicated image of her! I love you Whitney and I didn&#39;t know much about her life in the entertainment industry, its sad to know how the greatest musicians are often not only influenced by uncontrollable money and power but also been put under patriarchy exploitation. I appreciate more her life devoted to those songs she left, and producers who directed the movie üò≠"
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-15,"ok, I was wrong my first thought was how many movies are they going to make about Ms. Whitney, but after seeing this trailer I believe they finally got it right and it&#39;s what we needed. Can&#39;t wait to see it‚ù£"

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-09-19,"This gave me chills! I don&#39;t usually care about biopics, but this looks almost worth getting to the cinema again (haven&#39;t been since 2015).

Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2023-05-09,"Three things I liked about this Whitney film: (1) portrayal of Clive (2) Whitney&#39;s speaking voice (3) the Anthem scene. <br>As Naomi&#39;s acting per se was great, they could have just turned to a little bit of deep learning so that Naomi&#39;s face could resemble Whitney&#39;s face more."
Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,9tfemzaMkoU,2022-10-02,Absolutely love Whitney Houston‚ù§Ô∏èI‚Äôm here for this movie üé• üçø
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,Willem Dafoe has been in the &quot;why tf not?&quot; stage of his career for almost 30 years now and it&#39;s been fun to see
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-09,"All I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt think a movie like Everything Everywhere All At Once would have won so many awards or got so much attention 15 years ago. Is that so wrong? I know weird movies have always existed, I own most of them. But I didn‚Äôt know personally anyone else who liked them as much as me before. I‚Äôm happy about something. Sorry for offending everyone sheesh üôÑ"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,Willem Dafoe and Yorgos Lanthimos is one of those dream pairings that I&#39;m so glad we finally got.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-30,Yorgos always gives me this feeling of delightful melancholy
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-10,I‚Äôm surprised A24 didn‚Äôt get their hands on this project. It looks like they‚Äôre influencing the industry &amp; pushing other studios to break out of their comfort zone &amp; I love it! üòä
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,Emma Stone really said it‚Äôs time for a second Oscar!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"Wonderful trailer. We get a basic premise, a vibe, a sizzle of beautiful shots, and lots of questions to be answered. 100% going to be seeing this in theatres."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-31,"Great movie, Emma Stone gave an awesome performance, Mark Ruffalo was hilarious, and Dafoe, was Dafoe."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-24,I definitely felt a connection with Bella. I broke my entire body and was close to death in a car accident. I had a brain injury and had to relearn everything. I get emotional rewatching this because it makes me realize everything I can and should do to make myself happy.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-03,"If she won the Oscar for La La Land, which was so deserved, she‚Äôs 10000% winning her second one for this. What an outstanding performance!"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-09,"The cinematography, production design, costumes, makeup, hair, and visual effects are absolutely breathtaking. The art direction reminds me of the surreal kids paintings and movies I watched as a kid. It‚Äôs giving mirrormask vibes."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-07,finally we have a bjork biography. all is full of love!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"I love that they didn&#39;t overshare in the trailer. Just basic plot details, definitely looking forward to this one!!"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,Emma stone is winning her second Oscar. And this movie is winning cinematography for sure.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-26,"Just came back from the movie theater, absolutely in awe of this! This is one of the strangest, yet funniest movies I&#39;ve ever seen, but does deliver a lesson about freedom, empowerment, mindfulness, and self-discovery. An absolutely Oscar-worthy performance from Emma Stone, definitely her best role so far (at least in my own humble opinion)."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2025-02-03,"Great movie.. exceptional actors, hilarious situations and worthy of every award this has received, BAFTA, Golden Globe and Oscar.  One of the most creative movies in the past ten years!"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"Cinematography, design and costumes look incredible."

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-02-27,"Honestly some parts of this movie could be a great metaphor of how individuals with autism experience the world. The brutal honesty, not fitting in, wanting to, but not knowing how, The sensory overload, easily trusting. This movie resonated with me."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-06-22,"Forced my parents to watch this movie (60s living in Florida), my mom loved and laughed and watched the whole thing, dad fell asleep lol"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-12-04,"I‚Äôm absolutely loving that arthouse films are getting a much bigger budget and spotlight nowadays. I loooove quirky avant-garde films and stories like these. Like jet fuel for the senses and imagination. I‚Äôm all in for this gem! December 2023 is going to be HUGE for quite a few films! There‚Äôs so many to list, so little time to catch them all in theaters (not to mention my wallet given the holidays üòÇ)"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-30,One of the best films of all-time. Visually stunning. A cinematic masterpiece. Emma Stone gives an unforgettable performance as Bella Baxter. This is a can&#39;t miss movie.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-08,"I had no idea what was coming after i watched the trailer. The movie is fantastically the strangest. The perfect amount of unexpectedness, fever dream like aesthetic and nothing short of beautiful. Loved every second of it. Emma&#39;s brilliance shined through"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-02,"Here&#39;s my review, <br><br>So this movie makes me feel all sorts of emotions. It&#39;s like something I&#39;ve never really seen, can&#39;t really put it even in a category. So without giving the movie away I&#39;m gonna tell you what I took from this movie. <br><br>First, its about if someone had a fresh start how they would take on a different path. <br><br>Second it shows just how much men influence women by trying to manipulate, control and confine them. Treating a woman as property instead of a human being. You will not see all demonized in this, instead you will be able to recognize the good men from the bad ones. It shows both sides. <br><br>Thirdly it challenged even my own thinking and it made me realize how I have let men influence me. I do think for myself but I also believe I&#39;m too nice. üòä But this Bella Baxtor lady I love...... Her character. Emma Stone did exceptional in this <br><br>I guess the only negative I would say on it is there is no consequences for Bellas actions. She thinks on impulse alot and even when educating herself she chooses a path that is a little shocking. However in the end she seems to be able to redeem herself in alot of ways <br><br>The one thing I love so much is she never is sorry, she might be impulsive even cold hearted but she lets herself become open to new experiences. All without letting these things negatively affect her. <br><br>It&#39;s like she deflects alot she doesn&#39;t allow other people to define HER. Iove this. It&#39;s how I think I refuse to let others get the best of me. But even I can be negatively effected. But seeing this character I think gosh I love to be like this like so unapologetic and adventurious. It shows the double standard of how men are freely to do what they wish but when a woman does it everyone judges her, it shows how ridiculous that is and let&#39;s it land right on its head. It&#39;s a wacky movie but a good one I would watch again because it&#39;s also heartfelt."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-02-02,"This is the best movie I watched in a long time. Visually, sonically and story wise. Its such an orgasm for your brain/heart/soul. Such an original story, adapted in such a unique way. I wiuld even say, this is a new movie genre - tell me if I&#39;m wrong, but I have never seen or experienced a movie like this. <br><br>This is what makes people wanna go to the cinema. Its movies like this one, that make people wonder,  make them think and feel, longing for more. This should have the hype that &#39;Barbenheimer&#39; had. Also, Emma Stone is a revelation, sucking you in with her astonishing performance in such a complex, fun, yet surely difficult to execute acting role..  <br><br>I can only encourage everyone to go and watch this awesome film. You will not regret, if you&#39;re a cinephile like me. <br><br>This has to win best film and Emma Stone truly deserves that second Oscar. <br>So glad I got to see this movie. Magic was created."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-11,Willem Dafoe really had a meme line &quot;you know im kind of a romantic&quot;
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-18,"I did not realise they&#39;d released a trailer for this. Alasdair Gray is absolutely my favourite author, so to see that this adaptation seems to be doing his work justice is very heartening."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-06-30,I don&#39;t think that you can successfully label a genre to this film. It&#39;s freaking diverse! A masterpiece indeed. All heavyweight actors doing their best work. Stunning!<br><b>30 June 2024</b>
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-09,Wonderful trailer.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-12-29,"The genius of this film is unparalleled. The story of a woman becoming in all the graphic glory of an awakening of mind, body, and soul. The cinematography, scenery, costumes, and the sheer brilliance of the entire cast captivates, transports, and transcends. And the Oscar for best film goes to . . ."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,This feels like a Terry Gilliam film. It&#39;s either a hit or miss I will still watch it because Yorgos is directing it!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-28,"I know for a facts movie of this kind already existed in the 70s or so, it‚Äôs unique and weird, people love it. And this kind or artistic/genre will be popular for a while but the hype will go down again quite soon surely and will be popular again in 20-30 or even more years."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-12-18,"This was the best movie I‚Äôve seen in years. A total freak show but the costumes, set, dialogue and acting were off the charts good. Not for the faint of heart."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-17,emma stone is completely out acting every single person in this trailer and she‚Äôs doing it so effortlessly. her performance is gonna be insane and will likely earn her oscar number 2.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-12-23,This movie was so bizarre yet beautiful at the same time. It felt like a fever dream. Need to watch it again.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-05,a film as magnificent as this one is never to be missed.üçø

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"I have to admit, I don&#39;t find Yorgos&#39; films to be for me, but I absolutely cannot deny that he is truly visionary in every sense of the word, and that is something I have to support."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-11-02,"the Perfect word for this movie is: ‚ú®FASCINATING‚ú®.<br>the cast.

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,I am living and dying for the aesthetic of this movie. It&#39;s giving me very specific vibes like the way they depicted heaven on what dreams may come. Or the smashing pumpkins tonight tonight video.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,The Favourite was a masterpiece. Emma is clearly brilliant. AGAIN. and seeing Jarrod makes me VERY happy. I can&#39;t wait for this one.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2025-03-05,The music of this entire film is pure absolute genius. I love it so much!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-12-22,"This was the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen , subtle dark humor. Beautifully weird  but really fun . Definitely not for kids lots of nudity and some grotesque imagery. 10/10 movie great job creating this masterpiece"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-02-28,Yorgos always gives me this feeling of delightful melancholy and almost nightmarish unease... he&#39;s like mother goose on acid.

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-02-11,"Seeing the trailer i knew it was going to be a great film, but i was not expecting to love it as much as i do now. Bella is definitely one of my favorite fictional characters of all time."

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-23,This is masterpiece. Emma has to win all the awards for this extraordinary performance
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-31,"So...........is everyone just glossing over the fact that she had the literal mind of a child/preteen and the director thought it was ok to have people having sex with her?  Even if the characters didn&#39;t know the whole story, it was akin to having sex with a mentally slow patient."

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-05-23,Just watched this movie on my flight from London &amp; Omg it‚Äôs sooo amazing!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-18,"Congratulations, Emma Stone for winning the best lead actress at the Oscars!"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"We have Emma Stone being silly, that‚Äôs the most important thing."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-09,"This makes me want to see a Lanthimos/Del Toro collaboration, I think it would be so magical!"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-05,"It&#39;s a very beautiful film, and it makes one happy that such films are awards."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-03-02,"Skeetor forever! Love Emma Stone and her acting. This movie was so well done in every element! Acting, cinematography, pace, music, script and then the over arching message that a women‚Äôs freedom is such a threat to the male ego and that her power is in her anatomy!! Her options!‚Äô!! I thoroughly enjoyed this film"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,It looks weird as hell and the cast is great! I&#39;ll definitely be seeing this
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-09,I am so unbelievably excited for this movie. They just don‚Äôt make films like this very often anymore! üñ§ can‚Äôt wait!
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-06-08,"&quot;Poor Things&quot; is a film that really defies logic and common sense. Not only does it underestimate the intelligence of viewers, it also promotes a disturbing and morally questionable agenda. The most shocking thing is that Emma Stone, with a performance that borders on exaggeration, won an Oscar for her role. It&#39;s difficult to understand how the Academy considered a performance in which she spends most of her time acting childish and participating in explicit scenes to be award-winning.<br><br>The film&#39;s premise is extremely problematic, treating serious themes like pedophilia with a sickly lightness, almost as if it were something normal just to shock the audience. It is disgusting and irresponsible to approach such a sensitive topic in this way.<br><br>Furthermore, the film seems to advocate socialism, trying to sell an outdated and destructive idea as if it were something glamorous. The attempt to romanticize a system that has historically brought so much suffering and oppression is not only insulting, but also dangerously ignorant.<br><br>Another revolting point is the glorification of prostitution. The film portrays prostitution as an empowering choice, ignoring the harsh and cruel realities faced by many people around the world. This distorted view is an affront to reality.<br><br>And Emma Stone... her performance is embarrassing. Seeing an award-winning actress for behaving in a childish manner and participating in explicit scenes is an experience that challenges any notion of artistic merit. How can such a disastrous performance win an Oscar? It seems that the Academy has completely lost its way.<br><br>&quot;Poor Things&quot; is a film that deserves to be forgotten. It&#39;s a stain on the film industry, reminding us of how far cinema can descend. If you value your dignity and morality, stay away from this film. It&#39;s a clear example of everything that&#39;s wrong in the entertainment world today."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-10,I think Stones performance is going to be outstanding + mindblowing. Mark my words.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-02,This is one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. I haven‚Äôt been moved like this in a long time.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-02-04,"Just seen this, and all I can say is<br><br>Wow!<br><br>10/10<br><br>Poor Things is for 2024, what Sweet Movie by Du≈°an Makavejev was in 1974!<br><br>Both films are reflections of life, from an eye who always been looking at it another way."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-04-03,"Thank you SOOOOO MUCH for this wonderful movie!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I enjoy every bit of it, it was a mesmerizing experience‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"

Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-09,"Last night, Emma Stone beating Margot Robbie at the Golden Globes at Best Actress category. That means that Emma Stone‚Äôs looking for another Oscar. Spoiler Alert. This movie is gonna have more Oscars Nominations this year than Oppenheimer and Barbie."
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,I can already tell you this is movie of the year. Nothing looks wrong. Nothing looks stupid. Very well done.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-09-02,Willem Dafoe rage can be so extreme at times when he gets pushed to far at times ‚ù§
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2024-01-27,"Just got home from watching this movie and I loved it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs funny, sad, heartwarming and loads of fun. I hope the Academy does the right thing and allows the presenter of the Best Actress award to say Emma Stones name. Her performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserves to take home an Oscar"
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,Yorgos Lanthimos is a genius and i can&#39;t wait for this movie
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-18,Few things: <br>1. I love the fact that Emma Stone full on tackled Willem Dafoe at the start of the trailer. <br>2. The Duck/Dog animals are nightmare fuels.<br>3. LOVE the use of color in this trailer.<br>4. Is Mark Ruffalo doing a weird Marlon Brando ‚ÄúSTELLA!!!‚Äù Thing at the end? <br>5. I think Ramy Youssef is gonna be a surprise and the  breakout from this movie.
Poor Things,RlbR5N6veqw,2023-06-08,"love the reference with A Streetcar Named Desire, looks absolutely weird and i love it,and it sure will be at least nominated for Cinematography, Visual Efects and Costume Design and probably many others!!!"

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-11,"The amount of people in the comments who weren&#39;t paying attention is crazy. &quot;So is the arc gonna be a movie or a season?&quot; It literally says what it is in the trailer. It&#39;s a theatrical event where the last two episodes of season 2 and the first episode of season 3 are being screened before s3 starts airing. And if you&#39;re still confused somehow, check <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43NGiNYIS6E&amp;t=64"">1:04</a>."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-24,"Demon Slayer is so good that it set new precedents for how anime can release. It is a seminal work outside of its own story, and that&#39;s kind&#39;ve incredible. I&#39;m interested to see if this does as well as Demon Train, considering 2/3&#39;s of its content will be stuff we&#39;ve seen before."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-17,The animation just keeps getting better! I wonder how swordsmith village arc will be!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-10,I sure do love that it leaves theaters right as Spring Break begins for college
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-10,So basically this &quot;movie&quot; is going to be two-thirds a retelling of the last couple of episodes of the Entertainment District arc and the last third is going to be episode one of the Swordsmith Village arc?
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-03-05,this ‚Äúmovie‚Äù should‚Äôve been a full on sword smith village arc adaptation. I want my money back deadassüíÄ
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-03-05,"The movie was not worth it, I honestly thought there would be more of the Swordsmith Village arc"

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-03-06,** HEADS-UP **<br><br>Don‚Äôt expect an actual movie. It is literally the last two anime episodes of season 2 and the first episode of season 3 spliced awkwardly and amateurly together. There is nothing special about it. No extra or extended scenes for mover goers. You would get the exact same experience for far less just waiting a couple more months for season 3 to begin airing. I saw it in theaters this past Friday at 7pm. Was a bit disappointed. It‚Äôs a blatant cash grab.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-02-10,Bouta pull up in my Haori. Let&#39;s make this a new trend to wear a Haori to this movie just as people wore suits to the Minions movie

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-03-04,"Okay, for all the people saying that &quot;This is a scam and/or a waste of time.&quot; Please know that this very trailer, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43NGiNYIS6E&amp;t=64"">1:04</a>, it tells you what the movie is gonna be. So it&#39;s not a scam, you&#39;re getting what you paid for. Now, there&#39;s valid criticism in why not make a movie with just season 3 stuff or poorly edited between episodes. But in all honestly, so what? This is meant to build up hype for the new upcoming season. This can also be done by recapping the last 2 episodes of season 2 for those who want to see it plus getting a look at season 3 with episode 1. All in all, you can simply watch just to support the hardworking animators that give us beautifully animated anime so that they can keep making this series look the way it does. So don&#39;t blame them for &quot;Wasting your time and money&quot; you can only blame yourself for not being able to read apparently"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village,43NGiNYIS6E,2023-03-11,"Don‚Äôt waste $$ to go see this In theaters you‚Äôll only see like 15 minutes top, just one big recap of everything happened .

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-12-31,The original house party had that magic because it reminded a lot of us what it was like to go to a house party in high school.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-18,"The fact they are shoving sooooo many celebrities in this, it&#39;s going to be a so/so movie"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-16,"While I&#39;m glad they have Kid N Play in a cameo, did we really need to reboot &quot;House Party&quot;???!!!! Let things stay classics Hollywood."
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,If Full Force don‚Äôt make a cameo I ain‚Äôt with it üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-11,"The potential is actually there, they didn&#39;t need to call it House Party though, they could have just called it &quot;Party At Bron&#39;s&quot; üíØüíØ"

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,Leave the classics alone!!!! This looks like a straight for TV movie. There are so many stories to tell so enough with the remakes and reboots.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-28,This has early 2000s energy and they need to make more movies like this
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-12-21,"Outside of a house party and a cameo of Kid N Play, this shouldn&#39;t have the name attached to it. There&#39;s a reason why the 4th movie went straight to basic cable and the 5th movie (including a cameo from Kid N Play), went straight to DVD. If it ain&#39;t broke, DON&#39;T FIX IT. I actually LOVED the first 3 House Party movies!"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-07,They made sure they sneak in all the cameos  to try to convince the audience üòÇüòÇ
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,Why does this look like it came straight from the early 2000&#39;s

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2025-01-20,"8.25 / 10 üçø <br>Better than alot of high budget movies , without doing too much üçø"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,In a time full of non stop superhero movies and endless remakes‚Ä¶ this actually looks pretty good
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-16,"The comments hating. Thank you for making a movie for us. Chill, funny, &amp; hallmarking the celebrities of our culture!"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-15,"It‚Äôs giving Netflix, str8 to streaming‚Ä¶ idk if I can sit thru this in theaters but imma check it out!"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-17,‚ÄúYour hairline is perfect. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous‚Äù<br><br>Lmao ain‚Äôt nobody jealous of that beijing sprayed on Bron‚Äôs craniumüòÇüòÇüòÇ
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-12-20,"Actually looks pretty watchable, can&#39;t top the original, but looks leagues better then all the sequels."

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-11-02,"‚ÄúNaaaa, that‚Äôs cap‚Äù LMAO üò≠"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-10,"they didnt have to reuse the name house party, the original was a classic"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-12-26,Nothing like the original House Party!!
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-21,Coming from a era where I loved the original and HP2 I dont know how I feel about this.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-31,The original house party with kid n play are the best
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-16,Another classic movie that should have not been remade

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-16,"Should go straight the streaming! The YouTube views is a clear indication that this film won‚Äôt make any money in theaters, send it to HBO Max and stop wasting our time!"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-14,Thanks queen James for another movie we didn‚Äôt ask for
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-15,Let&#39;s erase the last 2 House Parties and name this one HP4. I&#39;m definitely feeling the cast the trailer and got some laughs out of it
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-16,Best part is the LJ hologram and seeing Kid N Play.  It‚Äôs always I need to make this money to save my family. First one kept it simple.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,So let me get this straight AD can‚Äôt stay healthy enough to be on the court but he healthy enough to be out here making movies üòÇ

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-23,This should of been called &quot;INSTAGRAM PARTY&quot;
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-19,This is looks like it&#39;s from 2002 to 2007. I kinda love it.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,"The lighting is very good. These days lighting in movies, especially the interiors I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s overlit. It looks good like in the 90s and 80s. It is necessary to give a sense of calm in a chaotic movie and it is of utmost necessity in peaceful movies like Days of Heaven or Manchester by the Sea etc. In today&#39;s films, people use unnatural filters in movies and it sucks to see the world unnaturally with the lens of fake apocalyptic filters."
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-19,"I just realized something pretty cool. With this film, House Party is officially the second longest running film franchise with Black leads after Shaft. And neither one has been remade, just more sequels. Though I don‚Äôt like how the newer movies are sharing the exact same titles as their first movies. <br>‚Ä¢ House Party (1990) and House Party (2022)<br>‚Ä¢ Shaft (1971), and Shaft (2000), and‚Ä¶Shaft (2019)"
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-05,The original House Party was a cult classic imo. A great movie for it&#39;s era. Nobody asked for another remake.

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2023-01-13,"Just now finding out about this movie and its actually wasn&#39;t a bad idea.  All of the original House party movies will forever be our 90s classic flicks but just in that particular time. Baby it&#39;s 2023 and it&#39;s ok to discover up and coming fresh actors or atleast actors that we all know, that don&#39;t act in many flims but still are a great edition. House party 2023 gone be a classic for this generation."

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-15,"Sometimes, the thing you think you need, you really just want, and have no need for it.  This movie is a prime example of that. We all  want a House Party movie, we just don&#39;t need this one."

House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,Let me start by saying the original will NEVER be topped! With that being said this looks low key funny.
House Party,VO_xuS4FDHs,2022-10-14,I rolled my eyes when I saw the title. This looks genuinely funny. It&#39;s not too late to workshop the name to something more original like &quot;Big Daddy&#39;s House&quot; or &quot;Love James.&quot;

Radical,L4DvL0UBZPQ,2024-05-26,"A great film about how the educational system is often stagnated by the structural norms that are supposed to help kids learn. Unfortunately, as this film poignantly points out, the current educational structure is outdated &amp; often counter productive. My sister-in-law is a High School teacher here in the U.S. and we&#39;ve had discussions on how even SHE sees that the current educational process is not helping kids learn at the pace of a quickly changing world.  We need a major mind shift to re-structure how kids are taught."

Radical,L4DvL0UBZPQ,2024-02-04,This movie reminds me of 1988&#39;s &quot;stand and deliver&quot;...the stories are very similar.

Radical,L4DvL0UBZPQ,2023-10-23,Espero y que Eugenio les ahiga pagado a Los actores o que sea gratis su pelicula
Radical,L4DvL0UBZPQ,2024-01-27,"It annoys me that I can&#39;t seem to enjoy this kind of movie any more. I used to like kind of slow character based movies, even ones where I had to read the subtitles but I just got bored stiff about a third of the way though this one. I&#39;m sure my attention span has gotten shorter because of social media and the need for instant gratification. I can see the parts of the movie in the trailer here and honestly there&#39;s more emotion in the trailer by the way it&#39;s edited. I&#39;m sure the ending is emotional but I just can&#39;t get there."

Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"Just glad Joel Kinnaman is geting more action roles, after Altered Carbon I really wish we would see more of him, always been a heavily underrated actor for me personally."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,A film John Woo has always wanted to make. Completely dialogue-free.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,It&#39;s nice to see the Christmas action genre make a comeback.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-03-09,The movie has touched me in a way only a father can understand. This man died along with his son when they took him away from them. I cried when Brian was on the floor watching all those memories and things about his dear son. The  toy  train and those heartbreaking words  in the letter he left next to the grave for his wife cracked my heart in two. A great recommended movie.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"I can really feel the Christmas spirit here. The way he spreads all that joy, hope and love with everyone he meets. I know this will be a wonderful Christmas movie I can watch with all my family members, especially our children. They love the color red on christmas."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman IS a action movie star, glad to see him in this type a role again. dude needs more of these. he just looks like a badass"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman is amazing and I&#39;ve been a huge fan ever since Altered Carbon. I will watch anything this guy does, I think he&#39;s great. This looks like loads of fun and I can&#39;t wait for it to release."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-10-08,"Just glad Joel Kinnaman is getting more action roles, after Altered Carbon I really wish we would see more of him, always been a heavily underrated actor for me personally.

Completely dialogue-free."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,I&#39;m so happy to see Joel Kinnaman finally getting the recognition he deserves. What an underrated actor that is extraordinary in every role he commits to. A revenge filled action hero is the style that suits him and I&#39;m so glad to see him finally cementing his footing on the big screen with more movies! I&#39;ve been such a huge fan of his career since the Killing and RoboCop and it makes me so happy to see him in a film like this. I can&#39;t wait.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-05,"Looks like a nice Christmas movie, something the whole family can sit down with and enjoy."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-08,"An action movie with no dialogue. As a HoH (hard of hearing) action fan, this is music to my eyes! No lip reading, no staring at subtitles. Just pure balls to the wall action. No thinking required!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-01-01,I don‚Äôt give a shit about what people say; this was one of the better films of the year.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Joel Kinnaman is an amazing actor, criminally underutilized. And to see Kid Cudi involved in this brings me much joy. I have high hopes for this movie!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-07,The guy who edited this trailer deserves a raise. You guys did more than convince me to give this movie a chance.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Never in my life would I think a new John Woo movie would come out in 2023, but here we are. Could be interesting. Better have tons of slow-mo and doves."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-12-05,This movie made me tear up when he laid in his son&#39;s bed and imagined him laying with him it was rough to watch as a father. This movie is one of my favorites no doubt. <br>Avenged üíØ
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Who else just had their Christmas wish come true? Joel Kinneman finally gets to be totally badass again, thank you John Woo :-)"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-06,Absolutely love Joel Kinnaman and so glad he‚Äôs getting more action roles. And it‚Äôs Christmas action too. This looks really good!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,So excited for John Woo‚Äôs Hollywood comeback story. Even when he‚Äôs working with b-tier scripts the man knows how to make a godlike action movie.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-01-10,"FUCK THE CRITICS. Screw everyone who says ANYTHING bad about the movie. I just finished watching it. It kept me on the edge of my seat! I mean, no ones perfect, there me be flaws or imperfections here and there BUT not for me OR at least that&#39;s NOT what im here to say.<br>This movie, is AS REALISTIC...as it could get in terms of a father. The emotion...the fear, the rage...the confusion. This movie showed the protagonist as close to being one of us. Im 32, father of 2, a boy of 9 and a daughter of 8. I could literally imagine myself being there and...i got no words. AWESOME MOVIE 9.9/10 for me. Not gonna say anything more to avoid spoilers. Just go and watch it!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-11-03,Can&#39;t wipe the smile off of my face. John Woo is back in the west with Joel Kinnaman by his side. What a wonderful Christmas present to receive!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"I can feel the wide shots, one shot takes and well executed and choreographed action scenes coming through my screen as I watch this trailerüôè"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"Speechless Joel Kinnaman with John Wick moves, especially the last gunshots is what interested me more than some cheesy Christmas action violent night. Its great to see Joel Kinnaman in action again! 4.10.2023"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-02-28,"WoW!!!!  I mean just WOW......what a movie.  Kind of a sad story but very well put together and thought out.  Another excellent action movie for the Christmas season, right up there with all us Die Hard fans."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,Any new John Woo movie is a cause for celebration
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,John Woo hasn&#39;t done a hard core action movie in years!  This is going to be spectacular!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-10,SO EXCITED FOR JOHN WOO&#39;S RETURN. The best action director of our lifetime. You can always count on John Woo.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-01-03,"9/10 I totally recommend !! If you enjoy movies like : Taken, John Wick, The Equalizer...you&#39;re good to go ! (There&#39;s no dialogues, so no need to stay so focus trying to understand what the characters are saying, nor the expositions)"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-11-16,"As kids we had Home Alone, now we can cherish Christmas with the new generation of magic family movies like Violent Night, Silent Night and upcoming Terrifier 3. What a wonderful time to live in."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-06,"For those interested in Kinnaman:<br>Before Joel Kinnaman became a Hollywood star he starred in a Swedish Cop/Gangster movie series called Johan Falk (GSI), as the incredibly charming and likable Frank Wagner. The movies are in Swedish, but you can probably find them with English subtitles. They are really good, and Joel Kinnaman really carries the series."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"I don&#39;t know why, but this movie has me not only feeling giddy for a new John Woo film, but also feeling oddly glad. Our area had a number of gang-related freeway shootings that ending up leaving innocent children injured and/or dead. I feel that this movie is not only a great, kick-ass movie by John Woo, it&#39;s also a cathartic revenge fantasy for those who feel some lasting trauma from those real-life events. RIP Jasper Wu and Eliyanah. Wish the people who killed these poor babies could suffer this same fate."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-31,I have to say this movie was a very pleasant surprise. The acting with no dialogue was phenomenal. The action was stop notch. Great ride of a movie.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-11-27,"I&#39;m all for Joel Kinnaman. Whether this is a hit or miss, he&#39;s bred for this."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,I&#39;m definitely going to see this!!!<br>Joel Kinnaman is one of my favorite and highly underrated action stars.....I loved him in Robocop and Altered Carbon.<br>This looks like action start to finish.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-05,I can really appreciate that the trailer seems to suggest that great deal of training and planning were required before old buddy could get his revenge. It‚Äôs refreshing compared to the trope that being angry is enough for a regular person to get revenge on criminal organizations.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2025-03-31,"Just watched Joel Kinnaman in The Killing. One of the best pieces of TV ever made. Thrilling, and superb acting from all the cast. Catch it if you can, you won&#39;t be sorry."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"If it&#39;s directed by John Woo, it&#39;s gonna be awesome"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,Yay!!!  Nothing beats a good old holiday action flick!!!  It&#39;s a Die Hard tradition at this point.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"John Woo&#39;s The Killer Broken Arrow, Face Off &amp; Hard Target are absolute Action classics. Hope he strikes back with Silent Night üíØü§òüèª"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-03-01,"It was a good entertaining John Woo movie.I did not expect another The Killer,Hard Boiled,A Better Tomorrow or Face Off."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-05,"As a John Woo fan, I‚Äôm DEFINITELY watching this."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"2023 so far has been an action film lovers wet dream, we‚Äôve had John Wick 4, Sisu, Extraction 2, Equalizer 3, and now John Woo‚Äôs return with Silent Night. It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cryü•π"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,I&#39;ve loved Joel Kinnaman since Altered Carbon on Netflix. The guy is a beast and a hell of an actor.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-09-25,honestly went into the movie knowing nothing about it except that it involved Christmas and action. It really surprised me to find out that very rarely were there any words spoken in the movie. But it ended up being super cool for a short movie!!‚ù§
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,Absolutely loved Joel as the lead in the RoboCop reboot. Hopefully this next shot as a lead goes well for him.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"John Woo, a great comeback. He&#39;s the one who started all the stylish slow motion actions scenes and bullet times. Where was he all this time?"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,Joel Kinnaman is one of the most underrated actors out there. This looks fantastic. I love it.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-08-03,Trailer making masterclass!!! And the film lived up the hype this generated‚Ä¶ Bravo üëè
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-08,Remember meeting Joel in my town back when he still lived in Sweden he was recording the Swedish movies Johan Falk witch from he become famous and than moved to the states. Nice to see him getting more roles. We chatted for a bit and also we toke a picture together i remember.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,This movie is already a masterpiece
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-11-17,Nothing like a John Woo movie to get in the Christmas spirit üòä. In all honesty I‚Äôm always happy to see the legendary director‚Äôs movies.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-12-07,One of the best trailers ive seen in a long time!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-06,"I don&#39;t know if the movie will be good or not, but I am glad John woo still doing movies...He still has cool ideas for action sequences!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Wow this looks incredible, Face/Off is one of my favorite action movies ever. Can&#39;t wait to watch this one. Let&#39;s see the Doves Fly."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"Wow, this movie looks so awesome. It‚Äôs like a cross between John Wick meets diehard. I can‚Äôt wait to see it. Looks like a bloody good time. Really glad and happy to see John Woo back doing American movies again and he‚Äôs back with a vengeance. Very much looking forward to seeing this in theaters."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-03-04,"I swear this movie is underrated... i dunno why people hated this movie.. imdb only got 5.3, the movie got fresh action style , the plot is standard but the acting is Very good and well done.."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-07,"It&#39;s impressive that even given his age John Woo still has some ingredients to add to his film career, this film shows that even after twenty years he&#39;s still in shape, it was one of the most fun films I&#39;ve seen in recent years ‚ù§"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,Finally after 20 years.<br>John Woo returns to Hollywood.<br>‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,I AM DEFINITELY IN FOR THIS!!! The underrated Joel Kinnaman and the absolute legend John Woo!!! Wow!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-04-12,this movies was crazy üî•üî•üî•
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-30,So happy to see Joel getting more kick ass roles like this. He‚Äôs twice as good as some of those getting twice the work. I‚Äôll be seeing this for sure üëä
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,Nothing speaks &quot;peace on earth and good will toward men&quot; like an action flick during the most wonderful time of the year.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-23,No dialogue no talking no speech before the last killing..just pure action...love it...who else wants to see him as the next punisher
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-04-16,Ok so I love it. Big die hard energy. Actually would be up for a franchise revival love Willis but still would love a new version of die hard.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,There aren&#39;t enough Christmas movies out there. This looks pretty good!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Fan of John Woo, since &quot;A better tomorrow&quot; &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; &quot;The Killer&quot; era...i won&#39;t miss this..."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,We&#39;ve been long overdue for another american woo film. Cannot wait!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-09-21,Domt care what anyone says about this movie this movie was badass
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,John woo created Gun Fu and the John Wick movies are inspired by John Woo. This movie could be the best and the smartest action movie of the 21st century.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-08,"I have loved Joel Kinnaman impactful performances since streaming his series, &quot;The Killing&quot; years ago. This looks like a winner from the amazing action director John Woo.üòÉ"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-11-19,"This is one of those trailers where I stop halfway and say &quot;no more, I&#39;m sold&quot;."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-01-19,"Best movie i have seen in years!!!  I would do the same for my son if i had to. This movie proves that you dont need a movie with dialog, just a good story and good action. Also joel kinnen is an awesome actor."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-05,I will watch Joel Kinnaman in anything he&#39;s in.  So hyped for this.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-14,"SUPPORT THIS MOVIE, LET JOHN WOO KNOW WE LOVE AND APPRECIATE WHAT HE&#39;S DONE FOR ACTION MOVIES."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-09,"A movie without dialogue and full of action, I think this should be a separate genre. We would love more of this. ‚ù§"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-06-27,I am all for John Woo&#39;s film. Brilliant cinematic experience.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,looks like a fun low to mid budget movie from the master John Woo himself. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-06,"Ever since his role in House of Cards I absolutely admired his acting. For All Mankind and Altered Carbon were amazing as well, I‚Äòll def see this one too!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,It looks like we have the answer to the question- What if John Woo directed a Punisher movie?  Bring It!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-02-16,"Hi√ßbir film bu kadar i√ß a√ßƒ±cƒ±, y√ºrek par√ßalayƒ±cƒ± ve deh≈üet verici olmamƒ±≈ütƒ±."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,Bring back the good ole action movies... üî•
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-15,This looks absolutely ridiculous‚Ä¶ I am so going to love this movie!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-11,I know people who would STAND UP AND APPLAUD in the theater seeing this trailer. &quot;JOHN WOO&#39;S BACK??!! NO WAY!!&quot; It sure looks interesting. I hope it&#39;s one of the greatest movies ever made.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-02-12,"John Woo, YES! Just 10 minutes in and I was like no dialogue, this is gonna suck. Wrong!!! Glad I didn&#39;t bail on it, because it never bailed on me."
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-08,"&quot;They took away his voice. Now, he lets his guns do the talking.&quot;<br><br><br>I LOVE a good vigilante film!!!"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,I&#39;ve missed you John Woo!!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,The Woo is back. The master of action.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-07-04,This is one of my most favorite movies ever!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-16,Finally! Woo back in business!!! Doing what he does best: forcing the action genre to new heights!üçøüçª
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Looks so good, very excited for it"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,"Damn, i love Joel Kinnaman, especially since the first awesome season of altered carbon. He looks so badass in action scenes. I am freaking hyped for this movie<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx""></a>"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-01-03,This is one of the best movies in 2023 alongside Sisu. No talking it&#39;s just action
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-03,"Heck yes! Now can we get a movie with Keanu Reeves, Bob Odenkirk and Joel Kinnaman?"
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-05,I felt every line of praise for John Woo.
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-04,I love when trailers show you the whole movie before you see it doesn&#39;t leave any surprises out
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2024-03-18,ƒ∞t‚Äôs nice to see the Christmas action genre make a comeback
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-01,John Woo&#39;s version of a Silent Movie. No dialogue in the entire movie!!! WOW

Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-10-06,John Woo is the best action director ever! So excited for his new film!
Silent Night,yBnTqn0lBDA,2023-12-26,America needs this kind of heroes given the crime rate from gangs
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-02-22,I absolutely love when a movie trailer grabs my attention but doesn&#39;t tell me a single thing about the plot of the movie. 10/10
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,"A24 = original stories. Not remakes, sequels or recycled stories. They are bold. Even on their worst day I much rather watch one of their authentic new stories fail than to rehear/watch an altered recycled original. They are a fresh breath of air to cinema."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Ari Aster and Joaquin Phoenix sounded like a match made in heaven when Beau Is Afraid was first announced, now this looks like it will be one of the most bizarre, introspective, and comedically terrifying films in recent years and I couldn&#39;t be happier to welcome it with open arms."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-07-06,"Watched this at the movies last night. Epic. Hectic.<br>My closest friend had life long mental health issues, and had the same underlying soft loving nature as Beau in this movie. <br>I asked him once what it felt like to endure a psychotic episode, and he said  that you absolutely can not distinguish the difference between a thought and something happening in real life. <br>A couple of years ago, we went surfing together, I dropped him home afterwards and made plans to surf again the next day. But he woke up, took his board to the beach and walked up to the edge of a 100ft cliff and jumped off, beautiful sunny morning at 9am. <br>The weight of what he carried around (and hid beautifully from most of the world) in the background of his mind was a war that was eventually to much to bare. <br>There was so many moments in this film that reminded me of moments in time that I‚Äôd seen him travel through. <br>Amazing movie that blurred the lines between the reality he encompassed and the torture of his anxieties."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You‚Äôre not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire movie, but it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe. Such a good trailer!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,Finally an Aster movie where his twisted sense of humor is a top priority. Love it
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,"I love how these trailers barely tell anything about what happens, so nothing is spoiled, but also show everything at once about the movie"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-22,"I saw Beau is afraid yesterday, honestly I don&#39;t regret the 3 hours I spent watching this, one thing is  certain whether like it or not, you will never forget this movie."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,There is NOTHING I enjoy more on this planet than creative and weird movies. This is beautiful.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,You know a movie will be good when the preview does not spoil and leaves you wanting to discover what Beau is afraid of. Bravo
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-03-17,I love when a good director gets popular enough that they&#39;re allowed to be weird.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-05-18,"There are a lot of controversial opinions about this movie. It‚Äôs more metaphorical, it represents how to live with anxiety, basically a nightmare of a person with severe anxiety in absurd, black comedic portrayal. <br><br>It‚Äôs also about relationships in your life and their importance ( parents, partners etc) and how parents can control you even as an adult, how they planted deep fears into us only to be hindered from reaching our full potential and joy. What it‚Äôs like not finding your place in society and feeling like an outcast, not fitting anywhere, but even if you have a chance to live a happy life and find your people, your inner fears, your traumas will come get you and draw you back to the source of every bad thing in your life, mind until you can‚Äôt escape and there‚Äôs no where to go.<br><br>It‚Äôs about traumas, fears, anxiety and how they can decrease someone‚Äôs quality of life, determine their present and future and how you can be the prisoner of your own mind due to them."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,A24 is easily in the top 3 production companies right now. Even their work that isn&#39;t as popularly recognized is all of a really high standard and most have their own cult followings. I always get a feeling like I&#39;m in a fever dream watching A24 movies and it&#39;s rare that production companies can achieve that effect where you are enveloped in the story time after time üôè
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,God bless Ari Aster!
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Thanks Ari Aster for keeping the art of cinema alive and thanks Joaquin Phoenix for sculpting these characters with your unique talent. All the waiting has been worth it, this movie looks mind blowing."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-08-15,It&#39;s the kind of movie that makes you think for days afterwards. Absolutely brilliant movie
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,Joaquin Phoenix is one of those rare actors who whenever I see that he&#39;s involved in a project I have to watch it. Such a tremendously gifted actor.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"This could be a new example of ‚Äúpsychological horror ‚Äú we need  more filmmakers like Ari , we need people that push the limits of a preexisting art to something new ‚ù§"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,This is what I want to see above all else when it comes to movies. Something from a filmmaker who has a vision and wants to slap me across the face with it. Repeatedly.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-05-04,"I came into the movie theater blind. I did not know what to expect with Ari Aster&#39;s new movie, but it&#39;s that level of uncertainty that drew me in even more. I left the theater in awe and somewhat gut-punched. I had to see this movie again! Already can&#39;t wait to get it to own on 4K blu ray!!!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m gonna find this movie to be more terrifying, or hysterical... and that has me so excited. Ari sure is talented filmmaker. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s switching up his style. Almost feels like this film was made for Joaquin, it&#39;s his style of weird/funny/tragic."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Really grateful for all movies released by A24 and the support they give to innovative, talented directors with original ideas. It is refreshing to see that in the industry."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Love that Ari is really leaning into the comedy aspect of his style, this feels really unique. Can&#39;t wait to see what they&#39;ve been working on."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-28,"I understand why people dislike this film, but it is one of my new favorite films, which I almost never say about a film I&#39;ve only just seen. It officially blew my mind."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-13,"It really warms my heart to see A24 carve out their little niche and find so much success. This is what I loved about movies. It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. I want to watch big, dumb superhero popcorn flicks AND be blown away by stuff like this."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-19,"I had the pleasure of working with Joaquin as an actor in Hollywood before he was famous, and he hasn&#39; t changed a bit. He&#39;s still the same shy, modest kid he always was. And hugely talented. A million best wishes, Joaquin.."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,I love A24 movies. They&#39;re pure artistic expression. Thank The All for the boldness of Ari Aster. The All delivers and Ari goes to work. He don&#39;t give a crap what anybody thinks about his stories.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-23,"I saw film screening Beau is afraid in IMAX in Manhattan Ari Aster was interviewed by Martin Scorsese after the screening.  I will let you know that if you‚Äôre battling codependency, this is a great movie for you to see. The main character of Beau battles a lifetime of codependency brought on by his mother, not allowing him to have autonomy in his formative years.  He goes on to question all his decisions and abdicate his decision, making to others rendering him as someone who is lost in chaos, castrated by his mothers inability to allow him to choose. he ends up becoming a hypochondriac, unable to feel safe in making choices for himself. Even after his mothers, death beau still continues to drown in his own guilt brought on by his mothers constant reminders that he did not love her enough the way she needed to be loved. This movie drives the point home that for codependent person to learn to be independent, They must take the control of their decisions, cut the chains that bind them to their past and choose life decisions for themselves or die along with their codependent counterpart"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,I love how Ari has kind of created his own sub genre. I‚Äôve been dying for his next film since Midsommar. Can‚Äôt waitttttt
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,"Ari Aster + Joaquin Phoenix = An unforgettable experience <br><br>Finally, a film to be excited for"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,This looks like a positively gorgeous  insane combination of horror humor heart and an utterly bonkers tornado of weirdness. Ari just keeps getting better and better
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-06-23,I laughed. I cried. I was anxious. I was taken on a journey and felt things. This is what cinema is about. Thank you Ari Aster for making an entertaining movie for YOUR fans. This is definately not a movie for normies or people that go to movies to see the same hum-drum and archetypes you see in every movie.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,This looks like a positively gorgeous
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-19,Thank you A24 for continuing to let Artists like this shine. You guys gave me a passion for movies and going to the theater again
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,This feels like what my grandmother went through in the last few years of her life. All she wanted was to get home (even though she was home). Dementia‚Äôs not pretty üòî
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-23,"Just watched this movie. And oh my fucking god. There are no words. That was one of the craziest fever-dream odyssey style movies I‚Äôve ever seen. Ari Aster absolutely broke out of the style of Hereditary and midsommar. This was its own monster. It had parts that were extremely anxiety provoking, or were hilarious, boring or extremely intriguing. It was almost painful to watch, but afterwards i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it (in a good way). I am very impressed."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Even an Aster trailer has more love, art and awesomeness packed into it than 97% of what comes out of Hollywood these days."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"I love how Ari Aster‚Äôs third film feels so completely different than his first two films. This looks like such a fresh horror movie. Also, I don‚Äôt know if that is just a kid or really Joaquin Phoenix as the kid but they look SO SIMILAR HOLY CRAP!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-07-23,"This movie is a great example of ‚Äúart disturbs the comfortable and comforts the disturbed‚Äù. If you‚Äôre a person with anxiety and/or enjoy dark depressing humor, you‚Äôll probably enjoy this fever dream of a journey."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,This looks like Ari Aster is doing a Charlie Kaufman script and I AM HERE FOR IT.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-15,I have a weird feeling this is going to be a combination of The Truman Show &amp; Misery on steroids. Ari Aster‚Äôs first two were nothing short of masterpieces. This will eclipse both. I‚Äôm so excited for this movie and I‚Äôve been waiting for this trailer for almost two years now. LFG Beau!
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,This looks insane! Not what I was expecting at all. Definitely seeing this in theaters
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-05-01,"Seeing this in theaters last week blew me away. It definitely has it&#39;s flaws but it&#39;s such an experience you can&#39;t afford to miss it. The opening half hour was some of the funniest cinema I&#39;ve watched in a very long time and the rest is just crazy, mostly in a good way!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,I love the detail that the trailer begins in a dark way.  Almost like Ari Aster telling you &quot;See? I&#39;m the director of Hereditary&quot; But then things turn into some kind of crazy adventure through the mind of a protagonist with certain mental problems.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,A24 + Joaquin Phoenix + Ari Aster = a Masterpiece coming
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-02-20,"As chaotic as this trailer is, it fills me with peace. I can‚Äôt explain why. The ending of the trailer always gives me goosebumps"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-25,"this trailer is one of the best ever made, it got me so hyped without giving anything away. i saw the movie on its preview night last thursday and it did not disappoint! it&#39;s now in my top 5 of all movies i&#39;ve seen in the past year."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,The biggest thing about Joaquin&#39;s movies is that viscerally you feel that each character he plays is simply a true expression or extension of himself. It&#39;s a bit sad to me but I thank him in the long run for his thespian talent and the sacrifices he has made for all of us.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,The folklore that always gives birth to Ari&#39;s ideas are just as fascinating as his story telling and cinematic immersion.<br>Add A24 to the mix and this will be epic
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Ari Aster, supertramp and magnificent cast. A24 getting ready to drop another bomb. They just never disappoint."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-28,I loved this movie. I feel like someone else has my anxiety for me for a few hours.  So incredibly cathartic.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,"A24 doesn‚Äôt mess around! They continue to produce the most unique, ingenious, mind-bending films! Keep ‚Äòem coming! üòä"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"This was actually a really good trailer, showed a lot of the chaos that‚Äôs about to unfold without actually revealing too much."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-01,I feel like ari aster is going to be such an inspiration to future writers/directors because of his creativity..he has a rare talent
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-08-26,"I would do anything to see that movie again without knowing anything about it. It was a masterpiece, loved it."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,That moment when you are more excited for a trailer than you&#39;ve been all year for anything else.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,"I was in highschool when A24 started making movies and I felt like such a cool film nerd because I could recommend all the new movies to my friends and we were all equally blown away. I stopped keeping up with them a while ago just because I got away from movies, but this makes me as excited to see this as their earlier stuff did! Looks absolutely fantastic, love the style, what it might be about, and I love Joaquin Phoenix so I‚Äôll definitely see this one!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-22,"Hereditary and Midsommar are my favorite horror/thriller type movies, I‚Äôm so stoked for this movie. Ari Aster is awesome, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what he delivers with this film!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-07-25,This trailer is far more light hearted than the movie itself
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,The way Joaquin reflects every color of the human psyche is just a beautiful thing to see. He&#39;s iridescent.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-18,Ari Aster revolutionized the horror genre. His movies are exactly what i‚Äôm looking for in a horror movie.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-06-15,This film is an instant classic. Thank you Ari Aster for being so inventive and symbolic with your messaging. This film was incredibly original.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,The people that has been following ari&#39;s career knows that this tr√°iler has a lot of references of his earliest works and it makes me so exited bc you can see that this movie is probably one of his most personal works yet.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,Aster on grief and loss: terrifying <br><br>Aster on fear: hilarious
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,"After the success of ‚ÄúEverything, Everywhere, All At Once‚Äù, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see ‚ÄúBeau Is Afraid‚Äù reach that summit, especially with Joaquin Phoenix starring in a wacky, self-imploding, &amp; an artistic motion picture masterpiece with Ari Aster to direct!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-28,This is probably my favorite movie right now. It was entirely overwhelming from start to finish and incredibly funny. Whether you love it or hate it you&#39;ll never forget it.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Ari is one of the best filmmakers to come up over the past 10 years, so hyped for another amazing movie from himüëç"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"Was not expecting Aster&#39;s new film to be somewhat of a comedy, but I am all in for it!"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2024-03-18,This movie is a modern day classic. Ari aster is a genius. As far as creativity I‚Äôve never seen a movie like this before. The scene where Elaine kisses beau an the mothers like ‚Äúwhat is this‚Äù I never laughed so hard in my life
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-11,I love when a trailer leaves me confused and intrigued at the same time. Can‚Äôt wait to watch!
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"This is the most insane movie trailer I‚Äôve ever seen, I couldn‚Äôt keep up with it for a second and I have no clue what the movie will even be about. I love it."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,I feel it&#39;s definitely a film filled with thought provoking metaphors. Very excited to see this.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2025-03-07,"This movie was unlike anything I&#39;ve seen. I saw it in a cineplex theater late night showing. At the start, there were two other people with me. After the first hour, I was completely alone. I laughed, I cried, I was confused, I smiled and I felt some of the deepest dread and anxiety I had in a long time. The ending was heartbreaking and caused me to dissociate as I sat in the completely empty theater. I then had a panic attack as I rode my bicycle home. I need to watch this again."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,Love how this looks very different in tone from Midsommar and Hereditary yet you still feel uneasy in typical Aster fashion. So stocked for this !
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,I love Supertramp and I love Ari Aster. Seeing the two come together is delightful.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,"They have over 50 movies (made by them), a company that started out in 2012 by distributing independent movies, now they‚Äôve brought us masterpieces like ‚ÄúMidsommar‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Lighthouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúMen‚Äù, ‚ÄúHereditary‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt Comes At Night‚Äù, ‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù and  ‚ÄúEverything Everywhere All At Once‚Äù, i love A24, i hope they‚Äôll get the recognition that they truly deserve."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuiWDn976Ek&amp;t=25"">0:25</a>- to those that have seen this movie already, I think that this company is listed as a producer for the film, makes for a pretty great meta joke about who is making this movie and why"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-05,"Not exactly sure what this is about, but the trailer here filled me with a sense of existential dread and terror. While it&#39;s clearly visually bright and happy in a lot of ways, it&#39;s suffocatingly creepy, in an effective way. I got the impression that this is a film about anxiety, and the ever-present threat of terrible things happening if you ever dare take any risk or step outside."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"This seems like Ari&#39;s most personal film yet, and I&#39;m here for it!! This looks like a wild ride."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"I think this is gonna be a lot scarier than the trailer is making it out to be... but I also wonder if this film is gonna have a more optimistic ending, or at least not be a straight up horror film"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-05-24,"this movie is without a doubt a massively complex and unconventional, yet realistic, take on multiple different interlinking themes such as a mothers influence on her children‚Äôs later life and how their whole perception of the world can be shaped by this. i for one absolutely adored this movie, however i can understand why it won‚Äôt be for everyone. but that‚Äôs ari aster, and once you understand his vision and how he‚Äôs a truly unique filmmaker it‚Äôs hard not to respect what he‚Äôs doing. <br><br>this won‚Äôt be for everyone, this isn‚Äôt a massive hollywood blockbuster that critics will label as a ‚Äòmust see‚Äô and give 10/10 reviews to. however i can‚Äôt thank a24 enough for allowing these movies to be made for people like myself who have grown bored of conventional horror movies.<br><br>i loved this movie."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,I can&#39;t even put into words how excited I am for this masterpiece to be released.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-20,ngl ive watched this trailer like 10 times and it never fails to give me chills. this is the most hyped for a film i‚Äôve been in a second.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-18,Anything Joaquin touches is gold ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-06-17,"I can&#39;t believe I am saying this but this is probably my favorite Ari Aster film so far, Hereditary was great, Midsommar was pretty good but Beau is Afraid is on whole another level. What a film, this is cinema."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,"The colour palette, cinematography and editing made this trailer feel like a dream"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-20,"this trailer has developed an anticipatiom within me that no other movie trailer has had. it evokes a sense of wonderment and hype, I feel both ready and excited to witness Beau&#39;s odyssey. And the whole time, I&#39;m gonna be rooting for him as if he&#39;s my favorite sports player or something. its hard to describe but, this trailer just makes me feel incredibly happy. I&#39;m probably overhyping myself for the film but, I don&#39;t care. as long as the movie is at least enjoyable I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m just so happy to see a movie of this kind be made."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,Even for Ari Aster this looks completely insane. Can&#39;t wait.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-22,The kid playing little Joaquin phoenix is insanely well-cast
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-12,"I‚Äôve been obsessed with Goodbye Stranger all last year and hearing it in this trailer is like surreal and gave me goosebumps, will watch this for sure"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-04-04,"I&#39;ve been following the production of this movie for over 3 years, and I absolutely can&#39;t wait to see it. From what I know about it, Beau Is Afraid has the very likely potential to become my new favorite movie."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-17,"Ive been waiting for this since he talked about the movie years ago, so excited we finally have a trailer and can seen what kind of film it&#39;s gonna be. Super interested to see Ari finally break out of the standard horror genre(as standard as his movies are lol) and do something totally new. This totally looks like it breaks all genre conventions. Ugh, and it comes out around my bday :3. So happy."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-07-11,The most ambitious and challenging film of the year. I loved it. Let Ali Aster make more movies. And Joaquin&#39;s performance was phenomenal.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-03-16,A24 - bringing movies back to the theater that have more than superheros from comic books in them.  It feels like the 1970s again.  Good job.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,Man A24 is one wild film studio. Their stuff never disappoints !!!
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-10,Ari Aster is one of the true genuis filmmakers working in mainstream movies today and Joaquin is at the height of his powers as well. This looks absolutely bonkers and I can‚Äôt wait.
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2024-12-26,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#39;s nest meets Jacob&#39;s Ladder, yet with so many more levels. It&#39;s perhaps close to one of the most amazing films I&#39;ve seen."
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-03-08,"I‚Äôve already seen this trailer a thousand times, and it still looks amazing. And I‚Äôm also glad that Goodbye Stranger (by Supertramp) is being recognized. Thanks Ari üòä"
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-01-13,I need a remixed version of Goodbye Stranger (Supertamp) in my life right now. Since watching this trailer I&#39;ve been listening to the song on loop. I&#39;m so hyped for this movie. Thank you A24 for reigniting my movie passions! x
Beau Is Afraid,PuiWDn976Ek,2023-02-16,"This is the kind of movie I have been waiting for a long time, can&#39;t wait for it. Kudos to the director,  Joaquin, and all the people involved"
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-26,"Dennis Quaid is one of the most underrated actors of all time!  He doesn&#39;t get the recognition he deservers among the other top A listers.  I can watch his movies all day long.  The Rookie, A Dogs Purpose, I can only Imagine, Soul Surfer, The Day After Tomorrow, and so on!"
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-21,I saw it on the plane flying home and I cried the whole time ! Amazing movie ! Very uplifting! God is amazing !
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-27,Rickey was our neighbor for 15 years .  He always told us about this movie and here it is!!
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-18,"Everyone is born with a gift , this movie is motivation to keep progressing. Will see it."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-09-25,"I never met Ricky Hill,  but  his  dad James Hill was  a pastor friend to  my  pastor dad.  We attended preachers meetings in  Fort Worth, Texas together.   My brother in law  was  a  classmate of  Ricky&#39;s in  school there in  Haltom City, Texas."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-02-02,This movie made me cry multiple times! Bonnie was perfect as grandma.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-06-01,Looks great! So rare to get these types of movies about faith and hope. It is refreshing
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-06-02,"Dennis Quaid in another sports movie, I&#39;m in."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-27,He was a very brave boy that became a very brave man and had such spirit and determination that you could only admire the strength he had to endure the struggles and told to give up by so many people including his own father. He deserved all the success he got In life.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-06-14,My 17 year old son bought the 1959 Plymouth Suburban featured in this movie.  It‚Äôs cool  to see it actually running.  It‚Äôs a major rehab-needs everything LOL.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-06-01,HOLY CRAP! A movie that actually looks like the ol feel good ones I remember before Hollywood sucked.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-02-07,One of the best Dennis Quaid performances !!!!!

The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-25,My wife and I just watched the movie and it was really good. Great acting and a inspirational movie. Where I live in CA they are only showing for 2 or maybe three days.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-23,Dennis Quaid and baseball movies ate like pb and j. A match made in heaven.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-06-01,its good to see some baseball movies again like in the 90s and early 2000s
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-28,Brought me back to my childhood. üòä
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-23,"To the 288 people that disliked this trailer, I pray that America will have a revival where there&#39;s less of your worldviews around and more of Rickey hills."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-30,Dennis Quaid played in another baseball movie in 2002 call The Rookie. It was pretty good.
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-23,"This is an absolutely fantastic movie, heart-wrenching, and motivational."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-01-24,"I loved all of it! The acting, the story and the message! It&#39;s a great film for the whole family! Especially controlling fathers!üòä"

The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2024-12-31,"From a man chasing his own dreams in The Rookie ( with Rachel Griffiths) to a dad telling his son not to in The Hill. AS somebody said below, he&#39;s a great actor. I&#39;m an Aussie, so big fan of Rachel Griffiths too. If you haven&#39;t seen The Rookie , do yourself a favour. The boy in it is the actor out of 2  1/2 men. Can&#39;t remember his name, but plays it brilliantly."
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-10-14,I&#39;m buying it Lord willing
The Hill,upE1VupKCW8,2023-08-25,Jus watched this! Great movie and crazy true story!!

I&#39;m like what? The background sounds of kids chattering in the movie are the same exact kids you hear to start the song Mr. Tinkertrain. Well done, son!"

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-24,"This is going to be epic on so many levels.  Finally, we get to meet Mr. Wick&#39;s Grandfather"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-23,I loved this trailer from start to Finnish
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-01,"My family is from Finland. My grandfather was the first of my family born outside of Finland. He learned it and my dad learned it and someday I‚Äôll teach my son it. Sisu. My dad said it‚Äôs basically refusing to accept loss, to walk until you legs can‚Äôt then you crawl, you punch until your arms can‚Äôt then you kick, you study your books until your eyes burn then you listen to someone else. I am ecstatic about there being a movie about it."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-07-17,"Wow! It&#39;s amazing. 9/10 what a thrilling movie from start to end. It blew my mind considering the fact that the budget of this movie is just $6.8 million, that&#39;s an exceptional achievement they did with this film, it felt like $50 million dollar budget hollywood movie."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,This is 100% the film I didn&#39;t realise I&#39;ve been waiting for üî•
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,So this is grand grand father of john wick....
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-11,"Yet another ‚Äúone-man-army, lost his family, kill ‚Äòem all‚Äù movie. And I love it."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-04-19,"Sisu is a Finnish concept described as stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness and is held by Finns themselves to express their national character. It is generally considered not to have a literal equivalent in English. In contemporary psychology, sisu is shown to have both beneficial and harmful sides. As the movie plainly demonstrates!"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,Never mess with a Finnish commando. He will finnish you.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-09,This is the closest thing we‚Äôre going to get to a Wolfenstein movie
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-27,"As a swede, I&#39;m very happy that Finland is between us and Russia."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-18,"Just watched the movie, I‚Äôve never been satisfied in war movies like this one. Every kill , magnificent ."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-21,"Do you really believe he&#39;s immortal?<br>No, he just refuses to die.<br><br> That is the hardest line I think I&#39;ve ever heard."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,This looks batshit crazy ü§£ I was sold as soon as he threw the land mine at the one guys head üí•ü§Øü§£
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-24,The landmine to the head......I absolutely lost it üòÇ
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-04-26,"Saw this movie in a festival a couple weeks ago, it is just pure satisfaction from beginning to end. 10/10 will pay to go see it again."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,This dude is the definition of &quot;Action speaks louder than word.&quot;
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-10,"Grandmother is Finnish and I grew up in Astoria, Oregon which is a big Finnish and Scandinavian community. I knew a guy who fought in the Winter War when the Soviets tried to take over Finland and he was the only guy out of his whole machine gun crew that survived."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,"it was amazing.. I was lucky enough to be an extra in the very last scene, right next to Jorma..... and it was amazing to meet him and Onni at the premier :) I feel blessed and honoured as a foreigner to be a part (very small part) of Sisu :)"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-02,"This movie kicks A$$! From start to finish, this movie is non-stop action, blood n guts. Enjoyed every minute of this movie. Plan on seeing this again üëç"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,"When they put &quot;From the Studio behind John Wick&quot;. You know what this movie is all about. Badassery of one man that&#39;s unstoppable,"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,You had me at &quot;Wick&quot;
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NnPzpuU5ao&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> watched John wick 4 and this trailer came up . Everyone In Theater was like Ohhh!!, holy shit!!, dayum!!, Omg at this part. Everyone was applauding this trailer !"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-18,This movie was so badass. I hope they do a prequel.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-18,Moment of silence for the guy that had a fucking land mine tossed at his head üòÇüòÇ
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,"At first I thought this was going to a serious drama with a MESSAGE, but after the mayhem at the<br>truck knew it was my kind of movie. Kicking butt and taking no names, I&#39;m there !"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-08,"Sisu - &quot;no matter the odds, no matter the toil, no matter the pain, no matter the time, no matter the circumstances, <br>no matter the outcome, you don&#39;t give up&quot;"

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-26,Putting this flick on the top of the list. It looks like an amazing year for new film productions.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-04-10,"My family is half Finnish on my Mother&#39;s Side, Grandpa always talked about Suomi Finland and their Sisu when we were kids. He and I always had a special bond and it&#39;s weird I know but when I first saw this trailer as an ad on YouTube, It felt as though it was from him. Love you Papa!"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-26,"Just watched this today in Cineworld. Have to say, absolutely loved it. Great timing, acting and the setting was perfect along with the nuances within the film."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-24,Bro took ‚Äúdeath can have me when it‚Äôs earned it‚Äù to the next level
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,These days the best movies are made outside of Hollywood. Looking forward to this one.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,"I miss the Whomp-a-thon movies of the late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s. (Terminator, Rambo, Predator, Under Siege, Alien(s) et al) This looks like a worthy return of the genre from the ashes."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2024-12-28,One of the best movies I ever watched on Netflix!!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-02,I love the Nazi T59 it&#39;s so historical
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-26,"This is something I did not know was coming, yet couldn&#39;t want possibly more.  Mind blown!"

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-01,The end...&quot;we might have a problem&quot;...got me LOL.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-01,"At last straight to the point, can&#39;t wait for this &amp; until it arrives I&#39;m about to break my own record of how many times I watch a single trailer."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-24,"Pink mist, legs flying in the air, and next-level badassery? Oh, HELL yeah I&#39;m seeing this!"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-31,I haven‚Äôt been hyped for a movie in a long time but man this is gonna be a legendary film.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2025-03-03,"Fantastic movie saw it multiple times in the theater and purchased it as well.  I&#39;m an American and have never been to Finland but will one day, sounds like an amazing country.  Sisu to me is like this quote from Gen. Patton (A famous US WW2 General..). &quot;You&#39;re never beaten until you admit it.&quot;"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-27,"You know, there is something about old men in action being badass."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-25,"I really enjoyed this movie. This is as if Tarantino directed a Rambo movie. Even my wife loved the film. Half the fun was watching her look away from all the absurd violence. <br><br>Historical background: During World War II, the Lapland War saw fighting between Finland and Nazi Germany. The German troops resorted to scorched earth tactics during their retreat to Norway.<br><br>In future I hope to get more movies like this."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-20,"Literally liked it before I got to half of the trailer. This is amazing and I&#39;m not even going to finish watching the trailer, I want to watch it now!"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2025-03-20,Brilliant movie! Watched this today on Netflix and was not disappointed!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-23,"Saw it 1 month ago and planning to see it again. 1,5hrs of action from Helander. I loved this one. Amazing cinemaphotography of Lapland and brutal action 5/5 in my books."

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-24,"SISU.... is a man of focus, commitment and a sheer.... packing will."

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-11-20,"Just watched it, looooooooved it. wasn&#39;t expecting to be that good!                                                                                                                               &quot;This isn&#39;t about who&#39;s the strongest. This is about not giving up.&quot; &quot;We have a word for that in Finland.&quot;"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-24,&quot;We defeated the wrong enemy&quot; - General Patton
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-25,"I normally do not comment on trailers, but ... WOW. I am going to watch this one as soon as it hits the cinema."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2025-02-09,"&#39;&#39; SISU .. A concept not directly translatable into English which encompasses courage and resoluteness in the face of adversity.<br>The quality of character that helps individuals push through what first seemed like the boundaries of their mental or physical capacities. &#39;&#39;"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,"As long as nothing happens to that cute little doggie, I&#39;m in."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-04-06,Inglorious bastards meets John wick. What a masterpiece.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-08,"Saw the movie a few weeks ago, here in Finland. It was better than I anticipated."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2025-04-30,Love this movie. Maybe my most enjoyable film experience this year so far. I&#39;m going to watch it again!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-24,"In truth, I would prefer this movie done in Finnish with subtitles. Phonetically, Finnish is a hauntingly beautiful language."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,Looks like I‚Äôve found my new favourite movieüòç
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-19,Hell yeah! Just saw it and it was hardcore BADASS! Instantly one of my favorite War-Action üé¨ movies! Lead Actor was perfect for that part üëçüëçüî•üî•üî•

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-27,Are there any films where the good guys win?
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,The Hugo Stiglitz movie we all deserve!!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-09-05,This movie was criminally underrated
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,"I have never heard anything about this and NOW, I must see this movie.  Well done movie maker and well done trailer, well done."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-09-13,"A beautiful and brilliant film that has remained exciting from start to finish. The storyline and music comes across a lot with Quentin Trantino&#39;s film &quot;Inglourious basterds&quot; All the actors played their roles well and the location was extremely exceptionally beautiful. unfortunately the turnout is not that big in the Netherlands, I had a private performance at Kinopolis Breda. I had the whole cinema room to myself, on to part two..."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-01,"to all the armchair historians getting triggered that &quot;Finns were axis allies&quot; and that &quot;why are soviets being the real enemy ignored&quot;<br>1. The movie takes place during the 1944 Lapland War, where after Finns made peace with Soviets, they then ended up fighting the Germans for about a year. The Germans were retreating to Norway and burned lot of northern Finland down, hence the conflict.<br>2. The main hero is a war veteran of Winter War, and described as a bane of Soviets who has killed about 300+ of them and earned the nickname Koschei. That hardly sounds like ignoring to me. It&#39;s well established this movie does NOT favour the commies nor nazis. They were both killed by the main hero after all."
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-28,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NnPzpuU5ao&amp;t=89"">01:29</a> wow i&#39;m amazed that this time the enemies was surprisingly accurate on their aim only hitting the shield ü§£ü§£"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-07-25,Just watched it. One hell of a action packed movie from start to finish. The main character was simply awesome. He just refuse to die.üôèüíØ
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-15,"Niiice! We need more movies like this. Miss the great 80s and early 90s action movies. I mean it‚Äôs just a trailer, but looks awesome!müòÖ"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-05-29,All about gold. The lesson of the story is that never steal anything from anyone. Great movie!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2025-03-30,Apart from the fact that Germany was Finlands biggest ally in World War Two. And that the Germans where prepared to take in finish refugees if the soviets had fully won. <br>Cool movie!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-04-26,This is the first trailer I‚Äôve been impressed by in a long time.
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-22,This was absolutely amazing film. It¬¥s from the same director who made Rare exports santa film.

Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-24,"So lemme get this straight, the premise of the film is that he has to fight Nazis, on his way to a Jewish bank?"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-02-21,"A mix of Inglorious Bastards, Fury, and John Wick... Count me in!"
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-03-13,WHEN THE TRAILER IS SUCH A BOMB YOU CANT JUST SAY COMING SOON WITHOUT GIVING A DATE!!!
Sisu,2NnPzpuU5ao,2023-06-27,I will name my next Chihuahua dog SISU!! Bad ass indeed.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,Love how you didn&#39;t show Han solo cause he was one of the cliffhangers in Empire
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-01,You know a movie is magical when a fanmade trailer for it makes you feel chills despite having already seen it hundreds of times.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-08,"The ending celebration music in this movie is so underrated, and it was so cool to hear it dramatized for this trailer"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"I watched it last night on the big screen. There are definitely times when it looks like a 40 year old movie, but the heart of it is still as strong as ever. I took my 12 year old son, he&#39;d never seen it, and he loved it. That&#39;s all that matters."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,That choral and orchestral rendition of the end celebration theme was so good holy shit.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,I went to watch this in theaters for their anniversary re-release. And my god what a feeling it was to watch such a defining movie in theaters like the way it was nearly 40 years ago. Spectacular experience. Makes me appreciate this franchise more and more with every new and old piece of content
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"I remember watching this film with my late father, when that celebration music kicks in...... I wasn&#39;t ready for it.......thank you for this"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2024-02-21,"Its been decades since I watched this a thousand times as a boy...would mime quietly word for word, and it never got old or dull. Might be time to watch it again. Especially after this amazing new trailer."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,Saw ROTJ last night at a theater in Hollywood; what an incredible experience it was! Never thought I‚Äôd ever have the opportunity of seeing my favorite Star Wars film on the big screen and lemme tell ya it brought tears to my eyes!
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,Amazing. Brought tears to my eyes. I was lucky enough as a kid to see the remastered original trilogy with my dad and brother. If the trailer back then was this...holy crap it would have been insane.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-04,I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve seen RotJ and this Modern Trailer absolutely gave me goose bumps and all the feels.  May the 4th be with you AD!
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"Love it bro, I like how you kept a lot of mystery but managed to make it feel like a celebration‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a nice blend ‚ù§Ô∏èüíö"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"AD I hope one day a major film franchise notices you. Your ability to tell a story without saying much is truly breath taking. You‚Äôre an artist, my friend. I‚Äôve been here for years and I‚Äôll never leave ‚ù§"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcQKTTwLA-Y&amp;t=69"">1:09</a> that music cue is from the ending of ROTJ. Gave me absolute chills when I recognized it here"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-07,"I&#39;m 46 years old and the first time I saw Star Wars was in my country in a big arena they had a big projector and you could watch it at night outside... I have never forgotten that feeling, thank you for the reminder &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-07,"You did something I imagined they should have done to introduce Episode 7, the Endor Celebration Theme!! This theme is criminally underrated, underused and under appreciated! I literally got goosebumps and chills. It is such a fitting theme for not only Episode 6, but they could have used it throughout the sequel trilogy, or at least for the beginning of Episode 7 (orchestral version). Anyway, thank you very much for this and your understanding of proper Star Wars storytelling, and your recognition of important Star Wars themes!!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,The Emperors&#39; voice is still so chilling. GOOSEBUMPS
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-01,Wow... You‚Äôre a genius.  Brought me right back to the early 2000‚Äôs. <br><br>That victory music always moves me to tears. So beautifully composed. It‚Äôs essence of joy. <br><br>No Han Solo = A++ move. Very clever.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"I saw the original release with my dad and 2 brothers. It was such an amazing movie for a 9 year old. Thanks dad, for the life-long memory."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-28,The choice of Williams&#39; ROTJ themes is genius. Got teary eyes.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,epic.  i saw it in theater alone last night and cried more than i thought i would.  this story is more than just a fictional movie.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"trying very hard right now not to cry cause this was mine and my mom&#39;s favorite movie of the original trilogy. this year marked the 40th anniversary of this movie and this month also marked 2 years since we lost her to cancer. she would have loved this trailer you did. thank you, brother."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"Takes me back to the good days back when I was a kid. Times are different now. The fact that Disney isn‚Äôt even promoting the 40th anniversary is just sad though, how could it have come to this?"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-10,"This movie is slowly re-becoming my favorite Star Wars film. It just means so much. I‚Äôve seen it a dozen times, and this still got me hype AF. Congrats on a great job!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-02,"Ah to be 16 again in 1983, waiting in line for the midnight showing at the Beaver Valley 6 cinemas with my best friend and Dad- he was a huge Star Wars fan, too.  The gasps and the cheers and the tears in that theater will never be forgotten!  Good job!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,Many Bothans died to bring us this trailer<br>Great anniversary trailer Alex ü•≥üëç
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,Took me a few seconds to realise that was Victory Celebration. What a fantastic use of that wonderful music
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,Jesus the Victory Celebration was absolutely perfect for the tone of the trailer! Well done!!
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2024-08-17,"Watching this I was transported back to May 25th, 1983. Was first in line to see Return of the Jedi. Got there at 6am. Theater didn‚Äôt open until 11. It was damn well worth the wait."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-05,"Star Wars has shown me Honor, Destiny, and the true meaning of the Force. Thank you for this tribute. May the 4th be with us and happy 40th anniversary for Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-03,"Great job, editing this trailer.<br>Made me want to watch the movie again. You really can&#39;t deny the effect the OT Star Wars trilogy had.<br>The wonder, suspense and emotions these movies gives, is beyond anything Disney&#39;s Star Wars ever managed."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"I&#39;m generally not a fan of most modern trailers, but this brought a couple of tears to my eyes! When Star Wars (well, Hollywood in general) was still good. Really, really good! Thank you, well done!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"Great work.<br>I know that for some, this is their least favourite of the Trilogy, but I love it above all others.  <br>  It shows, for the first time, Luke as the absolute badass he was becoming, far away from the whiny but likeable farm boy we first met.  His titanic courage in willingly facing both his father and Sidious, knowing it would most likely be a one-way trip, is truly inspiring.<br>   It shows the triumphant return, brief and bittersweet though it was, of Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight, as he finally destroys the hated Emperor.<br>   Ok, ok, and we get to see the beautiful Carrie Fisher ( rest in peace, dear Princess.) not wearing very much.  <br>Long live &quot;Return of tge Jedi!&quot;"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,a really beautiful tribute to the anniversary of this masterpiece. Plus the music from the victory celebration. Simply perfect. Thank you.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,LOVED how you made it seem like Luke was training with Vader! Makes me wonder how that dynamic would actually look like
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,The music took me a second to recognize but using a variation on the Celebration theme... just excellent!
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-04,"ok, ok, the music made it AMAZING"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-03,This is absolutely perfect. I wish this was the official trailer. Love how it didn‚Äôt show Han or Palpatine either‚Ä¶and it still was epic.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-01,"This was brilliant. Thank you for making it. I especially appreciated the attention to detail in using the Special Edition Celebration theme as the theme for the trailer, a nice use of foreshadowing the conclusion to the story, and I also also appreciated that you deliberately chose not to reveal the fate of Han Solo. Perfect. Thank you. üêæ"

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,I love these movies so much. Every time I see one of your trailers I tear up.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-10-31,"Dadgum, that&#39;s a great trailer. It took me a few seconds - maybe ten-fifteen - to recognize the music, because I&#39;ve never heard this version. It&#39;s beautiful, and gives this trailer a completely different vibe than it would have had if music direct from the film&#39;s soundtrack had been used."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"Going to go see this movie with my dad today, can‚Äôt wait"

I am also a member of the BLUE HARVEST GANG (the San Diego fans who saw the entire Sarlacc shoot, we spent more time in the desert than Erwin Rommel and LFL just did a tribute to all of us at Celebration London -- I know, I can&#39;t believe it either, please don&#39;t do the math, thank you ... and thank you so VERY much for remembering us, we can&#39;t believe it.) You did an incredible job on this trailer. I&#39;m just going to pretend I saw THIS version."

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"best part about this is that you left out all of the best bits and didn&#39;t give us THE WHOLE MOVIE in two minutes. you even left out HAN! And the Second Death Star! Excellent work! No sarlac either! This is how trailers are supposed to be made.<br><br>I truly wish that all film trailers had the same restraint, and were assembled with the same talent. I admire your work, keep it up!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-29,"Very nice, honestly may be the best one yet. FANTASTIC job with collab/music of the trailer...wow! I went to my theater yesterday night to celebrate, going again tomorrow :3<br>Thanks @AD_edits"

Thank you. I&#39;m not much of a gamer but I&#39;d be interested in one of your styled trailers for the Jedi Fallen Order &amp; Jedi Survivor games.
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-04-30,"This is EXCELLENTLY done! <br><br>My only critique is that including the line from Yoda about &quot;confronting your father&quot; would confirm that Vader was indeed telling the truth to Luke in ESB, when in reality it was still unknown by audiences if Vader was lying or not until Jedi."
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi2023 Re-release,EcQKTTwLA-Y,2023-05-06,..still gives the chills..

Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-18,"An original movie that is not a prequel, sequel, franchise, reboot or do-over. How very excellent."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-18,"I  know Michelle Yeoh is already a legend, but how honestly refreshing to see an action hero film staring a 59 year old asian woman kicking ass being a wife and a mum. We need stories like this!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-10,Just saw it. This was not a movie. This was a Modern Masterpiece. Please go experience this in theaters. 10/10. 5 Stars. We aren&#39;t going to get another movie as spectacular as this for a LONG time.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-04-09,"What I loved about this movie is either you don‚Äôt get it, or it hits. And when it hits, it HITS."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-15,"A BIG lesson to Hollywood here, take a calculated risk and reap huge rewards. This film will win every award that&#39;s landed on it."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-08-09,"i dont think there will be another movie where they can make two rocks talking with each other in a form of texts in the most cinematic, beautiful and astonoshing way possible"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-15,I have no idea what&#39;s going on and it looks amazing.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-03-09,"How does this movie take such random things- like a rock, a bagel, a raccoon and googly eyes, and turn them into something that can make anyone cry. Masterpiece"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-28,"When a movie with &#39;only&#39; a $25 million budget, does the whole multiverse thing better than a multi-billion dollar franchise. Absolutely loved every single second of this masterpiece. You&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, you&#39;ll think &#39;WTF?!&#39;. Ending was maybe a bit abrupt but still, amazing movie."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-23,"My wife and I cried, laughed, cried then laughed again in the theatres. Went home, felt some existential crisis, cried again for a good 30 minutes then laughed remembering all the silly scenes. Easily my top 1 movie of all time for bringing me and my wife on a roller coaster ride. It deserves all the praise and none of the hate."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,"I think this is the first true action movie from A24, and I couldn&#39;t be more excited. Always happy to see Michelle Yeoh"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-04-23,"I&#39;m ashamed that I waited so long to watch this film. What a beautiful, poignant, funny, emotional movie this is.  Everything from the story, the themes, the writing, the acting, and the editing makes this movie a masterpiece of cinema. Michelle Yeoh puts on a tour-de-force performance for the ages and she deserves every award she won. The same goes for the movie. I&#39;ve seen iconic movies from Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future and this movie should be held in the same regard as those classics. It&#39;s absolutely incredible and is quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-12,Went into this movie completely blind‚Äînever watched the trailer or anything‚Äîand it was such a mind-blowing experience. I cannot recommend this movie enough. 10/10 just experienced the whole breadth of human emotion. What a genuine masterpiece.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-20,"Not just a movie. This was the most absurd, profound, hilarious, deeply moving, hardest hitting, and inspirational piece of cinema I have ever experienced. Genuinely. It is ridiculous yet meticulously crafted. I had tears from laughter, sobbed from sadness, and cried from joy. It shouldn&#39;t work, but it did, and I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it since I saw it. Please go support this movie!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-18,"I&#39;ve always loved Yeoh, and FINALLY Hollywood is giving her the starlight she deserves"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-07-07,This movie changed my whole perspective on my life and my family. This is beyond incredible. Brings me to tears everytime. Thank you for this movie.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-21,"1. Michelle Yeoh is always on point<br>2. We need to support more films like this, even if they end up not being the best, because it paves the way for more creative films and not the usual junk"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-15,"Hearing Michelle Yeoh saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me fight you. I‚Äôm really good.‚Äù is worth the price of the ticket!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-20,"I saw this film last night. I cannot sing its praises enough. I didn‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve seen something more ridiculous, hilarious, heartfelt, jaw dropping, and radically original. I want this to win Best Picture."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-05-11,The way this movie literally encapsulates everything I have ever imagined in my mind what it means to be human
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-06,"Just came out of a prescreening and IT WAS AMAZING. This isn&#39;t a modern masterpiece, it is literally a CINEMATIC LANDMARK. I hope A24 works their asses off to campaign and promote this for more people to see, and for award bodies to recognize. Through the entire movie, me and everyone in the theater was laughing their asses off in one scene, and then they hit you with a deeply touching scene that could make you cry. The absolute craftsmanship of this movie is nuts, it might be a little weird but i assure you, if you just let yourself into it, you will be absolutely love this movie"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,Just wanted to give a shout out to Ke Huy Quan from Goonies and Indiana Jones!   Great to see him back at it!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-02,"Just watched this film in the theater. This is definitely the biggest surprise and the best film I watched in a long time. Telling the core story of conflict, identity, and love within a Chinese American family through the use of multiverse, with an insane, bizarre, yet extremely rich visual style, man this is so good I can&#39;t wait to see it again in the theater."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-04-10,"This film has it all. Outstanding performances. Excellent direction as well as writing. I loved how the visual effects are employed to complement the plot rather than being the main focus of the film. It is both emotionally charged and action-packed. It delivers a powerful message while retaining a plausible story. It was perplexing as well as interesting, and it left me wanting more."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-03,This movie was so much more than I could have expected. Blew me away on every level. Very crazy and very touching. Loved it and cannot wait to to watch it again.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-09-26,"My dad randomly found this film and we decided to watch it today. Throughout the movie we laughed and we smiled at the pure fun wackiness of it all. But once the credits came on‚Ä¶ we just cried. Both of us, crying tears of joy. We then hugged for about 5 minutes and he said something on the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to have you in this life.‚Äù That is by far one of the most heart felt experiences I‚Äôve ever shared with my dad. I‚Äôll never forget how much this film reminded me on why I loved my family."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,This is probably the best trailer I&#39;ve seen this year. What a batshit crazy approach. Throwing everything but the kitchen sink in it and it all sticks. Color me excited.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-25,"This is not the movie we deserved, but the movie we needed. Thank you @A24! So many parallels to life."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,This multiverse/multiple versions of the ‚Äúself‚Äù concept is something I really think about a lot‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt wait to see this. Michelle Yeoh is the best!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-28,Spoilers ahead but...<br>If a movie can make you cry at the intimacy shared between two women with <b>hotdog fingers</b> as one plays the piano with her feet... you know it&#39;s a modern masterpiece. And I mean that completely sincerely as high praise
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,There‚Äôs something so special about Michelle Yeoh. I can‚Äôt tell what it is but I find her screen presence truly compelling. This movie looks bonkers in all the right ways.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-03-13,"This is how a movie should be made, comedy, action, emotional, storytelling.. it deserves all the awards its won."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,I grew up watching Michelle Yeoh kicking ass and seeing her STILL kicking ass at that age just brings a smile to my face...
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-03-31,"this is honestly the best most original film I have seen in years, not at one point could I predict where it was going, it feels so new to be surprised by movies these days. Loved every second."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-03-18,"Watched this tonight at the Alamo Drafthouse and it was a masterpiece. An amazing blend of comedy, commentary on inter generational trauma, and existential philosophy. 10/10"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-08-15,The fact that this covers the concepts of  at least 11 dimensions in a time frame of a non-epic (in length) movie after I tried to learn and grasp my mind around them is so mind boggling and impressive. Kudos to everyone who worked on this.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,Finally a movie with Michelle Yeoh as a lead using her amazing skills I cannot wait!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-03,I‚Äôm a film buff and this is legitimately one of the best movies i have ever seen in my 31 year life. PLEASE PLEASE GO WATCH IN THEATERS.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-24,Literally just got back from the theaters. This film is so different than anything else out there. It&#39;s so absurd and chaotic yet touching and heartfelt at the same time. This instantly became probably my favorite movie ever. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie!!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-01-06,"What makes this film incredible is how it tells many different stories all of which are linked to one central message and ultimately, one story. Not many films manage to accomplish that!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-11,"Marvel: after 14 years of building our cinematic universe, we are finally ready to dive into the madness that is the multiverse. Can anyone make it cooler than us?<br>A24: hold my googly eyes"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-07-25,This is the most life affirming film I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs not often a film comes along that changes your life but this one did
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-19,"Michelle Yeoh is so damn underrated. She&#39;s an incredibly versatile actress; she&#39;s brilliant in drama, action, comedy, or whatever else."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-05-05,The fact they use multiverse in a regular movie like this to make it entertaining is a brilliant idea. We always see the multiverse in DC and Marvel shows but for once they use it to make a regular movie into a masterpiece.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-07-30,"I know I&#39;m late to the party, and this movie has been out for over 4 months now, but this movie was just absolutely INSANE. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a movie, show or game that&#39;s managed to provoke such thought in my mind. At first, I thought there was no way this movie could be as crazy as people said it was, but it somehow managed to be even crazier. Just such an interesting movie that does so many things I&#39;ve never seen anything like before. I can&#39;t really explain what this movie was exactly like,  it&#39;s so unlike anything, but all I can say is that it was an absolutely FANTASTIC movie. I will definitely never forget this wonderfully bonkers masterpiece of an experience."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-15,The directors of Swiss Army Man directed this
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-07-11,"Watched the movie and it felt like I went to therapy for 2 damn years. It has a deep meaning to it that you just can&#39;t find in other modern movies. You&#39;ll laugh, cry, and learn to appreciate things around you. It examines nihilism, existentialism, and everything in between. We live in a world (or a universe lol) where all of us are just here on borrowed time when we will eventually  cease to exist and return to dust. But, if we choose to, we can make this inevitable journey of life to death a little bit more meaningful if we love, appreciate, and make the most of what we have. Because &quot;nothing matters&quot; is the reason why everything matters. :) 100/10 one of my most favorite movi- I mean, pieces of art I have ever encountered."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-30,This movie earned each and every single Oscar it got and more
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-06-06,"One of the dumbest, nonsensical, random, unique, genius, heartwarming, well thought-out, well executed movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. This movie was literally everything at the same time. I was in a constant cycle of confusion an understanding.i enjoyed it quite alot. It&#39;s a movie that doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously while at the same time giving you a good story. It&#39;s meant to be enjoyed, not criticized."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-15,"I need this movie now. This is the film we need. Creative storytelling. Inject it in my veins, NOW!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-19,This is the first movie in 3 years that I&#39;m actually looking forward to. Michelle Yeoh is one of the most underrated actors ever &amp; this project looks amazing. I&#39;m excited that I&#39;m excited.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-09-15,"I genuinely cannot believe this movie exists. It&#39;s just so out-of-this-world, magnificent, transcendent, and beautiful that it defies explanation. Not only is it a cinematic masterpiece, it sets a new gold standard of what cinema as an art-form can achieve. It&#39;s my No.1 favourite film of all time now, by a significant margin. Movies like this truly only come around once in a lifetime..."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-06-12,"I watched this movie after having a huge fight with my mom without knowing what the film was about. Needless to say, I cried a lot. The way this portrayed the mother daughter bond was amazing. It just felt so much like me and my mom. Fucking phenomenal movie."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-02-21,"seeing an older Asian female character written with nuance, power and magic bring tears to my eye. its not representation, it gives an overlooked demographic their flower. Beyond that this looks fricking ballllerrrrrr"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-31,"In not gonna lie, I expected very little with this movie. Didn&#39;t expect a good story at all. But after watching several reviews, trusted people I decided to give it a shot. I can safely say that this is a hilarious movie, with good acting, great storytelling, beautiful emotional and character development, and superb cinematography. I don&#39;t cry at movies, but I almost did at this excellent film. It made me have faith in movies again, and I would not take that experience back!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-07-06,"After watching this movie 5 times I can say with all respect that the Oscar to best support actress is for Stephanie Hsu. She is just amazing, the acting, faces, feelings ... At the end all are good in this movie. Just love it"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,"OKAY I am so excited for this! They shared the plot of the movie without any spoilers, looks like it will be funny and action packed, and its friggin Michelle Yeoh! I love that woman. Definitely going to watch this movie when it comes out."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,"This looks like one of those movies I&#39;m insanely hyped to see, but that I will forget about by the time its out and re-discover two years later. So... someone, remind me when I can watch this."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-09,This movie was a masterpiece. Felt literally every emotion. It has a beautiful message.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-08-04,this was the most beautiful hollywood film I&#39;ve seen in years. still. and it&#39;s 2024.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-18,This movie did the whole &quot;Multiverse&quot; thingy better than MCU for sure.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,"There is no way that I am going to miss seeing this. Even if I have to buy the script and act out all the parts, I will see this film. It looks so good! ‚ôæüé≠"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-19,"You‚Äôll laugh, you‚Äôll cry, you‚Äôll really ask yourself what the hell just happened, but at the end of the movie you will feel something you may have not felt in such a long time. 10/10 for this beautiful storytelling venture into what truly matters in a world of many different possibilities. This movie will truly make you feel everything everywhere all at once üôåüèæ"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-07-21,"It&#39;s been like 1 year and 4 months, there&#39;re still 0 movies that have the same emotional impacts on me like Everything Everywhere All At Once"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-22,This is one of the best movies EVER made. It&#39;s a mind altering cinematic experience that takes you through all ranges of emotions. The storyline and directing is exceptional. Michelle Yeoh&#39;s performance was beyond spectacular. One of the best movies ever made. Period.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-26,"I didn&#39;t cry until the drive back home from the movie theater. Everything hit me at once and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#39;t seem to stop crying, smiling, and laughing. This movie is an EXPERIENCE and was worth my time."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-03-19,"Something is so melancholic about this trailer, when she says &quot;I just want to be with you&quot;. Knowing all the endless possible lives you may experience as a person in the multiverse; rich, talented, poor, silly, perfect life,  etc.. where you are now is where you need to be, as your self and with the people you know and love. Forsure David bowie&#39;s music sells that feeling."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-04-24,The most creative mindfuckery i&#39;ve seen ever. Such a powerful movie. You laugh and get hooked and get your mind fucked and then get sad and so on. A crazy rollercoaster. So so so creative. Deserves the Oscars success. Brilliant movie
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-28,"For an Westernized Asian woman, Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is about my mother and me. Our struggle to understand each other on display in the deepest, yet most innovatively bonkers way. How all her sacrifices have brought me up to who I am and where I am, but also brought me down in a single snide. I will never forget how a film can bring me so much tears of hurt and joy."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-17,"Just watched. I haven&#39;t heard a theatre reacted so strongly to a movie in a LONG time (I also live in a country where theatre audiences aren&#39;t super reactive). We laughed, we cried, we cheered, sometimes all at once. Like many people have said, this movie is a LANDMARK for cinema and storytelling in general and I&#39;m so glad I got to see it in theatres. You will either REALLY love it or REALLY hate it and I honestly don&#39;t care, JUST GO WATCH THIS MOVIE."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-13,"This movie makes you cry and then burst out in laughter 2 seconds later, felt like putting a large spoonful of sugar, chilli powder, and lemon juice in my mouth and chewing it at the same time"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-01-08,"Just finished watching the movie. What i can say is, Incredible. What a brilliant concept of a movie. It&#39;s complicated and yet, it&#39;s not."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,Sooo excited to see Michelle Yeoh ! This looks like an excellent adventure!!! YAY A24!!!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-13,"This movie just won seven freakin‚Äô Oscars, including Best Picture. Congrats to everyone involved in it. Now I gotta watch it one of these days!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-06-16,"This movie shook me to the core and I cried like I haven&#39;t let myself cry in the past 2 years. I know a lot of people are talking about the inter-generational trauma within the Asian American community, but I must say, it hits home for the Asians living in Asia too (east, south east, south, middle east, central, ALL OF US). Joy&#39;s relationship with Evelyn was so painstakingly similar to my and many of my friends&#39; life experiences. Loving your family can be the hardest thing you do sometimes."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-04-01,I just got done watching this movie and I can say it was one of the most enjoyably bizarre movies I&#39;ve have seen in a long time and if I&#39;m being honest the last few minutes of the movie got way to real for me and I almost started crying.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-20,"I&#39;m actually pissed the movie didn&#39;t receive 9+ on IMDB. Movie is phenomenally written, directed and delivered. A masterpiece from beginning all the way to the end of closing credits."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,"The directors of Swiss Army Man directed this. And ever since I&#39;ve seen this film pop up on IMDb for 5 years now, its finally here! I can not be more excited for this than I imagined it! Also, its even more shocking and amazing that its an action film!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis on screen together? Legend meets legend. Iron sharpens iron. No way I miss this.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-01-28,WOW. Did not watch the trailer beforehand. I am both upset at not watching this earlier and delighted to have experienced it tonight. I can‚Äôt express how much I needed to hear the lessons this taught and feel the emotions I felt. It was incredibly relatable and made me feel so proud of my Chinese background. I‚Äôve found my new favorite movie. Thank you.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,"There&#39;s even an animated universe, this looks insane."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-08,"I saw this last week and was blown away.  Amazing action, originality, comedy, and above all else a well written and very heart-felt story.  I was excited to see the movie and was still blown away.  It&#39;s definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.  I&#39;m going back to rewatch it and catch all the things I missed the first time through.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  We need more movies like this!!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-03-26,"When I see a movie I&#39;ve enjoyed above all else, I usually qualify my reaction by saying it&#39;s only &quot;one of&quot; my favorite movies of all time. After seeing this a few nights ago and not being able to stop talking, thinking, and obsessing over it, this is the first time I can honestly say... this IS my favorite movie of all time. This is why we go to the movies, and I&#39;m going to be chasing the highs and lows of everything this made me ~feel~ for a long time."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2024-03-30,"There was a time when I always used to say that Michelle Yeoh is my favourite actress. She was so beautiful. After watching this movie, and watching her in close shots she is not only so beautiful but also so graceful. She was beautiful and graceful when she was just a rock. <br>Thanks for the movies"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-18,These are the type of movies I love. Can&#39;t wait for this one looks like a trip.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-29,"Singlehandedly the best movie I&#39;ve seen in the last 10 years. Touched me to the core and tingled all the right nerves. Absolutely, without a doubt, a Modern Masterpiece."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-04-07,This is the first movie in years I‚Äôm going to see in theaters
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-08-21,I don&#39;t cry while watching movies - like ever. But this film made me bawl. Not just cry. BAWL. So so so good oh my God!!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-14,"Across all the universes, we live in the one where this movie makes history as the most-awarded film of all time. I sobbed a lot watching the Oscars last night. I&#39;m going to rewatch it and bring back all the feelings this movie has brought me. Just revolutionary!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-14,this looks amazing! I think this is the first movie trailer in years that just has me completely hyped without a bit of doubt. I hope the situation next year will allow for a relatively regular cinema start everywhere because this belongs on the big screen!
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,"This is like Jet Li&#39;s &quot;The One&quot; meets the Wachowskis &quot;Sense8&quot;, but it is completely it&#39;s own unique style and flavour. I&#39;m super impressed and excited! Finally something fun, fresh, playful and creative!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2025-04-09,"this movie is a strange case of either you don&#39;t get it and hate it , or you get it and it hits very hard this movie made me cry."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-18,"Regardless of the quality of the movie, this has to be one of the greatest trailers I&#39;ve ever seen"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-21,"Exceptional writing and execution. It goes bat-shit crazy and yet contains so much heart. Pushing the limits of filmmaking at it‚Äôs best!! This movie will make you laugh, wonder, cry and smile :‚Äô)"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-05-28,"(Warning: may contain spoilers)<br>I don&#39;t know why I bawled my eyes out in that scene between Michelle and her daughter when the latter said nothing really matters. Maybe because I can identify myself with her nihilistic notion that the idea of destroying one&#39;s self is the only way she could see to achieve peace, and I can really relate to that on a very personal level because I&#39;ve been in that position many times. The Everything Bagel was like a metaphor for suicide, and I was so glad that there was someone like Evelyn who made Jobu realized that despite inevitable failures and rejections, amidst all the chaos in the universe, we can still find tiny specks of pure happiness when shared with our loved ones, no matter how fleeting these moments can be, and that they&#39;re enough to make us feel alive and get going. Despite seeing boundless possibilities of greatness in other worlds, Evelyn still chose to be in that moment with her daughter, the joy of her life, despite all her flaws and queerness. The vastness and infiniteness of time and space may make us feel like we don&#39;t matter, like nothing matters, but Evelyn made us realize that we matter to someone. This film is an ode to parenthood, an observation into the mind of loneliness, and an exercise of acceptance, freedom, and enduring hope."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-06-04,I loved that this movie is about manifesting. Meditating your ideal self and becoming that person. I also love that indeed it is very much similar to how we are today. With social media and the many distractions that we somehow stopped truly connecting as human making us more and more depressed. We are in a very much connected world but very isolated too. And how it tackles breaking generational traumas that can be passed down to generations. I love this movie over all.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-17,Omg this is what I never knew I was waiting for. Michelle Yeoh is an absolute force and icon. What an incredible career she‚Äôs had. I cannot wait for this
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2021-12-19,"Awww so happy for the Daniels! I met them way back when they were at Emerson College, and they were always such positive, smart, and creative artists. It&#39;s been super fun to watch them grow from college festivals, music videos, and now full feature films."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2022-03-25,"I saw this tonight at Alamo in San Francisco and it was superb. I would give it a 10/10. It‚Äôs a really powerful story about our multidimensional selves, healing family trauma, allowing instead of resisting, and honoring our loved ones - and ourselves - through thick and thin. It‚Äôs about chaos and order while giving heavy doses of each to compare and contrast. I laughed and cried and I can‚Äôt wait to see it again. That is very rare. BRAVO!!"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,wxN1T1uxQ2g,2023-03-30,Not me watching this movie on the same day as I filed my taxes üòÇ
Dunki,Zd69FfhBmSc,2024-02-20,"As a Romanian who watched this in England, I have to say, 10/10!!"

Dunki,Zd69FfhBmSc,2024-08-20,"Everyone should see this movie. As an Italian who worked in a shelter for asylum seekers for 4 years, this movie sent me in tears. I&#39;ve tried my best to help people do what Manu and her friends did, I used my professional reputation as a psychologist to support asylum requests to the court, I prepared beds for people who arrived with fever and dehydration from the Africa-Italy &quot;dunki&quot; via Mediterranean sea, I took women to the hospital who were pregnant from what Manu narrowly escaped. One of the many times I took some newcomers to the immigration office for application, I took them eat afterwards and there was a TV there, showing the highlights of a football match. The guys were very interested, they said they had been following that championship, and as they eagerly watched the TV I thought that they had dreaded to be not alive anymore to see that final. That simple, even trivial moment made me fully realize how deeply unfair and nonsense these borders and inequalities are. We are all humankind, we should all have the same power, the same chances. We all belong to the world, we don&#39;t own parts of it."

I look forward to it!¬†<br><br>They need to keep making these with different vehicles: perhaps one where he gets a shadowy phone call while in a canoe (&quot;don&#39;t even think about coming ashore until you&#39;ve killed the other people in the canoe!&quot;)... or one where an unknown puppet master contacts him on the Space Shuttle (&quot;If you don&#39;t perform these specific zero-g experiments as I&#39;ve described, your oxygen will be terminated!&quot;) <br><br>Frankly, I&#39;d see all of them!"
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-07-01,"Best man for the role, no one else can do it better than him. Let‚Äôs Rock Liam!üéâ"
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2024-06-27,He&#39;s such a great actor ! He&#39;s my favourite since watching Taken.
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-06-29,From the producer of Non-Stop and The Commuter‚Ä¶ comes a movie with the exact same plot. I can‚Äôt wait üòÅ
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-06-28,I‚Äôll watch any Liam Neeson movie. Maybe not always in theaters but I‚Äôll get around to renting/streaming it at some point.
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-06-28,"At this point his films should simple be called, ‚ÄúLiam Neeson‚Äôs‚Äù and we‚Äôll know exactly what we‚Äôre going in for."

Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-06-30,I was just thinking I miss the Liam Neeson action era from 2008-15. Good to see him back in the saddle again.
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-07-16,Neeson really shows his range as an actor in a plot style that has never been done before. Who would think he could play a father who goes to desperate and deadly measures to protect his family?!

Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-07-30,"Best part about this is that the action takes place entirely inside a car, so the aging Neeson doesn&#39;t have to pretend to jump over a fence in 30 different cuts! <br>Pure acting from his part, which is why most of us watch his movies!"
Retribution,jzQn0-WH4WM,2023-06-28,He never ever disappoint

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-10-25,"As Pastor of a Church I was offered a sneak preview of Journey to Bethlehem ‚Äì along with my wife and kids.  This movie is simply outstanding!<br>This is simply a beautiful retelling of the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.  The costumes are good, the scenery and camera work create a worthy visual experience.  The actors are well chosen and extremely likeable.  This movie has managed to stay Biblically accurate and yet allow the characters to be human ‚Äì like we are.  There are real emotions and humor displayed, which allow us to connect more deeply with the reality and depth of this story.<br>I am trained in classical music and Theology and can say that I was pleased in many ways with this musical movie.  The Jewish elements of arranged weddings, customs, agriculture and travel were all well depicted.  I had wondered how they would handle the place of birth and was impressed that even in this detail this movie chose the correct locale.<br>Few are aware of just how dangerous and deranged King Herod was, and this movie along with a very credible performance by Antonio Banderas give Herod all that delusional jealousy and megalomania.  History has shown that Herod had his wife, her mother, her brother and 3 of his sons murdered. Banderas shows off his vocal abilities and truly brings his character Herod to center stage with a full range of emotions.  His song was a high point musically and dramatically.<br>The musical aspects far exceeded my expectations!  Several of the songs will no doubt become top hits and I have no doubt this will become a staple for High School and College musicals.  There is true musical talent in this music and even the coldest hearts will melt and shed tears.  This movie is fun, touching and offers a human connection to the Bible‚Äôs greatest event.  Suitable for all audiences!"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2024-06-29,"As an atheist (non-believer) in God/Jesus, I heard a clip of the song We Become We and absolutely fell in LOVE with it."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-22,"As a Christian who loves Musicals like this, I can&#39;t wait to watch this masterpiece! Amen! üôèüèª"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-22,"First time I wanna see a Religious movie... Sound so fresh, Joyful, Enjoyable, Musical, Well produce..<br> And I just watched a few Shorts üòäüòäüòá"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2024-02-29,Watched it last night...didnt think I&#39;d like it..but I sure did.<br>I watched it as if I was with the grandkids.  Through a childs eyes. I loved it!! üòÇ‚ù§
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-13,"You know, sometimes, you need a good Biblical Epic to shake things up a bit to add a little more variety into the list of movies being released into the cinema these days. The fact that it&#39;s a musical AND has Antonio Banderas staring as the villain, consider me already buying my ticket and watching it Opening Weekend. I&#39;m in, I just love musicals."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-21,"Hoping that this is good. We need more quality, well written Christian films in the world."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-22,I just watched this the other night..and it&#39;s one of the best musicals I&#39;ve seen..I laughed..I cried..what an exciting way to tell the story of the birth of Jesus...my king! It&#39;s amazing!!
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-28,"I hosted a pre-screening of this film and will happily pay to go see it again! The music was so enjoyable, the comedic moments were really funny, and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; was delightfully re-told in a musical format.  Cast and characters (Fig the Donkey!!) were outstanding! Vocals were strong.  Choreography was authentic.  As a music educator, the most beautiful musical moment for me was when the shepherd girl sang &quot;Silent Night.&quot;  Do not miss this movie!!  Take your entire family! Ask your church to rent a theatre for a showing.  It was really well done.  Tutti Bravi, Affirm Films!!"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-26,"We saw it in the theater tonight &amp; my 3 teens, 12, 17, 18, loved it!  My husband &amp; I did too. We have 3 musicians in the family &amp; their standards are high. The whole thing reiterates how regular people can be used greatly by God if we listen &amp; obey, despite our normal fears. A very Biblical message! Believable, realistic, inspiring characters.<br>The acting, scenes, &amp; (even) the singing was wow! Dramatic enough but never overdone, very fitting and touching- and nothing was cringe or Broadway. I was so surprised. I normally don&#39;t like most musicals unless they are exceptional! I&#39;m buying the movie &amp; soundtrack immediately!<br>It will be on many more times before Christmas in our house hopefully and then added to our family Christmas traditions each year."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2024-01-31,Thank you all that were involved in making this movie. It is wonderful. The acting and singing is moving. I bought the DVD and have watched it 3 times. I never thought how much Mary and Joseph went through in her pregnancy. Can you imagine being 9 months pregnant and making the journey to Bethlehem. Love this movie.
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-11,"Just got back from seeing it with my family! It was INCREDIBLE!!!! I loved every single character and song and every time a song ended I felt like I had to clap for a live performance! It was simply amazing and well cast and I laughed and even cried and got chills. It has been a long time since I felt myself glued to a movie screen. I want to see it again, my whole family does and we gifted tickets at the end as well because it was great family entertainment."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-18,"Seeing this in theaters. My favorite songs are &quot;O Come O Come Emmanuel&quot;, &quot;Mary Mary Mary&quot;, &quot;Celebrate This Brand New Life&quot;, and &quot;It&#39;s Hard To Have Faith&quot;. I am hoping to purchase my meet and greet tickets for Darren&#39;s Christmas concert so I can tell Darren about this amazing movie!"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-10,"Fresh, creative take on the biblical story that is definitely worth experiencing!  Well crafted, sung, danced, acted, costumed, set, directed, and performed.  Fun and yet emotionally impactful."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-27,PLEASE MORE OF THIS KIND OF MOVIES!! I SO BADLY WANT THE REVELATION TO BE ADAPTED INTO A MOVIEEE
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-27,"I guess it would be easy to say how one could tell the most familiar story ever, in a new way.  But they have succeeded in this movie.  It was entertaining, fun, interesting, and a joy to watch."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-14,"This movie is exactly what it is, a movie, it&#39;s not relevant, and to that pastor who made a comment on how wonderful this movie is he should know that it goes against what he should have read. Movies like this take the Word and change it and put words and actions where they don&#39;t go. Tell me where any of this was written, maybe a couple of parts but small parts. Aweful."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2024-05-19,My mom and I just finished watching JTB and we loved it! It‚Äôs like a live action version of The Star(which we also love)!

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-13,"How can one believe the comments when there isnt even one criticism or negative word?  I think the subject matter of sin, redemption, incarnation and the violent rejection of the world from killing baby boys in Bethlehem to the Cross deserves more humble reverance than clapping, snapping fingers and wanting to dance"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-11,"It was soooo good! Creative liberties taken as a musical and dramatizations , yet true to the story of our Saviors birth."

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-13,The story has been told in this fashion many years ago in a book and play called &quot;Two From Galilee&quot;.  Our church has been performing the play for over 20 years.

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-25,"I searched for this preview after seeing the trailer play before the Barbie movie. May God bless this movie, and many see it, especially our children, in Jesus&#39; mighty name. This is what our world needs today for our children to know the truth. The creator, our savior! Who they are and whom they belong to. Our children and young adults have no identity. <br><br>(Deuteronomy 11:19) Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up."
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-22,"Wow, I just saw Milo in Journey to Bethlehem earlier and now I see this. I enjoyed the movie btw"

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-09-21,"I&#39;m a Lutheran Christian, and I might see this when it comes out. Been a while since I&#39;ve seen an interesting religious movie. The cast looks good and it does capture the feeling of the Nativity story. It also does look better than the animated movie &quot;The Star&quot;."

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-11-09,"God is Good and Jesus is Lord! Thank you Jesus for this, I&#39;m definitely watching it. Glad Antonio Banderas is in the movie"

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-10-12,Luke 2:8‚Äì16 the musical!
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-26,"A true masterpiece that I&#39;ve seen twice already and one that I&#39;ll look forward to re-watching every Christmas from now on! What&#39;s not to like about it? It has everything - a great cast, great cinematography and a terrific soundtrack to boot with every song a winner in my opinion! If you&#39;ve not seen it, what are you waiting for?! If you have seen it, go watch it again LOL! This film truly deserves the same meteoric success as &#39;The Greatest Showman&#39; and as a personal plea to the film makers, could you please release the song instrumentals for people to cover and spread the word including myself! :-)"
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-10,"Just a few adjustments: in the actual version, Mary hasn&#39;t met the man to whom she was to marry; Joseph was an old man, a widower, who already had some children from the previous marriage; Mary was a virgin to the mind as she was to the body; there was no wedding, just a hidden engagement ceremony, because the family was ashamed of her pregnancy. <br>The rest of the aspects in this movie...okay, let&#39;s make everything American funny, but deep down I feel this movie is mocking the whole image of who Jesus is and of who Mary is and of how Christ&#39;s coming into the world actually sanctified every being.<br>But it&#39;s just an opinion, so don&#39;t feel attacked by it, we all have different opinions and freedom of speech. Thank you!"

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-26,"a bit disappointed with some parts. 1. the Angels should be singing &quot;Gloria en Exelsis Deo.&quot; Not Silent Night, Holy Night.  2. Gabriel Not greeted Mary with &quot;Hail, full of grace&quot;   3. Gabriel did not explained to Joseph, why he should not leave Mary."

Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-12-09,Alright guys no spoilers! I don&#39;t want to know how it ends!
Journey to Bethlehem,EFXcEWalXBI,2023-10-26,I am intrigued with it being a musical it‚Äôs giving greatest showman quality ü§ûü§© watching for sure
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-02,"I watched the documentary at a film festival in Nairobi almost 10 years ago, when they finally scored there were cheers around the theatre like it was a live match, will never forget it"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,"Taika Waitit needs to do more projects like this, more indie projects instead of big studio controlled franchise"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-29,1. Glad to see Taika back<br>2. This will be the first time I see Michael doing a comedy role and not a villain üòÇ
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,"Michael Fassbender is back, baby!"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-11-07,My husband and I were able to see this tonight. They called it an unseen movie. It was worth watching. We loved it. I would watch it again. It was entertaining and kept me excited. Put it this way I wanted to kick the ball around.
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,This looks like a fun movie and really glad to see Michael Fassbender in the movies again
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,"Taika Waititi, who literally won an Oscar for JoJo Rabbit, deciding to list himself as &quot;Loser of Best Picture for JoJo Rabbit&quot;<br>is PRICELESS"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-28,"I&#39;m literally so excited for this, I&#39;m from American Samoa,it&#39;s nice to see a little representation for my country"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,"This seems to have a similar feel to it as Hunt For The Wilder-people which I really like. The further Taika gets away from love and thunder, the better."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-28,So glad to see the Michael Fassbender comeback... idc if this was filmed a few years ago it still counts and he&#39;s due a return
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,big shoutout to taika waititi for shining the light to our island! Samoa to the world!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-01,"The documentary is also amazing. Yes, this is a true story! The coach actually played with the best players in the world at his time."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-10-29,I wonder how many of the 3.8M views are from people rewatching the trailer lol. This is one of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen.
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-03-29,It was a freaking good movie! Extremely funny and lighthearted. Loved it!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-03,"Fassbender is the man, great to see him back. My fave actor"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-01-16,"Got dragged to this by my soccer obsessed 9 year old and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! Showcases how beautiful the pacific island culture is and their unique sense of humour. Definitely worth a watch and it‚Äôs not a sports movie as such, that‚Äôs just the glue that sort of binds the whole story together."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-29,"Anything Taika does I‚Äôm in, throw in Rhys, Arnett, Fassbender, etc‚Ä¶ looks great."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,"So in love with Taika and Fass, that I&#39;ve almost burst into tears"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-03,"That has to be the best team meeting presentation I&#39;ve ever seen. Short, no fussing about, few words, the point come across super clear"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,my love for Jojo Rabbit still hasn&#39;t subsided
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-12-05,"Just watched the film, it‚Äôs honestly so so good, I feel like it‚Äôs catered more to NZ, AUS and island nations which is why it might have low scores on the internet but if your from any of these country‚Äôs it‚Äôll probably be a 9 or 10/10"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-18,America Samoan where I was born and raise omg I‚Äôm so excited to watch this with my family üôåüèΩ
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-09-12,Now this is the Taika Waititi we know and love! He needs to be left alone to do passion projects!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,Yeah this is where Taika belongs. He excels at smaller films than big franchise projects. I&#39;d probably check it out. Been a long time since we&#39;ve seen Fasbender
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-28,"So cool seeing Michael Fassbender doing more comedic roles, the guy has a wild range"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-02,"Michael Fassbender in a Taika Waititi movie? Yes, please!"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,This is Taika in his element. This is where he can do his best!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-04-08,"The movie is funny and entertaining. I love watching Michael Fassbender. And some of the actors who played as the players are easy on the eyes, especially Uli Latukefu (as Nicky) and Ioane Goodhue (as Smiley)."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-28,Shout out to FASSBENDER Dont see this Great actor in much anymore nice to see him.

Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,"Taika and Micheal I‚Äôm literally so happy, I‚Äôve been waiting for months and I‚Äôm just so excited!"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,"If you have seen the documentary, you&#39;ll know how this movie plays out..but if you know Taika then prepare for a gut wrenching comedy drama"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,This trailer alone warms my heart. Can&#39;t wait for the whole movie! üíï

Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-28,"Love to see Waititi go back to his roots. I will watch anything this man creates, whether it&#39;s a dark comedy film or some random Japanese commercial."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,Perfect Taika is coming back to his roots and he Plays priest again hahah great Fassbender I cannot wait to see this
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,I&#39;ve been waiting for the next taika movie for so long I&#39;m so excited
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-29,Looks funny. Good to see Michael FASSBENDER back. It‚Äôs a shame we haven‚Äôt got to see a lot of him in the last few years. He‚Äôs a fantastic actor
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,FINALLY!!! Been waiting for this like for 3 years. Looks as great as I expected a Taika film to be
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-14,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRH5u5lpArQ&amp;t=86"">1:26</a> absolutely kills me ü§£ I‚Äôd go and see this film for that bit alone"
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-11-18,The documentary is one of my favorite films.  I bought a bunch of copies and literally handed them out to people.
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-02,"It‚Äôs been too damn long since we‚Äôve seen Michael Fassbender, easily become one of my fav actors, he excels at roles even in shit films. Him and James McAvoy singlehandedly carried the young X-Men movies. Glad to see him doing comedy again too, and he‚Äôs even playing a dude from my country, though he def just has an Irish accent lol. I mean Fassbender can act opposite himself and be entertaining I can‚Äôt wait to see him in this and The Killer."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-02-23,Literally my new FAVORITE underdog sports movie!!!<br>Taika‚Äôs BEST film!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-12-29,I just finished watching this at the cinema and I can say it‚Äôs surprisingly good. Something of fresh air from the trash they put out these days. <br>A definite must watch if you‚Äôre bored of everything else. Also don‚Äôt worry so much about the football theme if you‚Äôre not into that. It‚Äôs very light hearted and a bit of fun. 7.5/10üòä
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,"So this film is like a Reverse Ted Lasso in almost every way, but hopefully on Waititi&#39;s hand it is going to be just as much fun. Really enjoyed the trailer. Fingers crossed."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-08-18,I was an extra in this film! the posters were looking for &quot;african americans or polynesians&quot; Im both! haha it was so cool
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-05,Even the trailer is screaming taika waititi lol i love this man
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-23,I still believe he is the homelander  we deserved üòÇ
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-04-20,"Just saw this yesterday. Spoilers if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet.<br><br>One thing I thought was very well done, was how the daughter‚Äôs death wasn‚Äôt revealed until almost the end. Personally, I did not pick up at all that the daughter had died but once they reveal it, it makes total sense. The whole time you‚Äôre watching Fassbender‚Äôs character listen to the voicemails you assume that he has s strained relationship with the daughter because of the divorce, which they do blatantly bring up early in the film. At the end when he breaks down and tells the team how she died it really hits all the more. Personally, I think that was masterfully done."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-02-23,They should make more films about football it‚Äôs the best sport
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,Everyone go watch the documentary this is based on! It is quite great. Can&#39;t wait for this!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-08-04,Fassbender doing a Taika movie and a Fincher movie in the same year!<br><br>Talk about tonal whiplash üòÖ

Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-02,"I remember seeing the original documentary (which is brilliant in itself), cool to see they&#39;re doing a feature film with a good cast/director on it! Look forward to it."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-05-03,Good new Michael Fassbender is back <br>I tought about him not longtime ago <br>Miss him so much
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,Looks great! Loved Jojo Rabbit and am very glad to see Fassbender back in what appears to be good movies again between this and The Killer!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-03-27,bro this looks hella fun

Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-26,Looks like another win for Taika Waititi!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2024-01-19,this was so good i cried multiple times
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-09-13,"Great to see Michael Fassbender in movies again, looking forward to seeing him in this film and David Fincher&#39;s new film &quot;The Killer&quot;, which got rave reviews at Venice."
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-30,I highly recommend the documentary of the same name that this is based on. Incredible story
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-08-12,Just saw the trailer for this in my local Indie theater. I have never laughed so much during a trailer.  Cannot wait to see the film!
Next Goal Wins,pRH5u5lpArQ,2023-04-27,It is legitimately unsettling seeing Michael Fassbender with a full beard

Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2025-02-01,"Meeting Jason Statham has always been a dream of mine. His authenticity, humility, and immense talent have inspired me ever since I first witnessed his unforgettable performance in The Transporter 25 years ago. More than just an extraordinary actor, Jason has profoundly influenced both my personal growth and creative journey."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-03,Statham is actually quite good at comedy. He stole every scene he was in in Spy. We all know he&#39;s a badass action star. This looks like a home run of a film
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-14,I&#39;ll never get tired of jason statham in action movies
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-19,Guy Ritchie is by far the best British movie producer. Every film is a must watch
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,Jason Statham and Aubrey Plaza&#39;s sense of humor is a perfect match
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-10,"Just seen the movie, as expected Guy Ritchie never disappoints. Hugh Grant plays a brilliant character brilliantly."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,"Jason Statham, Aubrey Plaza, Cary Elwes, Hugh Grant AND Josh Hartnett all in a movie directed by Guy Ritchie? I am absolutely in for it, please and thank you."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-07,I must admit I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Aubrey and Jason sold the ticket as they are both favorites of mine. Jason did exactly as expected and  gave his solid  action movie performance. I expected it and got it. I have been a fan  of  Aubrey Plaza  for years and always thought she was  being cast just for her  ability to  sell awkward. After &quot;Emily the  Criminal&quot; I knew she was  breaking out of the  mold she had been cast into. Congrats Aubrey! I hope this  pairing can  continue  with a &quot;Mission Improbable&quot; series. I enjoyed  my time at the  theater and they sold some Popcorn and a  drink along with the ticket. This is how it is supposed to be for movies to  survive!
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-17,So good to see Josh Hartnett doing movies again.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-14,This movie was really a breath of fresh air. Loved the dynamic between all the actors and especially the humor between Plaza and Statham. I really enjoyed it!
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-13,Nice to know this movie&#39;s still coming out.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-19,Jason Statham one of the best actor in the world... Born to make history with an action... ‚ù§Ô∏èAll the way from indiaüáÆüá≥

Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-13,"By far Hugh Grant was the star of this movie with his amazing acting skills, just like in The Gentlemen the character he plays is devious and yet funny, as for the other actors they pretty much play themselves in an action role."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,I never get tired of Aubrey Plaza
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-03,"I saw this yesterday after not hearing about it at all. No spoilers, just wanted to say the movie was very fun and worth the watch, definitely recommend to anybody thinking about seeing it!"

Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-06,Aubrey Plaza is everywhere lately ... and I am loving it!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-11,Seriously Hugh Grant playing this type of character is just brilliant. I much prefer him like this than in more serious roles. Huge difference from Notting Hill character to this.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-07,"This has written Jason Statham all over it! Jason, please keep on making movies man. we love you, brother!"
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,Anything directed by Guy Ritchie will become iconicüéâ
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-04-14,This movie was pure entertainment and deserves a sequel.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-07-17,"I love the chemistry between Hugh Grant and Josh Harnett, they should do a full-on comedy film lol. Aubrey and Jason are also fun to watch."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-11,"Is it just me that thinks Jason, Abrey and Bugzy having a poker face in the entire movie?"
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-14,Since her success in White Lotus I have this feeling we are going to be seeing an awful lot more of Aubrey. Good for her being discovered so young.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-12,Hugh grants really changed his acting style and I really like it. He‚Äôs coming out the wood work with all kinds of eccentric and cockney characters I would never of believed he could accomplish. Bravo sir bravo üëè
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,My eyes damn near popped out of my head when Josh Hartnett appeared. So good to see his face again
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-19,Jason Statham &amp; Lion&#39;s gate has always been a real masterpiece movies  &amp; a good partnership too they always rocks with their action movies
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-20,I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever tire of Hugh Grant&#39;s new style I dig it alot
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-02,I&#39;ll never get tired of Jason Statham in action moviesü§©ü§©

Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-21,Enough of Jason statham kicking punching choking firing of dummies <br>He needs another tough guy as villain

Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,"I have followed Aubrey Plaza&#39;s career for a long time, and I have learned to expect her to do something that I wouldn&#39;t expect, but this is certainly something I did not in fact expect."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-19,"Even the trailer is so Guy Ritchie!! And it&#39;s cool to know that even though he&#39;s doing something serious with The Covenant, he will never stop making this style of action/comedy/gangster movies!!"
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-16,This looks like fun.  Josh Hartnett AND Cary Elwes making movies TOGETHER.  Aubrey is always good to look at on screen.
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-03-11,"Saw it high afüåø and will give it a 10/10!!! It had the James bond espionage vibe going on along with the Archer quips/ humor of the secret spies all bantering with one another. It may not be for everyone, but I will argue it will be a cult classic to those who are open-minded or love the spy genre. ü§µüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,WdZ-BWWQcWQ,2023-02-18,"Hugh Grant playing the same exact  character he played in the last Guy Ritchie film, I respect it"

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,"In a movie with a cast featuring Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, everyone is excited to see Tobey Maguire. Goes to show just how influential he was."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-29,"Tobey Maguire finally ended his break from acting, he‚Äôs such a phenomenally expressive actor. So glad that he‚Äôs back."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2024-08-13,"Everyone hates on this film‚Ä¶ yet anyone who‚Äôs TRULY spent time in ‚Äúthe business‚Äù knows this is absolutely an accurate portrayal of it. The washed up actor, the junkie out-of-her-mind starlet, the monotony and tediousness of being on a movie set. Babylon highlights THE REALITY of showbiz, while at the same time, still alluring the audience to crave its flaws for the pros outweigh the cons. That‚Äôs showbiz, kid!"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Nice to see Tobey Maguire in new movies
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-30,Seeing the love for Tobey Maguire in the comments makes me so happy
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-03-28,This is actually one of the best films of the year . Don‚Äôt let the Rotten tomato scores deter you . A masterpiece.  Pretty much excellence I‚Äôm every category
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-01,Happy to see Tobey again after long time... hope in future we will see more Tobey&#39;s movie and as a lead role
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Tobey Maguire is UNLEASHED in this film. So glad he‚Äôs getting roles like this again!
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-01-06,"If you are hesitating to see this movie bc of the mixed reviews or the runtime or bc avatar is out, i IMPLORE you to go watch this movie. Seeing it in theatres was genuinely the greatest cinematic experience of my life. I&#39;ve NEVER gone to see a movie a second time in theatres, but im on my 3rd viewing of this masterpiece."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-01,"After No Way Home, I&#39;m so glad Tobey is finally getting back the luxurious recognition he deserves!"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-30,"Everybody&#39;s focused on the actors but it&#39;s great to see Damian Chazelle coming back directing another movie! LaLa Land, Whiplash, and now Babylon. High expectations for this one for sure."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-02-01,"Enjoyed it.<br>The cinematography and production design are top notch.<br>Margot robbie and Diego calva are excellent and have genuine chemistry between them, and deliver performances that are funny and entertaining as well as disturbing and heartbreaking.<br>The pairing of Chazelle and Hurwitz is just spectacular everytime. The sound design and score were immense.<br>I liked the movie even though it had some faults. The runtime was way too long."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Brad Pitt is gonna win academy award for best supporting actor again

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,I don&#39;t know why Tobey appears so little in the releases. He looks amazing in the trailers
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-03-06,This movie is a cinematic masterpiece! The experience of watching this in a movie theater is indescribable- Several bows! üëèüèæü§Ø
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-09,Casting Samara Weaving in the same movie as Margot Robbie is definitely for a major part of the plot.
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-02,I‚Äôm happy tobey Maguire is getting the love he deserves. Welcome back Peter
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-03-25,"This movie was Perfection at it&#39;s best!! I love how it tells us about how Actors, musician, directors etc etc had to go through alot of obstacles in making a film or say to stand out in the film fraternity...Audience or film fans enjoy all the entertainment without realising the dark side of film..We think film makers and stars are happiest but in reality they are all like us any other human being trying to survive....It&#39;s a beautiful movie..."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,"This movie seems like Once Upon A Time In Hollywood meets The Wolf of Wall Street 3 hour crazyness. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m all for it. Might be a great crazy party movie to watch with friends and get drunk together üòÇ"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-19,"I think what makes Tobey for such a memorable actor is, like the silent movie stars of that area, he&#39;s an extremely expressive and caricature actor. He&#39;s not the best for melodramas but when given a cartoonish or grotasque type performence he shines. A quality he shares with johnny depp. I&#39;m so glad that finally a director recognizes that quality"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-01-02,"i don&#39;t think the trailer does this movie any justice. after watching it, i know it&#39;s hard to encapsulate in a trailer but man, this just makes it look like a chaotic comedy but it&#39;s so much bigger than that"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,"I worked on &quot;Babylon&quot; for 4 days. The best job of my life and 1 of the best days+experiences of my life. This film was my most anticipated media project of the decade so far (before worked on it) and &quot;La La Land&quot; is my favorite film, so this job was a full circle experience. A dream come true and once in a lifetime experience that I&#39;ll never forget. Can&#39;t wait for all of you to see it!"
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-30,This movie is giving me Once Upon A Time In Hollywood vibes
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-03-13,I&#39;m so upset that this masterpiece was not even nominated for Best Picture this year!

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-01-24,"Just watched it yesterday and i friggen loved it. It felt like a love letter to cinema, we are privileged to live in the same era as Damien Chazelle."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,I hope Margot Robbie wins an Oscar.
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,This movie looks great. Robbie And Pitt look like they&#39;re going to be oscar nominations. Love Damien and excited for this. Also glad to see Tobey making a comeback to Hollywood and hope they make Raimi&#39;s Spider Man 4.
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-01-22,That last scene showcasing the myriad of cinema knocked me out for about an hour

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2025-01-01,A movie like this should be 3 hour long. Those who talk about the runtime have zero knowledge of movies &amp; screenplay. <br>Loved this movie it was amazing

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Margot Robbie is giving a surreal and sensual performance. Amazing! Worth every accolade.

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-30,What a fitting name for a true story of Hollywood.
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Tobey Maguire is definitely the main antagonist
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-28,Yes we are excited that Tobey is back but don&#39;t forget the leads of the movie namely Margot Robbie and Diego Calva
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-12-31,"The movie is great great great. I am not saying it&#39;s a bad trailer in general. But, it&#39;s a very crapy trailer that makes the movie look like the journey of Margot to stardom and then failure. the movie is a hundred times more than that."
Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2022-11-29,"Margot Robbie role in this movie will be fantastic, definitely going to watch this in a theatre"

Babylon,5muQK7CuFtY,2023-01-27,"Oh my god it was truly amazing!!!  It‚Äôs the best film I‚Äôve ever seen. Truly genius. At the end I was in tears and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. My hb was equally gobsmacked. We were stunned. We can‚Äôt believe it didn‚Äôt do well in America but then that says it all I suppose. It‚Äôs got to be seen in cinema because it‚Äôs like being Tango‚Äôd. Marvellous, funny, tragic. I fell in love with the characters that‚Äôs the key eh. I still feel for them now. It should have won tonnes of Oscars. <br><br>Bravo üéâ"

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-16,I do hope we bring back this kind of movie genre. It&#39;s giving 90s Rom-Com and I&#39;m here for it.
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-04-08,"I&#39;m so happy that Sam is getting a leading role in the US. He is so incredibly talented and, of course, gorgeous! ü•∞"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-07-17,"I don&#39;t understand why the critics approached this film with such cynical reviews. It&#39;s exactly what it means to be, a lovely romantic comedy and that&#39;s a good thing! This film is a breath of fresh air with its sweet story in today&#39;s cinematic world. The leads are fantastic and the supporting characters are as well. Celine&#39;s performance was incredible, too. I really enjoyed the story unfolding, the journey of the chararcters and the happy outcome. &lt;3 I&#39;m definitely watching it again."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,Priyanka chopra is lead of the movie. She as an actress is amazing and finally the credit she deserve as an actress. I am so proud of her‚ù§Ô∏è
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,"2000 is the year I&#39;ve seen Priyanka for the first time and 2001 is the year I first watched her acting in Tamil language.. She has grown so much as an actress and achieved a level only one or two could dream.. I absolutely adore her and her personality. Love the way she talks and carries herself. Definitely someone who&#39;s worthy to look upto.. I wish nothing but best wishes to the whole team, this looks awesome.."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,"As an Indian who grew up watching Priyanka and also a huge Outlander fan, I‚Äôm so excited to watch PC and Sam on screen together, and it looks like a funny and heartwarming movie, and new music from Celine and that cameo from Nick?!? üòÇüòÇ SOLD ü§©üòç"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-05-13,"I love love this movie!! Who doesn‚Äôt need a reminder of what love feels like, how it comes in chaotic waves and how we wouldn‚Äôt trade a second of it even if we knew in advance its tragic or painful end. The movie is corny by the truck load. Celina Dion is so funny and we learn about her love for her husband. The subtle hints of caterpillars and butterflies signify transition, transference and metamorphosis. Can you fall in love with someone you‚Äôve never met? That‚Äôs an experience I wish for everyone. Love was never meant to make sense. Makes us crazy yet we all want it and need it ü¶ã"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-05-15,"I saw it yesterday and I really liked it. It was everything: romantic, dreamy, funny and emotional. Also Celine Dion is so sweet when she tells about her real love story with her husband...and her music, her powerful voice...simply perfect  ‚ù§"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,My favorite part of the trailer is when PC is going down that stairs in her yellow dress as Sam is looking at her while Celine&#39;s song plays in the background. Why do I feel like this is a Christmas movie. It&#39;s so heart-warming.
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,"Seriously, why is no one talking about how stupid jealous we are of Sam Heughan for having so many scenes with Celine Dion.  They looked like friends!  If he&#39;s actually a huge fan of hers, he has suddenly become the most eligible bachelor in the world!"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,How can I ignore the Outlander&#39;s Heartbeat The Sam Heughan and The Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-03-13,"After my breakup I was so devastated, it took me years to come out of this. Five years I stay single after breakup  and Finally I fall for someone again. Love comes again and we should Believe on it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,Priyanka Sam and Celine what a perfect gift
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,"Priyanka Chopra puts in her entire self into any roles she plays, she can mould herself amazingly well! Glad to see her in the lead role!! Bring it on, PC! Loved to see Nick&#39;s cameo as her date night! üòçüòç"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,"Celine Dion üëë and a wonderful cast! So beautiful to see Celine - one of the greatest singers of all time - featured in this new film! She‚Äôs an icon and deserves so much love, especially with all she‚Äôs faced over the past few years with the loss of her beloved husband and her own health issues. We get new Celine music too! üíïü§© Celine‚Äôs brand has always been ‚Äúlove conquers all‚Äù with romantic and uplifting music, and I‚Äôm thrilled to see her in the limelight again! Keep going, Celine Dion! You‚Äôre truly one of a kind."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-05-08,"Just went to see this film and really enjoyed the movie.  Sam was wonderful, I thought the actors portrayed a touching story of a love and change discovered in opening up to each other.  Celine Dion was an important link between these 2 characters and her sharing of her own love story gave it all more meaning.  Her music is beautiful but her love story means much more to the story this movie tells.  The movie was uplifting and a story I would want to see several times over."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-09-20,"Priyanka Chopra is soooo talented...what a acting,Soo natural and so real‚ù§"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,"I&#39;m not typically into romantic comedies - more of a horror, thriller, crime/drama guy - but this pulled me in from the first second. Everything here looks on-point, from the casting to the music to the inclusion of Queen Celine, who is LONG overdue for a movie role. This is absolutely something I would see. Nice to see a woman of color as a romantic leading lady."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,This is a remake of a German movie called ‚ÄúSMS f√ºr dich‚Äù (SMS for you) which was adopted from a book with the same name. Loved the original movie in German and definitely looking forward to this remake. Loving the chemistry between Priyanka and Sam!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-14,Priyanka Chopra is really a global icon and she‚Äôs proved yet again ‚ù§
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-17,"First off, I love the trailer! it looks cheesy for sure, but still very fun and romantic! Secondly, given the state of theatrical rom-coms these days, I&#39;m genuinely impressed that this trailer has already racked up nearly 10 million views in 2 days. Maybe it&#39;s Celine Dion, maybe it&#39;s Priyanka Chopra, but whatever it is, it&#39;s exciting! I&#39;m rooting for this movie to succeed!"
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-04-26,A You&#39;ve Got Mail type movie with Celine Dion music? I&#39;ll take it! And that part at the end made me chuckle.

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-05-19,"I found the piecing of the film so sophisticated ; from the work phone to the bar scene to the opera where they meet to tying in of Celine&#39;s relatable experience and the reality of Mira telling Rob that she&#39;ll never get over John despite moving on.

But Celine just has a way of making you feel good. When the piano interlude of &quot;It&#39;s all coming back to me now&quot;, one of my favorite Celine songs, started playing, there may have been some tears...because I was cutting onions in my bed...as one does. I will never believe in love, but Celine&#39;s songs make you believe &#39;maybe&#39;, even if only for a moment. Get well, Celine. Sending you warm wishes."

We spent the whole day with our guild chatting on discord and cheering him up. I remembered the day he told us he dated his late wife and 2 years later he married her and we were so happy for him because it&#39;s rare to see your own online friends happily talk about their relationship with their love ones since sometimes we get bored we just talk random things. Overtime we learned to know bits and bits about him and his wife, it felt like we knew her because she is always in the background laughing at us and making jokes on voice chat when he&#39;s out of the room. But now that it&#39;s so quiet without her around it&#39;s oddly quiet &amp; awkward to comfortably talk around in chat for a while. One of the girl in the guild was a longtime friend of ours since the beginning before he even dated &amp; marry. She end up comforting him and admiring all the things he talked about his late wife to us. Eventually they fall in love and married to this day, 4 years now. Sometimes you can find love again, sometimes even in a random place like this. True story lol ik it&#39;s unbelievable but it happened and I still couldn&#39;t beleive that the whole guild went through seeing such dramatic and emotional times in a game that you would not expect to see."

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,"It&#39;s so good to see Celine Dion in a movie. It just made me feel sad hearing her beautiful singing voice, knowing that she&#39;s not well and won&#39;t be able to sing, for now at least. She has an amazing presence on stage and I hope to see her one day in concert again."
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,Priyanka Chopra üëë Celina Dion üëë  Sam Heughan‚ù§superb cast!!! Can‚Äôt wait for the release date ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-15,The trailer is so good that it brings back the vibes of early romance movies of the 1990&#39;s ‚ù§Ô∏è
Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-17,"Omg I‚Äôm so excited for this! It has so many of my favorite actors &amp; singers!

Love Again,CQDXtD2HJAs,2023-02-16,"Priyanka is gorgeous, and Celine is a legend. Can&#39;t wait to see this.. even if the storyline is a little obvious."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Thank you A24. In a world of remakes, reboots, sequels, and just generally unoriginal films you stand as a beacon of hope for innovation."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"This is the sort of movies Hollywood should focus on.  Smaller budget, high concept stuff.  I&#39;m definitely interested."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Nic Cage is such a great actor. He just has to be in the right film.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-09,Love how the trailer slowly shifts into a thriller. Just gives a peak at how crazy the end concept is.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,"I don&#39;t think there&#39;s another actor in Hollywood who&#39;s even came close to the crazy genre range of Nicolas Cage. From blockbusters to indies, action to drama, biographics to comic book adaptations, popcorn movies to artistic ones. He literally starred in any possible genre many many times. When one day he&#39;s done with acting he&#39;ll leave an amazing movie resume absolutely impossible to catch up for any actor."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,People say originality is dead. It‚Äôs not. For major studios it‚Äôs dead but for smaller studios like A24 and NEON originality is still very much alive. I can‚Äôt wait for this! Such a fascinating concept!
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Does anyone else get filled with immense joy every time a Nic Cage trailer drops?!?!
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-16,"Saw it at the CIFF premiere this past weekend. Y‚Äôall have no idea how hysterical and insane this incredible film gets. Run, don‚Äôt walk, to the theater when it gets a wide release."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-22,"Pure joy to see Cage doing what he does best. Original, brilliantly balanced, multi genre roles. What an actor.  Thank you A24 üôèüèΩ"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Finally a movie with Nicholas Cage in people&#39;s dreams
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,This feels like one of those movies where it&#39;s all fun and games until the plot makes a 180 and becomes the most horrifying experience imaginable.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-14,"As a norwegian I am thrilled to see that Kristoffer Borgli is gaining international recognition. We have more directors than just Trier, you know."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"As someone who saw this movie, I can say that it‚Äôs one of my favorite movies of the year and only gets better"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-23,This is exactly the kind of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind early 2000&#39;s high-concept actor-driven movie I&#39;ve been missing for so long. Thank you A24.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,I‚Äôm so happy to see Cage back  in action in the spotlight. People don‚Äôt give him enough credit he‚Äôs absolutely brilliant
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-09,"A24 is really keeping the fun of filmmaking alive with everything they help produce, I‚Äôm so happy to see so many new and interesting ideas being made all the time. And to top it all off they‚Äôre all pretty great. Or at least I‚Äôve never seen one I disliked."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Saw this movie at the premiere. It‚Äôs bonkers, hilarious and insanely unique. An interesting critique on fame and cancel culture. <br>While waiting for the wide release, I highly recommend the director‚Äôs other film, Sick Of Myself. He‚Äôs really good at doing social commentary. <br>My biggest flex in life is that I got to watch a Nick Cage movie with Nick Cage in the same theatre lol. It felt very meta given the context of the film."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,He&#39;s been KILLING it in these strange roles the past couple of years! Dudes found his perfect archetype üòÇ
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,A24 is one of the few major studios still pushing out creative high concept work and it is paying off. Keep up the great work guys!
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-13,"Nic Cage has been my favorite actor since 1996 when I saw him in The Rock. There just isn&#39;t anyone quite like him. When he&#39;s with the right writer and director, it&#39;s a masterpiece."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,This looks fascinating.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Can&#39;t believe they&#39;re finally making a documentary on that time we all dreamt about Nicolas Cage &lt;3
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"I feel over the years cage has been given the opportunity to tweak and refine aspects of his acting ability so much it‚Äôs like every part he has ever done is been merged into one cohesive character to bring to life something new. He is an underrated actor that has put in the ground work doing all types of movies despite the criticism of good or bad. He is the epitome of what happens  when you just do you. It‚Äôs his perceive awkward nuances that over the years people have learnt to love. Rejecting the conventional Hollywood tropes and reaching deep into the parts of himself others dare not. Weather or not it looks good, bad, ugly doesn‚Äôt matter. He is reaching for something he deeply believes in and that‚Äôs what we come to appreciate and get behind. Thankyou cage üíê"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-25,"If you&#39;re someone who has vivid dreams, believe they means something and enjoy black mirror then you&#39;ll probably enjoy this movie. The thing i love about A24 is how deeply their movies make me think immediately afterwards. It&#39;s not a much watch in theatres but i really enjoyed it."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"This is actually based on a known phenomenon you can read about (tons of articles, even sites devoted to it) where countless people have seen the same man in their dreams over the years who always seems to be just observing. There&#39;s actually a sketch of the &quot;man&quot; people keep seeing, based on testimonies from the people who see him (which, oddly enough, looks like what they did with Cage&#39;s &quot;look&quot; in the film). It&#39;s likely just some psychological composite &quot;man&quot; that many people form in their heads that <b>seems</b> like the same person - but for a screenwriter to turn that into a story about an actual man being recognized as that person and his reaction to it, is a GREAT idea. I wish I&#39;d thought of it. lol"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-21,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3x9iUL-74w&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> convinced me I need to see this. Just imagining all the crazy, manic, drug trip Nic Cage moments we can get if his character is literally showing up in <b>DREAMS</b> fills me with all sorts of joy."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,"This is why people want to see films. This type of film is rarely made. Quirky, original, surprising and with actors playing relatable characters.<br><br><br>This looks great."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-29,As long as A24 keeps making movies like this I will continue to whole heartedly support them and spread the word about their movies.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,Cage has been absolutely killing it lately in these low-to-mid-budget indie movies. Really interested in this one.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-25,"Nicolas Cage is without a doubt a role model in art, he has done it all and keeps on doing it, performing beyond budget beyond fame and beyond necessity, to leave a legacy for people to look back and learn, it is definitely a reason to always push ourselves pass our comfort zone."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,<b>A24 hardly disappoints and this time they have The Cage with them to go all the way out ! Can&#39;t wait !</b> üî•
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3x9iUL-74w&amp;t=113"">1:53</a> that crazy movement; the erratic swinging of his arms with a giant smile on his face as he moves in to presumably kill... now THAT is something that I&#39;ve had nightmares about."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,This would be terrifying.<br><br>To have people see you and not know if they&#39;re dreaming eventually....<br>I am so in for this.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,"This man is a acting machine, pumping out 3 to 4 movies a year. Insane and still very enjoyable to watch. Can not wait to see this film."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"So glad im here for the resurgence of nic cage, i know he never left but to finally see him get more serious roles again is amazing, one of my favorite actors of all time. What a time to be alive!"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-10,"The reason I‚Äôm excited for this movie isn‚Äôt the actor or what may happen in it, but the phenomenon that it‚Äôs showing, to see someone you have never met in your dreams and then meet the same person is something I‚Äôve actually experienced and I‚Äôm happy a movie is doing it."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Nic Cage has evolved over the years to one of my favorite actors. I can‚Äôt recall ever being so amped about an actor, every film he does now gets me incredibly excited, something 20years ago I probably wouldn‚Äôt have imagined ever saying. <br><br>After his recent films like Pig, Mandy and The Color Of Space I know whatever project he is going to be a part of is going to be unique and well crafted, something I really appreciate these days. <br><br>A24 is by far my favorite studio, I don‚Äôt love every film they do but I always appreciate the fact that they are making and supporting films that they do. Like Cage their film are unique and extremely well crafted. <br><br>A24 + Cage really is a ‚ÄúDream Scenario‚Äù for me. üôå"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-23,"It‚Äôs great thing to see an artist truly being an artist, stretching his limits that is what an artist strives for, not the judgement of others."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Not only does A24 make superior movies, their trailers are phenomenal as well."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-01-02,This is one of the most refreshing movies Ive seen in years. It&#39;s dark humor is uncomfortably funny. People can be so unreasonable especially with what seems like its real.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-25,"Man, I‚Äôm loving that Cage is getting back to his old ways, this is the man I grew up watching, Con air is still one of my favorite movies."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,I am riddled with goosebumps. Nick Cage is the finest wine of Cinema.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Nic Cage is on a roll, whoever is getting him these roles is doing an excellent job + Julianne Nicholson is amazing"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-13,"I watched this at the weekend, and Kristoffer Borgli&#39;s other recent film, Sick Of Myself, earlier this year. They are both excellent and original works of cinema, definitely a director to watch."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Nicolas Cage has always been an icon. Action movies when I was a kid and later it was Wild At Heart and Red Rock West. Pig was genuinely the most moving film I‚Äôve seen in years and I highly recommend watching it if you haven‚Äôt seen it already. The Color Out Of Space is also good but if you want the more zany, b-movie Nic Cage."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"I think it&#39;s safe to say in a world of franchises filling the box offices, a24 is keeping movies alive"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-06,"happy for cage to be back in the spotlight. always been one of my top 10 favorite actors ever. even if some movies are mediocre, i still like him in them. he has got something special."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-30,"Absolutely amazing film. I normally don&#39;t comment, but the concept, acting, sound, direction, cinematography, pacing - everything was perfectly balanced and executed. First movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time that was REALLY original. The trailer only shows the first act (which is great and develops the concept), the second act was amazing, and just when I didn&#39;t know where it would go, the third act really brought it home. Truly great film, can&#39;t recommend it enough!"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-22,I remember hearing that was going to be an adaptation of a very similar creepy pasta to this and I believe this is that project and I‚Äôm very happy to see it isn‚Äôt just some generic horror film but a smaller independent studio projects with clearly a lot of creativity put into it
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-22,A24 is some of the best sources for indie films that are original and feel authentic. This is the first time Nick boards the ship and I&#39;m all here for it.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"To anyone who doesn&#39;t know, Borgli has previously directed the movie &quot;Sick of Myself&quot; and it is a blast! A perfect mix of satirical comedy and drama, I highly recommend it to everybody!"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-07-07,"I have found out that Michael Cera (Nick And Noarh:infinite Playlist), Alice Braga (I Am Legend) and Amber Midthunder (Prey) are also Co-starred opposite Nicolas Cage in this A2A movie. I have been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage for years now. One of his movies l love is The Rock"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,I don&#39;t know why but Bald Nicholas Cage is scary
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-21,"I always wait for every A24 trailer, they never disappoint to bring new and unique films"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-22,finally. a movie about my constant nicolas cage dreams.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-14,That one scene. My son could not stop quietly laughing and I was trying to so hard to hold it in as there were only two other people in the screening with us. Anyone who seen it will know which scene. The level of his talent of acting to make it feel serious and yet so awkward at the same time made it more funny
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Nic Cage is a true artist. I love that he&#39;s doing the wackiest of films these days and just having a good time.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,A24 has been such a blessing for cinema in the last several years.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,I&#39;m so happy for him. He really is getting some deserving roles. This is by far a great one üëç
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-06-24,"Absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. The supporting actors are entirely wonderful. It&#39;s always a joy to see Julianne Nicholson. She needs to be a much bigger star. I love this movie so much. It&#39;s been streaming on HBO and I watch it every day. Yes, I&#39;m  obsessed. Nic Cage couldn&#39;t be more perfect."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-20,"The problem with A24 is that they release these trailers and I want to watch them immediately and I can‚Äôtüò≠ Such a wonderful studio, always excited for their work!"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"A movie made with 35 mm (or any other type of film) set in this new decade is surely a great mix that I always wanted to see one day, you sense that this might be an old film but then you see stuff like phones or how people socialize or even the themes which are more prominent to these recent years that gives you this sense of confusion, but at the same time a feeling of fascination to see these two concepts intersect and combine, or well, at least for me. To me it&#39;s like saying &quot;this is weird, but in a good way&quot;."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,This looks fascinating. Thank you A24 for continuing to release creative films üëè
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-11,A24 killing it consistently on all levels. fantastic stuff.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-05,"Nicolas Cage is truly an incredible actor. Honestly, one of the greats, even if he hasn&#39;t done the best movies.<br><br>Even in this trailer alone, you can tell he has achieved a very compelling performance.<br><br>Actually looking forward to this one, finally looks like a good movie!"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"I&#39;ve been waiting for this concept to become a movie! Just imagined it to be more horror driven, but this works too"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,This is such a cool idea for a film üòé<br>Im looking forward to checking it out
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-12-01,"Saw it last night.  Definitely original.  Some will like it, some will not like it."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"I hope they give him an Oscar for that. Nic Cage played the most wonderful parts in the last years. Things most other actors would be afraid of. His renaissance is overdue, even Brendan Fraser had one (deserved)."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,This man really gets better the older he gets.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,nicholas cage is a gift to us all. üôèüèø
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-11-16,"Between this and Sympathy For the Devil, Nic Cage is staring in two incredibly unique, fascinating conceptual movies in a single year. He‚Äôs an absolute legend of an actor. You can tell he enjoys putting on such a unique show. And he definitely is not taking the pay check of those bloated Marvel movie actors where they just quip cheesy one liners and wave their hands in front of a green screen."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"Nic is on a roll  recently. Massive Talent, Pig, Renfield, Sympathy for the Devil and now this. All absolute banger performances."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-21,"This is such a unique plot like it‚Äôs so original and different, it‚Äôs nothing short of amazing to see. A24 is just in a league of its own right now"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"If this gets marketed properly, I can definitely see awards possibilities, especially for Cage, who looks INCREDIBLE in this."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-11-21,This movie has one of the most heartbreaking final lines in a movie
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-10-03,"A24 always pushing the edge of cinema, this looks absolutely brilliant."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,"A24 really can‚Äôt lose, the only films really worth seeing in theaters anymore"
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-23,One of the most talented actors of our time
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-02-08,Alice Braga is an exceptional actress. I saw her in hypnosis: invisible threat. Then I found the series Queen of the South and I loved it. I didn&#39;t imagine she was so good. Before I had only seen I am the legend

Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-28,"I already have an unhealthy obsession with anything Nicolas Cage, and him an an A24, which is arguably the best studio right now is just incredible. I literally have no choice but to stan."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-22,It&#39;s nice to see him in a film where he demonstrating nuance and personality rather than caricature and overwrought insanity. Going to watch!
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-12-31,"The nightmare starts when you wake up, but my dreams are catching up..."
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Whoever came out with this concept is a genius! It&#39;s different and I like something different from stuff we have today from Hollywood.
Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2023-09-19,Nic Cage is amazing ü§© He literally can play any role and absolutely kill it! We are so lucky to have watched his greatness on screen all these years. Thank you üôè

Dream Scenario,q3x9iUL-74w,2024-06-13,"Why is Nic such a great actor???? EVERY movie he is in bro entertains. He can even make you not notice that you&#39;re watching him on a smaller studio, and if this is what smaller studios do, then PLEASE MORE smaller studio movies!  üíØ"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"The fact that this is loosely based on Spielberg‚Äôs childhood, his love for film, and the divorce of his parents, it‚Äôs safe to say that we‚Äôre in for something incredibly special. By the looks of it, Michelle Williams could finally win an Oscar. Spielberg may finally win a second Best Picture Oscar. I‚Äôm grateful for Spielberg and everything he‚Äôs given to the world. This will be on repeat till I finally see it on the big screen."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-08-12,"Anyone who loves &amp; understands art, will see themselves in this film. Too many scenes just hit too close to home. So amazing."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-29,I saw this movie last night and I did not expect to be so profoundly affected by it.  I loved every single moment of it.  Every now and then I&#39;ll see a movie that&#39;ll reaffirm my faith in cinema and this is one of those films.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-06,This is sweet... I&#39;m 17 now and I&#39;ve been making short movies with my brother and friends for a while. I think this movie has been in Spielberg&#39;s mind for long
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-02-13,This movie is a gem. Visually beautiful and ethereal. I genuinely laughed and cried in many scenes. Will never forget this movie. Spielberg at his vintage best. Janusz Kaminski&#39;s cinematography took me to 1950s and 60s.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"‚ÄúYou cant just love something, you have to take care of it‚Äù this movie looks wonderful"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,You know the director hits peak when he starts telling his own story &amp; people are more interested in it than him. A gem Spielberg is.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-12,"My father-in-law was one of Stephen Spielberg‚Äôs childhood best friends growing up in Phoenix, AZ. He was even supposed to be in Stephen‚Äôs first film in HS before he moved to LA. I‚Äôm so excited for this film to come out finally. The trailer gave me chills. I can‚Äôt wait to see it!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-10-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1G2iLSzOe8&amp;t=113"">1:53</a> When Seth Rogen‚Äôs character said to Sam ‚ÄúIf you stop making movies, it will break your mother‚Äôs heart.‚Äù That really hit me hard because I‚Äôm a film student myself. Sometimes I feel like giving up filmmaking but I know now this is my purpose to inspire audiences to tell stories on screen. Never give up despite whatever obstacle gets in the way."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-07,As a kid who grew up on Spielberg films through the 80s/90s.. I‚Äôm so glad that he‚Äôs alive and well and still working on his craft and blessing us with new projects.  Looking forward to this one.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"When Michelle Williams asked him ‚Äúwhat was your favorite part?‚Äù I teared up a little. It reminds me back when I was a child going to the movies with my grandparents and being so stunned by the cinema experience and falling in love with film and the industry. Spielberg is one of the greatest visionaries of all time and can still pull at my heart strings. I know this one will be great, this comes off personal. When that can be captured through the lens- true passion. That‚Äôs when you know something special is on screen. Can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"as someone who looks up to steven spielberg and wants to be him when i grow up, i cannot wait for this film. been a fan since i was four years old. currently in my first year of film school and i&#39;m hoping to start filming my short film once i finish my first year. god, i love spielberg. the hype for the fabelmans is unreal. currently in tears.<br><br>update: just got home from watching the fabelmans and i&#39;m STILL crying. totally worth the watch."

The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-06,"This film was a deeply personal experience for me, so many parallels to my life and family. Tears and reflection kept me glued to the screen for every second of the film. Steven Speilberg is a master director. This film is absolutely beautiful."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-11,Does anyone else notice how incredible Spielberg is at using the magic enthusiasm that children bring to everyday life? The joy and wonder and all the Spontaneous creativity they just do by being kids.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,This film is based on Steven Spielberg‚Äôs childhood growing up. I‚Äôm definitely going to see it.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I cannot wait to see this!  Michelle Williams, the cinematic ‚Äúautobiography‚Äù of Steven Spielberg - directed and produced by the man himself - definitely a combination worthy of embracing."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-11-14,Steven Spielberg is an artistic genius and will always be the greatest film director for generations
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-15,"I remember when I fell in love with movies. When I saw the greatest showman in theaters for the first time I knew that I wanted to make movies. This trailer made me feel so emotional, because my mom would always tell me that I could never make a living out of making movies. I connect with this movie and I‚Äôm so excited to watch it."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-27,BEST  LINE  IN  THE  MOVIE  WAS :     &#39;&#39; YOU  DON&#39;T  OWE  ANYBODY  YOUR  LIFE &#39;&#39;  . . . . . . .   <br>  People had tears streaming down their faces in the movie theatre tonight !     Was a heart wrenching memorable moment ...!!!
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-12,"Was fortunate enough to see this film at the Toronto International Film Festival this past weekend, with Steven Spielberg himself there! I can confirm that the excitement I‚Äôm seeing in the comments is merited. I think this is Spielberg‚Äôs best film in many years, it‚Äôs absolutely incredible."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Spielberg is my favorite director of all time and I‚Äôm working up to meet him someday‚Ä¶ but something tells me this will hit right in the feels. Never stop being Spielberg, Mr. Spielberg."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"As an aspiring director, and a 2nd year film school student, it‚Äôs so inspiring seeing how far Spielberg has come - one of the best filmmakers of all time, and a true master of his craft. I absolutely cannot wait for this film! The trailer brought me to tears, and I had chills throughout."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-04-20,"Man‚Ä¶ a minute in and I was already crying‚Äî this one‚Äôs for those who‚Äôve been told their art‚Äôll never get anywhere, just look at where it brought Spielberg"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-11-26,"This is a film I can&#39;t describe. It makes me cry, it makes me happy, it mostly inspires me. It is certainly one of my favorites."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"anything spielberg directs, its gonna be a visual experience"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I just came back from the cinema having seen E.T on the big screen and it had me in tears.   I then watch this trailer, and I&#39;m in years again.   Thank you, Steven Spielberg!   I absolutely cannot wait!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-10-09,"Steven Spielberg must also be considered for nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  My mother would analyze Spielberg films as if they were literary works, among the greatest literary works and she would emphasize his use of fine literary techniques in film. The conscientiousness of Steven Spielberg films is a beautiful parallel to the endeavor of Alfred Nobel, and would also benefit the Nobel Prize in Literature forever.  His films have enriched humanity, and considered as literary works have shaped the heart of mankind unlike any previous work of art."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-15,Standing in my kitchen in Germany at 2:21am watching this and crying. I‚Äôm not sure a trailer has ever had that sort of impact. Bravo.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2024-10-26,"This movie was insanely good. So underrated.<br>I cried watching it, and now I just want to watch it again."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-13,"Being a filmmaking student and big fan of Spielberg, this movie is a real treat for me ‚ù§Ô∏èüéûÔ∏è"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Oh my goodness this looks incredible, I can&#39;t even imagine Steven Spielbergs feeling bringing this film to life his very own personal passion project based on his childhood Michelle Williams looks fantastic I bet steven saw his mother in her right away Paul Dano looks great Seth Rogan looks great this movie truly looks like a inspiration to anyone who wants to make movie&#39;s and how you should never let anyone tell you otherwise If you feel you can do it holy Jesus I can&#39;t wait to see this I&#39;ve watched this trailer like 20 times now"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Just the cinematography itself is a gem! This breaths love for cinema right from the trailer.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-11,"As I flipped thru radio stations in Charlotte at night on 11/10, I came across a talk show, intermittently pulsing static but enough to hear soothing voices. A woman was heard questioning a man who sounded like Jeff Bridges. As he spoke, he mentioned Saving Private Ryan and Schindler&#39;s list. I focused in on the dial knobs of the radio as I sat in line at Chic Fil A. I thought to myself &quot;no way this is Spielberg&quot; He continued to tell stories about his childhood in which old veterans of WW2 would congregate at his house, have lengthy conversations with each other and start balling out of nowhere. Yep, Spielberg. He mentioned The Fablemans and now I m here! Thanks Charlotte NPR!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-13,"I am almost in tears just watching this trailer.. I remember being 6 years old the first time my parents put a camera in my hand, looking through the viewfinder...I never looked at things the same way after that.. grade school was stop animation videos and kung fu shorts...high school was skate videos and documenting parties (it was known that I always had a camcorder in my backpack..a camcorder I &quot;borrowed&quot; from the media lab) Went to school for video production, did a few jobs here and there in a already saturated field.... my mother always encouraged my artistic side, my father was a welder and pressured me into getting a trade, which I did... followed in his footsteps and became a welder...did it for 18 years... and hated it, the great pay was the only thing that kept me doing it.. 3 months ago I quit welding to work in a pressing plant making records...half the pay from welding....and I love it, I&#39;m happy and I get to network with other musicians...and I feel like I have purpose...I still cut videos for my bands and friends bands...so life is still enjoyable.....going to see this movie opening night!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Brilliant trailer, I had quite an emotional reaction to it. Especially the end, transported me back to being a young child and after a movie my dad would ask what my favourite part was. And I&#39;d ask the same in return. This film will probably break me in the best way possible."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Having been fan of Spielberg my whole life I have to say this is going to be an Academy Award winner. This is needed. We need this movie. His passion for film, his love for the art. We all need to remember what it is that drives us. I want to watch this now."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Absolutely cannot wait to see this masterpiece unfold. Literal chills watching the trailer.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-11,"This kid film maker has all the right ideas for a massive YouTube career, then he gets demonetized and that breaks his heart. Yeah I can totally relate to this film. Lucky Spielberg made his films well before YouTube ever appeared."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-11-09,My best picture of 2022<br>One of the greatest movies of all time <br>Thank you Steven Spielberg and all crew rise and shine
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Just got out of this movie from TIFF. Another absolute masterpiece from Spielberg. You guys are not ready for the emotions
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-12,"I&#39;m just so happy for Paul Dano. The guy is a true believer in the power of a good performance, and he&#39;s finally getting roles in huge films. Good for him.<br><br>There Will Be Blood is my favorite film ever, and Paul&#39;s performance in it nearly matches the heights of Daniel Day-Lewis&#39;s. Go check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it already."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Michelle Williams is one of the best actress of her generation. She&#39;s a chameleon in many of her movies. She can really dissapeared into a role especially for a drama movie. As a fan of her work, I&#39;m so happy to finally see her in a Steven Spielberg movie. One of few actresses who deserves to win an Oscar atleast once in her career üôåüôå"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-13,They nailed it with the piano piece playing throughout. Representative of his mother and her omnipresence in his life. We are so lucky to have Spielberg‚Äôs movies.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Steven Spielberg es la raz√≥n por la cual muchos son directores HOY, solo ver el tr√°iler me ha hecho llorar; bienvenido su tercer Oscar como director. Gracias Maestro."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-27,"My friends and I, very spontaneously, went to watch this film today. I had never even heard about this film at all, we just saw the closest movie to our time and went for it<br><br>It was genuinely so surprising. Didn&#39;t even know it was from Spielberg until I bought my ticket. And knowing about his early life, seeing him retell it like this was really something. Absolutely loved it and so glad I watched it blind, Spielberg has done it again. This hit really close to my own life too. The child actors were also surprisingly so good and everything felt like I was actually watching an 80s film set in the 60s. Incredibly immersive and symbolic<br><br>8.8/10"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,This is based on Steven Spielberg&#39;s childhood but it seems like his tribute to cinema as what Martin Scorsese is to Hugo in paying tribute to cinema. This is cinema at its finest üôåüôå
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-18,"This movie will be inspiring to some who have a dream, painful to others who couldn&#39;t make it happen."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-12,I owe Spielberg my good taste in films and great childhood memories.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Just from this trailer you can tell this is going to be a very special movie, Spielberg&#39;s love letter to cinema itself, and to his family as well"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-12,"I&#39;ve been a Spielberg fan for a very long time. Jurassic Park was my first real gateway to his films, and since then it has been an everlasting obsession with his films. Steven was the reason I decided to attend film school for college, and to pursue a career in filmmaking. Though the work I do differs from cinema, I would love to do future work in storytelling. I think Spielberg was and still is a huge inspiration for filmmakers all around the world. The Fabelmans looks to be a companion piece to Super 8 with a filmmaker following his passions. I am beyond excited to see this when it hits theaters, and I dearly hope that this film brings some awards to both the cast and crew. Cannot wait"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I&#39;m in tears watching this trailer<br>I&#39;m a doctor from India, and even though i like my profession I&#39;ve never stopped thinking about being a film maker... A servant of cinema, in school was always fascinated about art.. and through the years, be it an art or craft or photography I realised that for me a cinematic experience is the ultimate form of art.. It is godly to me... But here I am.... Watching this trailer, thinking how family toxicity has woven its way in this trailer and my life"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-11,Who‚Äôs here after the Golden Globe wins for Best Motion Picture: Drama and Best Director for Steven Spielberg?
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-29,I guarantee I‚Äôm going to cry when I watch this. Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,finally Paul Dano coming back again üò≠ he is getting recognition he deserves
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"It feels like a direct inspiration from the childhood of Stephen Spielberg. His fascination with films, going to the theatre to see &quot;The Greatest show on earth&quot;, making films with his friends, etc. are nothing but his own life stories."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I absolutely cannot wait to see &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; this coming November, and it&#39;s wonderful to see Mr. Steven Spielberg&#39;s personal yet semi-autobiographical childhood in post-WWII Arizona, followed by his rise to become an aspiring filmmaker. Like Quentin Tarantino&#39;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; and Martin Scorsese&#39;s &quot;Hugo&quot;, or even Paolo Sorrentino&#39;s &quot;The Hand of God&quot;, &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; truly pays tribute to cinema, but in a Spielbergian wonder.<br><br>This movie is one of the most personal films that I strongly relate to because I want to be a film director one day, and knowing the fact that Steven Spielberg is the first well-known director that I discovered when I was a little kid. Can&#39;t wait to see more of this."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-18,"This brought tears to my eyes. I idolized Steven Spielberg growing up. With my friends we made short films and I wanted to be the next one. Went to college in San Francisco as a film major. Within my first semester, I was robbed 4 times. All of my films I made growing up were taking. I gave up on that dream and switched majors to business communications. A decade later, I went through my own divorce. Chased the bottle. Gave up on myself. Still have so many story ideas I would love to tell but no matter how much I pray for this passion to go away it haunts me everyday. Anyway, I cannot wait to see this. Looks like a perfect Thanksgiving release for a family to watch. Spielberg, if there‚Äôs any iota chance you may see this; thank you for not giving up on your dream. Your films have blessed so many around the world and for generations to come. Your dreams will last forever. Ty"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-10-08,"Can&#39;t wait to see this. My favorite filmmaker of all time, legendary Steven Spielberg!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"This is definitely going to to win Best Picture! You have Steven Spielberg directing, an all-star cast, beautiful visuals, incredible acting, and the ultimate tribute to cinema."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-12,"I&#39;m so damn excited for this movie. I haven&#39;t been this emotional from a trailer alone in such a long time. Beyond the gorgeous storytelling, score, and cinematography, I&#39;m excited to see him dive into aspects of growing up Jewish. When I was a kid, I always got sad seeing all the holiday lights up on people&#39;s houses and my parents wouldn&#39;t let us put them up because they were Christmas lights, they were not for Hanukkah, and I never thought it was a shared experience until seeing this also in the trailer. And as an aspiring filmmaker, I&#39;m so excited to see more about the life of one of my favorite directors. Ahhhh I just can&#39;t wait for this movie :)"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Only Steven Spielberg can make a drama movie feels like a suspense thriller. <br>Did in Lincoln , has done it in The Fabelmans"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-04,So it&#39;s a movie about Steven becoming a director? I LOVE IT!
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-01,What I love mostly about Spielberg is his way of emotionally conveying a story. Be it a blockbuster movie or an artistic one. He understand the emotional complexity of the characters and their arcs.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Spielberg not coming slow for that Oscar. As always the film looks great.<br>I just hope Paul Dano gets a nomination for an Oscar. I don&#39;t particularly care for the Oscars myself but want Dano to get the recognition. I feel like he&#39;s one of the most underrated actors working today.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Just watching this trailer gave me goosebumps watching Michelle Williams. I know that she‚Äôll do phenomenal in this film. Hope she‚Äôll finally win the Oscar.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-03-18,"This movie is a blend of powerful emotions of all variety;sad, happy, disgust,guilt, you name it and it&#39;s there. Its cinematography is compelling, background score is pleasing to the ears, screenplay&#39;s pace is adequately fast, and also the brilliant acting from Sam&#39;s mother and Paul Dano(surprised that he has aged so much). So i strongly recommend it worth watching.<br>P.S: john ford&#39;s &quot;where is the horizon&quot; üòÇ"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-09-10,I had the EXACT same movie camera ( 1958 Kodak Brownie ) to make my first films as well as a kid. My parents owned it from the 1950&#39;s.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-03-05,"Just left the cinema watching this movie. What a gem! And the scene with uncle Boris, sent chills down my spine"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Spielberg always knows how to deliver the tears!
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"Steven Spielberg is the director who made me want to be a director. I‚Äôm in my last year in college, taking film courses, hopefully going to direct a short for once. From the looks of this trailer, The Fabelmans will be as magical as Close Encounters, ET, Raiders, and even West Side Story!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-28,Looks like Spielberg finally made another movie he&#39;s genuinely passionate about. It&#39;s been a long time. This looks great.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-14,Wow a breath of fresh air. A period piece film that doesn‚Äôt look like modern residents of San Francisco and New York
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-09,Loved this film from the opening scene. So many more layers than I anticipated and kept me involved start to finish.  Highly recommend
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I‚Äôm literally crying my eyes out! And this is only the trailer‚Ä¶ dear lord, what an amazing storyteller, and a movie about the divine inspiration to share stories, evoke emotions and thoughts. Such a special and wonderful gift to the world!"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Paul Dano is such a remarkable performer
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"After directing several big budget movies in the past 5 years or more, I&#39;m happy to see Spielberg going back to basic making what it seems like a smaller indie type low key movie eventhough this is a Universal Pictures movie"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-10-20,This is the kinda stuff I miss seeing from Spielberg. <br><br>Emotionally powerful.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-12-17,Please let this be as good as I want it to be.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-14,Paul Dano. As always delivering amazing acting. Can‚Äôt wait for this movie
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-11-01,Paul Dano  might get an Oscar  finally. I  love him.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I honestly can&#39;t wait to see this film!! Spielberg is one of my all time favorite filmmakers, and to see a film that&#39;s sorta based on his childhood is going to be a huge treat."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2024-02-16,Trailer itself gave me chills as a wannabe filmmaker it really touches you ‚ù§
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Always can rely on Spielberg to bring us real cinema
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-03-08,Just finished watching this. Loved every bit of it. Thank you Steven Spielberg.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-05-09,Old man Spielberg took &quot;I direct my own story&quot; into a next level
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Some early reviews already call it one of Spielberg‚Äôs best in a really long time and based on this trailer I can absolutely believe that.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-02-07,"Me a film student in NYC cried so much while watching it. I love the Fabelmans so freaking much. The best family , the best mom and dad, the best siblings I have ever wanted"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,"I remember reading a book about Steven from my middle school library. And I never imagine what it would be like to see his upbringing come to life. As a cinephile, I‚Äôve seen The Color Purple, War of the Worlds, Jurassic Park, the Indiana Jones series, ET, Jaws, Hook and most recently West Side Story."
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-05-13,"If this is truly based on Spielberg&#39;s life, how lucky he was. To be surrounded by family and not have any outsiders destroy his dream. To be able to do what his dream was is remarkable for any child growing up. A terrific supportive family in all the ways it really counts. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Congratulations, David, on having your dreams come true. You are truly a gifted storyteller. Always have been. Thank you üíô"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-10-20,My favorite director till this day is Steven Spielberg I can&#39;t wait for this film.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-01-14,love that last shot - literally the first thing my Dad would say to my brother and i in the car every other wknd when he had us and we&#39;d go see a Sunday afternoon movie
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2024-01-10,The movie is breathtakingly well made
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-11,Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever cried just from the trailer of a movie but here we are.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2023-02-11,Damn Spielberg is such a good storyteller. You won&#39;t be able to turn away from your screen I promise. A 10/10 movie. I decided to watch it late at night &amp; it&#39;s now 4am lmao I was glued to the very end thinking I&#39;d maybe get bored earlier but I loved every second.
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2025-01-25,"This film needs a theatrical re-release! It came out just as cinemas were just getting back on their feet and didn&#39;t get the audience it should have. A very underrated Spielberg movie that deserves much more acclaim for not just the work of Spielberg, but the performances throughout! That is my subjective opinion x"
The Fabelmans,D1G2iLSzOe8,2022-09-17,"I met Spielberg‚Äôs mother at her restaurant many years ago, she was amazing, so kind."

I&#39;ve always been a Christian but I used to think of Jesus as this deity figure that healed people and pointed the way to our Father but now he&#39;s truly real to me.

The Chosen Season 3 Finale,NzVAJufqQfo,2023-01-18,Hearing the beatitude really really brings tears into my eyes.. it stuck on me so deep as if the Lord is reminding me that come find me.. look for me.. and don&#39;t ever forget me.. <br>Last week my sister was operated with stage1 cancer and she watched the chosen which I enforced.. she cried so much and in awe of the faith of everyone Jesus healed.. may we all be healed.. emotionally physically and spiritually<br>. let&#39;s seek God and stay faithful ‚ô•Ô∏è

I am on social security, so I really need to thank those of you who paid it forward.  May GOD bless you as much as I&#39;ve been blessed.   I went and saw Season 3, episodes 1 &amp; 2 and saw the finale today.  Lord willing I will be able to see future episodes when they are shown in theaters.  I will not go to the theater when they show the crucifixion of YESHUA.  I have cried every Season at multiple episodes, but I&#39;m afraid I will be too much of a disruption for that episode.

Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-24,"The fact Hollywood hates this while the audience loves it is reason enough it‚Äôs a legit great movie. Just in case you all forgot, the critics said Cuties was amazing while everyone else called it child grooming."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,"I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but what I&#39;m hearing a lot so-called critics from Hollywood hate it. So, it&#39;s probably a good movie."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-22,"EXCELLENT and it&#39;s by no means an &quot;Exorcism&quot; movie.   The feeling that you are in the presence of pure evil is done so well and the shifting back and forth between the demon and the actual person keeps you wondering each moment who is speaking.   <br>For non-believers - you are certainly free to express your opinion, in fact that&#39;s a huge part of what this movie is all about.<br>For believers - Yeah,  helps you see why this world is literally being shredded before our very eyes.  Evil is real, as are demons, the devil and Hell and there are only two choices we have and we DO have a choice."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-23,"I just watched this movie, I‚Äôm blown away. I had gotten chills throughout this movie as it really goes in depth with this spiritual battle we‚Äôre going through today. It really is right in front of people face.. it‚Äôs almost as if everyone is content with what goes on. Sean Patrick Flannery, Bravo! Phenomenal performance."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-24,A movie hated by critics and loved by audiences. That should tell u everything you need to know.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-30,"Saw this movie today, everyone in the theater was silent and so engrossed in this film. It was amazing"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-14,"Just finished watching this movie. Forget what critics are saying. EVERYONE needs to see this movie! I&#39;m glad the word is definitely getting out about how great it is. Our theater was SOLD OUT. üôå Amazing all around. Excellent message, very impressive writing, truly outstanding performances! Gonna come back with the entire family!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-12-28,Seriously...Sean Patrick Flannery needed to be nominated for an Oscar!! Wow...what a performance!! I was blown away.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-24,Critics rating - 29%<br>Audience rating - 96%<br>üòÖüëç
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-11,"Couple takeaways (NO SPOILERS)<br><br>(1) Writing was very very good and creative (and direct when it needed to be but very seldomly)<br>(2) Acting was very very convincing. The whole<br>&quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; ie it held my attention and was very immersive.<br>(3) Timing and cinematography were smooth and moved along well.<br>(4) and the message was very mature and relevant.<br><br>Honestly, way way way better than I expected and I definitely recommend seeing it."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-14,‚ÄúIt is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.‚Äù - C.S. Lewis‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Screwtape Letters‚Äô
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-10-11,"It‚Äôs ironic that the same nose-in-the-air, self righteous narcissists who have tried to derail this film are the same people who Nefarious calls out. And it does so in the most incredibly well constructed way possible‚Ä¶with the kind of unvarnished truth that pure evil sometimes inadvertently shines a light on. Exceptional film, worth seeing twice"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,"This movie is ‚ÄúMy Dinner With Andre,‚Äù meets ‚ÄúThe Screwtape Letters.‚Äù The entire thing basically takes place in a single room‚Ä¶and the dialogue is so good that you don‚Äôt even care! This film highlights the importance of good writing and what a great script and wonderful acting can provide."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-23,"After hearing about the terrible critic reviews from Hollywood and amazing audience scores I‚Äôm going to watch it. I‚Äôll report back with my findings.<br><br>Edit: Solid movie. Always trust the people, not rotten tomatoes or Hollywood type reviews. Solid 7.5/10 imo worth the watch"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-10,I saw it last night. Amazingly written. Not exactly horror - but the tension and suspense was definitely there.  Sean Flannery did an amazing job as Nefarious.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-17,"I saw this last night, I did not know this was a &#39;Christian&#39; movie when I saw it.  it gave me chills, SOOO well done.  So intense, so well written.  The guy playing Nefarious should get an Oscar for his performance!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-09,"I don&#39;t know who made this movie but I thought it was incredible! Sean Patrick Flannery&#39;s performance left me in awe. I usually have problems with movies based on biblical themes but this movie was just really freaking good. It was interesting the way the demon described to James how everything came to be yet he so smoothly turned everything to seem as if he and his master lucifer were the ones oppressed by God and that the creation of humans got in their way of &#39;winning&#39; against Him. And I really, really was impressed with whoever wrote this when they had the scene with the Chaplin. In just a few words the &#39;man of God&#39; proved himself to be faithless and the demon knew he wasn&#39;t a threat. This movie was smart and I think it shines out from the rest of this genre for sure."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-19,"This is one of those rare movies that even as you are in the process of watching it, you already don&#39;t want it to end. 10/10 For me."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-28,"I just saw this movie. Absolutely fantastic! Told everyone I know to go see it! Don‚Äôt listen to the critics, they haven‚Äôt been realiable about movies for years now. Go see this movie!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-01,"My goodness....this movie is absolutely AMAZING.  The demons personality is portrayed EXACTLY like we see in the Bible.  This movie is getting ALOT of hate from Hollywood types etc. because it portrays the REAL evil in this current world. Those people don&#39;t think that stuff is evil!  So they HATR the movie or say &quot; Its not that good&quot;   No......This is a masterpiece.  The guy in the movie even tells Nefarious that society has made so much progress! tolerance is at an all time high, acceptance of each other religions etc woke garbage and the demon LAUGHS.  He says &quot; I coulden&#39;t have said it better myself, sometime you humans even surprise us with the evil you come up with&quot;     and the laugh.......so evil and creepy."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-16,"This might have been a small budget but it is well written and very well portrayed. The main character, Sean Patrick Flanery is amazing. <br>Clever story line and believable dialogue."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-09,"When the Hollywood demons hate it, you know it&#39;s going to be a good movie!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-09,One of the very best movies I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.  It actually has a message.  It&#39;s spot on with what&#39;s happening in today&#39;s world.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-10-01,WOW...just WOW!  One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in years!<br>Watched it last night and Sean Patrick Flanery ought to be up for an Oscar!  Insanely brilliant performance!
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-18,I saw the reviews on rotten tomatoes and damn they don‚Äôt like Christianity. I plan on seeing this soon
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-23,Scared me back into church. Screwtape meets Hannibal Lechter to take you on roller-coaster ride of faith. A must see film.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-10,"I was watching this video and then my neighbour came and we watched it together. He said that this video changed his life and touched his heart. I then went and rented a projector and in a big field, all the people in my suburb watched it and it changed their lives too. We all are so grateful.<br>Thank You for this video‚Ä¶"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-23,This is one of the most intense movies I&#39;ve ever watched. The actors were amazing. Brilliant film.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-07,"I just saw it this evening, and it was amazing!  I had to drive 1 hour away (29 miles) due to the fact that none of the theaters near me played it (Kissimmee, FL).  The next closest one was in Lakeland (38 miles).  Needless to say, the acting was amazing. The story was well written, and it definitely got the message across. This is a message that this whole world needs to hear.<br><br>Just for the simple fact that rotten tomatoes have this movie at 32%, Hollywood won&#39;t even talk about it or they downplay it /trash it, etc......  This was the main reason I had to go see it. Highly recommended!!!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-10,"Just saw this movie.  It‚Äôs utterly riveting. The acting, the production, the music and most of all ... the story."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-17,"Best movie I&#39;ve seen in years. It puts you so deep in thought. I got home from the theater and this whole movie kept playing back in my mind. Makes you look at life, heaven, and hell alot different wether you believe or not."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-05-31,"This was a near flawless movie, and excellent watch. <br><br>No special effects, no sex, just a well acted movie. <br><br>I highly recommend!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-24,I just saw this movie and all I can say is it‚Äôs all true because I used to be possessed by demons. I did things I‚Äôm so ashamed of but thank God for the atoning sacrifice of Jesus our King who loves us all.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-21,It‚Äôs just the beginning! Let‚Äôs go Jesus!!!! üëåüèΩüôèüèΩ
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-29,This movie is outstanding! Three of us went to see it together.   So many little things one saw that the other missed that we want to go see it again.  We talked about the movie for hours afterward . The ending is perfect.  Everyone should see this movie.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-20,My Wife and I watched this last week. It is a incredible movie. The perspective that you get from this is a great awakening for a lot of people.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,"Regardless of your views and opinions on the movie, you can at least acknowledge the phenomenal acting that man played. Holy crap! It was great!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,"There was a missionary back in the 1960s in the Philippines. The police called him to come to the jail because there was a woman there with bite marks all over her and she claimed that the demon inside her had done this. He wrote a book about it and they made a movie about this called &#39;Bitten by demons&#39;. My dad,who was also a missionary, had all of us watch this movie. It scared me so bad. I still remember it to this day."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-09,"This is a freaking masterpiece. I loved this film. And believe me, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews. If you like something different, this is just amazing"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-18,I can&#39;t remember a psychological thriller this good since &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  The dialogue is smart and stirring. 10/10
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-24,Great movie went to go see it today üôèüèæ I work in a mental hospital and I read about cases frequently and mean talk about hearing voices that aren‚Äôt theirs. This world is spiritual and I pray many more souls begin to realize this. Thanks for the movie ! P.s The main character (the prisoner) deserves an Oscar for his performance.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-19,"I&#39;ve seen a lot of movies that pander to Christians and superficially touch theological themes but rely almost entirely on jump scares, gruesome obscenities, and cheap tropes to achieve effect...this WASN&#39;T one of them, and it wasn&#39;t even preachy. Nothing undeniably supernatural confirms or denies your thoughts; it is psychologically unnerving and wholly nebulous and I LOVED IT!!!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-13,"This is the best movie so far in 2023!!! It is NOT horror! Its more of a dramatic thriller. No blood guts or gore. Not even any foul language or creepiness. But it‚Äôs so profound and awesome! Your on the edge of your seat the whole time and it‚Äôs basically two guys in a room talking the entire time. It‚Äôs a must see for all open minded, and critical thinking people."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-19,"As a Bible believing Christian I really enjoyed it, the writing was excellent and so was the acting. It was a new and interesting perspective. I‚Äôd really like to see a prequel about the events leading up to that, with the actor that played the demon, he did a phenomenal job."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-15,Whoa?!  I thought Silence of the Lambs was something  - this is on a whole other level!!!! He practically had an orgasm when that abortion was happening...proving just how much Satan hates us.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-15,The critics gave it a low score so I went to see it and saw it twice. Edward Brady needs best actor. Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-04,"Holy moly what a performance and 100% of all of our truth.<br><br>Just amazing, this is the kind of actor who deserves an oscar."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-01-16,"Sean Patrick deserved an Oscar for this.  I never thought he was capable of a role like this because he was never really a character actor, but this is a beast of a performance."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-08,Saw it yesterday. Nothing earth-shattering for me although I do believe evil is ramping up everywhere between humans...but the writing and acting was SUPERB and made watching it worthy. Best part was feeling spiritually protected after I saw it.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-01,When the critics hate it that is your first sign that you need to see a film
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-08-25,"This movie was 12 Angry Men meets The Screwtape Letters. I&#39;m going to watch it again with my Dad because he missed it. Each moment was all-engrossing and utterly captivating. The writing, dialogue, and acting are all S-tier. My only gripe is the last 20 seconds of the film, but it executes basically everything flawlessly."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-26,"I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever commented on YouTube. Went and saw this movie with my wife last night and was absolutely stunned. It isn&#39;t entertainment. For the typical Christian, it is truly education. This is not a Hollywood horror flick. Totally mesmerizing. I look forward to seeing it again. Should be required to be seen by appropriately aged Christians to understand some of the tactics of the enemy."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-12,"This film, unlike The Pope&#39;s Exorcist, in endorsed as a must see by an actual Exorcist."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-31,"it‚Äôs a good one. All the clips are so perfectly well done. Probably the best movie I‚Äôve seen in years. And seeing that hollywood absolutely hates it, I love it that much more"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-25,"This was a great film. I&#39;m not religious, but this was extremely well done and both of the actors killed it!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-26,Just occurred to me... Nefarious wrapped itself around everyone every character in this story at different times...well done Steve...I hope we&#39;re listening
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-24,As a Christian‚Äôs growing up in church I‚Äôve seen many demons get cast out of people and this is definitely realistic.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-09,Brilliant. This movie is one of the best films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. Total props man. Hey there is some serious truth to this. I sware this not a joke anymore. Some people just can&#39;t feel it by the darkness that surrounds us. The acting was off the charts. I definitely will spread the word on this one here.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-05-19,I almost couldn‚Äôt and then didn‚Äôt want to finish watching this film. It ran parallel to decisions I have made or almost made throughout my life. Bravo to those involved with this project. What I know is love is stronger than hate and I choose it in every interaction. My will is weak. Our Father‚Äôs will is not. I simply gave it back and will live forever. They want us to feel disconnected and alone. We are not and were never alone. May The Most High show us mercy and heal all that he miraculously created. May his will be done.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-08-14,Just listened to an exorcist say this is the ONLY movie he has seen that comes remotely close to what he experiences on the daily. I&#39;m here on his recommendation.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,GO SEE THIS. It‚Äôs scary in the sense of how well it relates to society today
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-14,"Just saw this today. If you‚Äôre expecting action or a lot of visual scares, you‚Äôll be disappointed. This is a deep, intense conversation between an atheist and a demon. The topics they discuss hold no limits and the controversies of today are all put on the table. Nefarious doesn‚Äôt sugar coat anything. He puts in blatant terms what is. So much information was discussed I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep up with it all, so I‚Äôll definitely be watching again. <br>Really makes you think about the world you live in and the decisions you make in your everyday being. <br>The ending was also perfect. A final ‚Äútold you so‚Äù from Nefarious. <br>Can‚Äôt wait to see it again!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-30,"This doesn‚Äôt feel like a movie. Usually when a character goes through a hard time in a movie, I just remind myself it‚Äôs just a movie and don‚Äôt feel as touched. But seeing the distress Edward goes through especially at the end really hit me"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-27,"Woah, i havent had a scary movie trailer give me chills in a LONG TIME!!! Screw what the mainstream media says.<br>Im watching this TONIGHT!!!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-23,"I really want to see this movie. Also, as for the people in the comments who are hating on the movie. Don&#39;t engage. Just look at them as a sign the movie is doing a God&#39;s work. If it wasn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t even bother.<br> Kind of suspicious to harbor so much hatred towards something they claim doesn&#39;t even exist... I mean, I don&#39;t believe in unicorns... but I don&#39;t hate them either."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-25,An amazing movie. One of the best I&#39;ve watched for years. Can&#39;t recommend it enough if you like horror with a twist.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-13,"THE CRITICS HATE IT,<br>BUT THE PEOPLE LOVE IT,<br>THIS IS A BANGER OF A MOVIE"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-30,Honestly im glad they made a movie like this. Cant wait to see it.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-01-22,"I went into this movie completely blind, didn&#39;t even know it was a Christian movie, I just kept seeing it recommended on Prime and after reading the description decided to give it a try since it sounded like something I would like (I watch a lot of weird horror movies) and it blew me away. This movie is amazing and I would recommend it whether you&#39;re a believer or not although having some knowledge of Christian theology probably helps make it more interesting."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-25,Literally the best movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. Absolute masterpiece
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2025-01-08,"Out of all the movies I&#39;ve watched,this one tops the list."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-06,"I&#39;ve been a paramedic for 28 years. I&#39;m a supervisor, and I train students during their clinical rotations (including special operations combat medics from all around the country). <br>In my career, I&#39;ve had many, many bizarre patients, but I&#39;ve only had one who I think was possessed. Due to HIPPA laws, I can&#39;t say much about this patient... but enough years have gone by that I feel comfortable saying this: This grown adult patient went from being perfectly normal and sane, to suddenly spending days in his parent&#39;s basement, staring at a furnace. The parents were terrified of him, and warned us: &quot;You&#39;re not going to like it down there. There&#39;s something wrong. You can feel it.&quot;<br>As soon as you step down the stairs into the basement, you COULD feel it. It&#39;s been over fifteen years, and I have goosebumps as I type this. <br>The man had been staring at his furnace, talking to snakes that were not there. He told his parents (and us) that the snakes were telling him to do bad things. He just stood there, whispering to them, and when you entered the basement, you could feel a sort of palpable and evil presence. I know that sounds melodramatic, but I&#39;m not sure how else to describe it. <br>If it were just for that, I would say he had schizophrenia, and I just let the parents freak me out... but I kid you not, his back had bite marks all over it. You could see the teeth imprints. <br>I&#39;m very happy to say I have never had to return to that house."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-04-22,This movie is the most accurate portrayal of the Demonic Realm . I would say that is 92 percent biblically accurate. It has no profanity and it will perfect for a movie to be shown at church especially when teaching on demon possession‚ù§
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-15,"Just watched this last night. Excellent movie. Really got the point across of what is really happening in todays world. Sean did an excellent performance, no doubt about it. People need to wake up."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-15,"Ephesians chapter <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txwrLGAL7Sg&amp;t=371"">6:11</a>-12 <br>Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&#39;s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-01-20,It&#39;s on Tubi for free...and it&#39;s better than what I expected.<br>I would say it&#39;s not a horror but more a thriller...majority of the movie are 2 characters but don&#39;t let that deter you.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-15,"I heard from the producers that some bad shit happened to them while making the film.  One of them said he got into a car accident seven times, the roof blew off during a storm on set, only roof to blow off, and they had a priest on set who had his appendix burst.  There were more things that happened as well."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-20,"It‚Äôs a great movie, great script and great acting! Support this movie people because it‚Äôs more real than you might think."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-08,"This movie was so freaking good. I was so impressed with the acting and dialogue, and how close it stayed to biblical canon"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-01-25,"To whom it may concern:   I discovered this movie because of a ‚Äúhorror group‚Äù I joined on FB.  I watched it completely raw, didn‚Äôt even watch the trailer for it.  <br>Oh my frikken gods‚Ä¶let me use small words‚Ä¶so you understand ü§≠.  In my humble, horror addicted opinion, THIS WAS FANTASTIC.   I suggest: make popcorn, get a a drink, close the lights and ENJOY"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-18,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>Ephesians 6:12"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-06-03,The fact the demons in Hollywood that hate the movie don‚Äôt like it because  it hit so close to home blowing a hole in they plan. And they need us to be blind to reality
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-07-11,The performance of Sean Patrick Flanery by itself makes this a must see. I rented it on Amazon for $5.99 and have watched it 4 times in two days. The ending is disappointing but it&#39;s only 15 seconds and you&#39;ll get over it :)
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-09-17,There is no blood and no gore. This is the scariest movie ive ever seen. Truly terrifying.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-30,"Ok, this film seriously ROCKS! üéâüéâüéâIt is like the best acting I have ever seen. This man who played N. reall deserves an Oscar for this role. Really fantastic acting. And talking about film itself - you have to see this....trust me!!!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-15,Just saw this movie and whoaüòÆ ..it will open your eyes on what&#39;s in the spiritual realm behind all evil going on
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-30,Looking forward to watching this. If Hollyweird is slating it that&#39;s normally a great sign lmao.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-08-11,the reason i don&#39;t put much stock in the decisions made by those who decide who wins academy awards is because movies like this don&#39;t see the light of day at the academy.   sean patrick flannery and the screenwriter for this movie should both win the oscar for their performances.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-01-30,"Bottom line, demons are real, and they can possess anyone who does not have the Holy Spirit in them.  The Bible is clear on that."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-23,the movie is a crash course on catholic theology regarding good and evil... it is a movie for our times as we are confronted with a real spiritual battle whether you acknowledge it or not... my youtube channel has plenty of resources in the playlist section to further help reconciling reality and faith
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-27,"Even the trailer is very well done,they dont let you know shit.<br>Thats how a trailer is done,if you want to know the plot go see the movie. Bravo."
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-11-06,"I just saw this movie...Read your Bible&#39;s people because demons are real and Jesus cast them out, its all written in the Bible....Jesus is the Way the Truth and the Life...and He love us all &lt;3"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-14,"I&#39;ve seen it in real life. Working with a death row female in our hospital setting. <br>I came up to the front desk and openly told everyone that I prayed for God&#39;s protection each time I had to go in her room. <br>I worked with a guy who wasn&#39;t into Christianity and he looked at me and said he had to admit that he asked for protection when he went in her room. She was executed a few years later. <br>I took a deep breath and thought to myself,  thank you God!"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-09,Sean Patrick Flannery is such an amazing actor!!  I&#39;m really looking forward to watching this movie!!
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-29,FINALLY A MOVIE WORTH SEEING!!! (Believe the hype.) ü§òü§òü§òü§ò
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2024-08-15,Every review of this movie sounds as though I&#39;m to get invited into a multi-level marketing group before it&#39;s over
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-01,Its not a horror movie...its a thriller and its good.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-05-01,"Just watched the movie. Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a decade. That includes interstellar, they live, 2001 a space odyssey, and Apocalypse Now. <br><br>Go see it. <br><br>Demonic possession is real"
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-04-28,This movie was a real eye opener.
Nefarious,txwrLGAL7Sg,2023-06-16,"An absolute masterpiece, really great psychological drama..."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,Such an amazing story.  I don&#39;t think people realize the journey this man went on.  Get your tissues ready.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-07,"Im so glad that George Foreman has his own movie, his story is so inspiring. Most of the people think that Foreman ends in &quot;Rumble in the jungle&quot; when that was only a chapter. If anyone deserves love from the Boxing fans is George."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-18,"I always wanted a movie about his life, especially his comeback were he became heavyweight champion at 45. His story is super inspirational"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-08,"Everyone only talks about Ali, Tyson and Holyfield, but they don&#39;t understand the greatness and importance of Big George inside and outside the ring, he deserves this movie."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-05,"I‚Äôm sure George is sick and tired of being asked about his fight against Ali, but every single time he does he never says anything bad about Ali. Always talks in high regards of Ali, just goes to show how much of a humble man Foreman is!"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,RIP George Foreman you are and will always be my Favorite Boxer and Favorite Houstonian! You will be missed in Texas.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-04,<b>George Foreman</b> is a straight up legend dude got the title back at an age no boxer would ever succeed at and he did
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-02,"George Foreman was the victim of the most famous defeat in boxing history;  yet not only was he not prepared to let that be his legacy, he actually reconstructed himself both mentally and physically to return decades later to reclaim his title at the grand old age of 48!  You couldn&#39;t make it up - its why I love boxing history and this great individual so much."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-03-20,"I got goosebumps when they showed the fight with Ali and Moorer.  These are truly the greatest moments in boxing.  I am very glad that a film is being made about George Foreman.  It is high time.  This is one of my favorite boxers.  And his story is truly amazing.  To regain the heavyweight title after 20 years, and also to take into account the fact that he trained with Sony Liston himself.  Marvelous.  I am very glad that he is still alive and that he himself will be able to watch this film.  Many people around the world will be waiting for this film (for example, I am from Uzbekistan).  A real WORLD champion."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-06,When Foreman got older you just wanted him to win.  His charisma and good natured attitude was gravitating.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-08,Foreman is a national treasure. This was long overdue.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,RIP BIG GEORGE FOREMAN‚Ä¶. We will surely miss you in the world of boxing.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,Boxing movie without will Smith or Jamie foxx. It&#39;s a new day people
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,"Very nice and deserving of a movie! What George Foreman did and how he made his comeback, it&#39;s absolutely amazing and just unheard of. Nobody has a comeback story like that."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-02-22,"Chronological order, no nudity, no pretentious camera angles nor egocentric artful editing; just good pacing, excellent casting and acting -- a focus on telling George Foreman&#39;s life story. This is how to make a biographical film. Refreshing."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-04,"Foreman was a devastating puncher. However, to become Heavyweight champion for the second time he took some brutal hits, but never quit. That&#39;s what made him a legend.<br>Tyson once said punches start to hurt a lot more when you&#39;re older."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-03,This actually looks Oscar worthy. The casting and acting is perfect. I really can‚Äôt wait for this!!!
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-04-04,"Can&#39;t wait to see this movie with my 21year-old son. We need to show support for movies like this, that lifts us up and shows what faith can do"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-04,BIG George. Better recognize how GREAT this man was/is. 76-5 w/68 KO‚Äôs. Recaptured the heavyweight championship‚Äî19 yr gap from initially claiming the title. Often don‚Äôt feel he gets the full recognition. Top 5 HW All time üí™üèΩ
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-07,"I was an Ali fan but I also really respect George Foreman and the destructive fighter he was. What I really respect about foreman was after that huge upset loss to Ali, he went toe to toe in an absolute war with Ron Lyle. He got knocked down multiple times but was able to persevere. I think a lot of fighters take an easy opponent after a loss, but foreman went to battle with one of the hardest hitters in boxing history. Respect."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urKDu40iaXk&amp;t=61"">1:01</a> this part hits so different now rest in peace George"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,"The guy who plays George, Khris Davis, I saw him in Death of a Salesman on Broadway last month. He was good. I&#39;m excited for this."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-05,"Its about time.  I honestly cant understand why no one has made this movie til now, George&#39;s story is pure cinema gold.  I just hope they&#39;ve done him justice and made a great film."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-17,"Big George is a legend. One of the hardest hitters in boxing, with a crazy comeback story"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-18,"Big George is the definition of doesn&#39;t matter how long you take to get back up as long you get back up and keep fighting through your hurdles, you are stronger than you will ever know can&#39;t wait to see this movie üëèüèº"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-11,What he did at 45 years old is crazy impressive. He was every Dad&#39;s hero at the time. I can remember my dad and his friends talking about it for days afterwards.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,"RIP George Foreman (January 10, 1949 ‚Äì March 21, 2025), age 76<br>You will be remembered as a legend"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-06,&quot;Is that all you got George&quot; - Ali after George landed his hardest punch. Both were such legends man!
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-09,"About time they made a film about this legend. Beating Frazier and looking unstoppable only to end up getting broken by Ali, having a religious experience at his lowest point that turned his life around, winning the title again at 45, making hundreds of millions selling grills. Man had a wild life"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-21,One of the most remarkable sportsman in history. His story absolutely needs to be told.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-05,It&#39;s about time this man gets a biopic. One of the greatest heavyweights in the history of boxing. Can&#39;t wait to see this when it comes out.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-06,So glad to see Big George get honoured on the big screen!  He is truly an inspiration to me and I find watching his interviews a great comfort!
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-03-07,"One of the greatest sports achievements in History is what George Foreman accomplished. It is one thing to go through the intense training, running, dietary demands, rest schedule, weight training, sparring, etc etc etc at 19 years old. But to recapture the heavyweight title of the world at 40+ years old is A PHENOMENAL achievement! Absolutely stunning, particularly if you have more than a casuals observation of the sport. George is the last of the 3 great heavyweights of his era still alive and should be considered, at this point, a very precious resource. He also sings btw, and not badly, and spoke of releasing some music soon. I will DEFINENTLY see this movie!"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-05,Bruhh this is going to be a great movie
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,Foreman‚Äôs career and then comeback story is amazing üíØ
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,Rest in peace Big George.  A true legend has left us.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-10,"With everything George did, lost, then overcame greater than when he started, I will always think of him not as &quot;the greatest&quot;, that meme has been taken, but rather the &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot;.  Such an amazing man and amazing life both inside and outside the ring."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,"Just heard Big George has passed. <br>What a man he was. Born into abject poverty in Houston and a street thug. Found boxing during a socially-funded effort to get young people into work. Brooding, morose character reminiscent of Sonny Liston. Won Olympic Gold medal and later the World Heavyweight championship by blasting out all opponents. Lost to the late, great Mohammad Ali but fought on for a few years before finding God and dedicating his life to Him. Lost all his money and decided to return to boxing. Beat southpaw (first) Heavyweight Champion Michael Moorer after a few years of comeback fights to become the oldest Heavyweight Champion in history. No longer the morose, brooding monster, but the jolly uncle everyone loved. <br>If my life ever amounts to one percent of Mr Foreman‚Äôs life, I‚Äôll die a happy man. ü•∞"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,"Sony, please re-release this back into theaters.<br>R.I.P. George Foreman Jan 10, 1949 - Mar 21, 2025"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-06,Always wanted there to be a movie about Foreman. Such a fantastic story. So glad we‚Äôre getting one now!

Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-02,I already know his story and I am so happy to see that millions are going to get to know this man and what he went through and did üò¢üôè
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-22,"God rest your soul, George! We&#39;re gonna miss you on this Earth..."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-04-28,I watched this movie yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it. I love boxing movies and inspirational/uplifting movies like these. I&#39;m so happy George Foreman finally received a biopic because he is often overlooked when it comes to boxing history. His story is inspiring and powerful.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-05,"I watched this all play out in real time, and watched the title fight live with my Dad. EPIC."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-02-03,Just watched this movie. Had my attention from start to finish. Such a great movie and it‚Äôs obvious they put a lot of effort into mimicking foreman‚Äôs style
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-07,I have always found the life story and testimony of George Foreman as one of the most powerful stories in boxing.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-10,"I always dream about this movie. Not only my favourite boxer, but also one of the most shocking life stories I ever heard in this sport."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2024-02-28,"I love George. I&#39;m from Houston. He was my hero and when he lost to Ali that hurt, i couldnt believe he lost. But then he regained the title 20 years later and i&#39;ll never forget that moment. I took up boxing too."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,"I can&#39;t believe the similarities in resemblances. <br>I love Khris Davis in the show &quot;Atlanta&quot; <br>I also met him with my mom, and he is a blessed dude in his energy.<br>He deserves all the success that comes with this role. üôèüèæüëëüèÜ"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-03-19,one of the hardest punchers of all time. he used to break the heaviest heavy bags which is insane. he made a couple grills too
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-24,Rest in peace big George Foreman one of the greatest documentaries I&#39;ve ever watched we&#39;ll miss you forever man ü•äüêê‚ô®Ô∏èüëëüïäÔ∏è
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-04,I&#39;m not old enough to have seen George in his 20&#39;s. But I damn shole was old enough to see George win fights in his 40&#39;s. That was crazy!
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-03,"I have waited majority of my life for a biopic of George Foreman. His life, achivements, experiences, personality and cultural impact was made to be re-made on the silver-screen. I tell you, I have since kids days loved Big George and he is evreything you could ever wish for in a role model for a kid/young man who is growing up and in need of inspiration.<br><br>The lead actor I have to see what he can do in portraying Foreman (something that is a difficult task considering his size, personality and look) but I tell you, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt based on how difficult it is to make one look like him.<br>It was far easier with Mohammad Ali or Mike Tyson or Sonny Liston or Rocky Marciano etc. in there respective bio movies.<br><br>Now I so look forward for this movie in April :-D<br><br>God bless you &quot;Big&quot; George Foreman.<br>76-5-0, KO&#39;s 68<br>2-time Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World<br>1968 Olympic Heavyweight Gold medalist."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2025-03-11,"I genuinely enjoyed watching this film. It was great to watch a well-acted film with a defined narrative and without any bad language. Thank you to the director, script writers and producers. üôèüëèüèªü•ä"
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-04-30,This was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. I&#39;m going back to the theaters to watch it a second time.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-03-05,Everyone is gonna love his story. It has everything you want in a redemption story and above all it was real.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-04-15,"It‚Äôs great they‚Äôve done this whilst foreman is still with us, appreciate them now before they‚Äôre gone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2024-02-12,"Just saw it, great movie. I was already familiar Foreman&#39;s story and they really did it justice. From a troubled young man to a man of god but always a true champion."
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-07,My favorite detail of George Foreman‚Äôs story is that the trunks he wore during the fight with Moorer were the same trunks he wore when he lost to Ali. Brings it full circle for a nice book end.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-07,I will always remember the words &quot;it happened!&quot; God bless you George Foreman! Big love from Ireland üáÆüá™

Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-01,People underestimate Foreman. He is legit in the top 10 heavyweight of all time.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-03-20,A man playing Sonny Liston needs to be in this movie!!George saw him as a father figure.
Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-02-13,"About time a movie was made about Big George&#39;s story. He was one of my heroes while growing up, and by all accounts is an extraordinary human being. This looks good, I hope the final product lives up to the real thing."

Big George Foreman,urKDu40iaXk,2023-08-29,"The script didn&#39;t do George Foreman justice. Oh, well. Glad Netflix did something on him, he&#39;s a true inspiration and it&#39;s good to be reminded of his story"

Tiger 3,vEjTUDjjU6A,2023-10-19,It&#39;s the first time I am feeling excited for an action film...credit goes to Emraan hashmi
Tiger 3,vEjTUDjjU6A,2023-12-10,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEjTUDjjU6A&amp;t=122"">2:02</a>, The towel fight is with Hollywood star and outstanding stunt action performer Michelle Lee(XII) from &quot;Black Widow&quot;.

Tiger 3,vEjTUDjjU6A,2023-11-21,Tiger always ready  to break all records
Tiger 3,vEjTUDjjU6A,2023-10-18,"Happy to see that more than 50 % comments on Emraan Hashmi, that means people are recognising him as a Talented and solitary actor rather than Serial kisser. <br>Very Good. Emraan will nailed in any role ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòäüòäüòä."

Tiger 3,vEjTUDjjU6A,2023-10-16,My god Katrina is just so damn effortless and badass in the movie. Her hand to hand combat scenes just top notch. She is so damn talented. Zoya Zoya ‚ù§
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-18,This movie was beyond excellent. The moment that they talked about how there is no bad forgiveness but that sometimes forgiveness and permission can be confused was phenomenal. I really enjoyed this!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-09,Finally a film to put me to sleep these last few weeks have been pretty stressful for me the final tests really did a number on my sleep schedule a movie like this is is perfect for me so i can get the sleep i need making sure i dont fail is really important thank you to everyone who took part in this film for giving me the sleep i need
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-01-23,I grew up in and around this cult. This is incredibly accurate. The clothing and the head coverings. The only thing that throws me off is that they are speaking English instead of low German (flat German).
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-13,CONGRATULATIONS TO SARAH POLLEY!!!! She won Best Adapted Screenplay the Oscars!!!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-05-27,"Such a beautiful movie. Why is it that as a woman who is incredibly privileged and protected, I can still relate to these characters and understand their struggles? I just felt so close to them, like I was there üòî"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-02,"Watch this movie.... this movie touched my soul like no other movie has in a very, very long time. Such a horrific story and yet told with such strength and such beauty. These women are heroes."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-26,"I highly recommend watching this movie. A rare, poetically executed piece of art with spectacular performances."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-08-18,"Hard to see the truth if people liked this movie, at least the trailer, when Youtube hides negative reviews."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-14,"Jeez, what&#39;s up with this comment section? Was the title enough to give certain people red flags? People need to educate themselves."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-10,When you see Frances McDormand in the cast you know it&#39;s gonna be incredible
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-11-08,Saw this at a film festival last weekend and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.  Very moving with exceptional performances and musical score.  I can&#39;t wait for the official release so I can see it again!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-12,"Wow, this comment section is terrible.  God forbid women stand up for themselves against abuse, or make films about it!  It‚Äôs almost like <b>some people</b> think women should be treated like property‚Ä¶"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-09,This movie was profound and incredibly well done. I want to see it again it was phenomenal. I hope that people will remember the true story of what has happened and is still happening to the women in Bolivia
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-14,"The cast in this alone is amazing, the photography just makes it chef kiss. Can&#39;t wait to see this"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-14,A film based on entirely unique FEMALE based experience. Congratulations to Sarah Polley. A job well done.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-17,Sarah Polley is simply brilliant at anything she does.  I recommend anyone who liked this film view Stories We Tell.  Her documentary about her life.  It&#39;s absolutely one of the best films ever made.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-12-01,This movie changed my life!<br>Been struggling with insomnia for yearsüò≠ <br>Can&#39;t thank you enough!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-10,"First comment and all I&#39;m going to say is CLAIRE FOY IS BACK SHE&#39;LL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS . GIVE HER THE OSCAR ALREADY, SHE DESERVES IT üèÜ"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-17,OMG THE SCENE WHERE THE WOMEN JOIN TOGETHER AND GO UP AGAINST THE MEN AND SAY ‚Äúit‚Äôs talkin time‚Äù WAS THE MOST EMOTIONAL SCENE EVER!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-09,My favourite part was when all the women rated themselves a 10.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-12,Oh lord with that title the jokes are gonna write themselves lol
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-11-01,"Love the score so far, hopefully Hildur wins her second Oscar for it üôè"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-23,i didn&#39;t expect ben whishaw to make me cry. i&#39;ve known him as Q for a long time and seeing him nail a more emotionally challenging role is amazing
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-09,"I dont get these misogynistic comments. I, for one, LOVEED this trailer. In 2021, I was diagnosed with a sleeping disorder, and because of this award winning film. I am able to sleep at night soundly knowing there are women out there who turn oppression fantasies into reality! ‚ù§"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-12,"One of the best directors, so many good actresses, and a real topic that affects women everywhere.  Owning one&#39;s own body and mind is the most basic human right that all women are denied to different degrees everywhere.  <br><br>Parents: start teaching teaching boys (and girls) that they are equal and treat them the same. Girls are not little adults and should be allowed to have fun and laugh . . . boys can be caring/sensitive and have platonic friendships with girls."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-05-17,"This is SUCH a good movie--beautifully done. Plus, Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, and Frances McDormand are such phenomenal actresses."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-10,Is it too late to change the colour grade?
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-12,My favorite part is where the main character stands tall and says &quot;There is a tempest in me!&quot; While demanding to see King!<br><br>This movie is stunning and brave!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-05-12,I loved the score...so moving. It gave me goosebumps and made me cry at the end.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-14,"I read up on the real case in a South American Mennonite community that inspired this film, and it is WILD. This movie definitely won‚Äôt be for everyone, but if it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs gonna be a landmark one."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-22,The book was SO GOOD! Can‚Äôt wait to see this!

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-22,"&quot;Why does love, absence of love, the end of love, the need for love, result in so much violence?&quot; <br>..<br>I have always been in love with the story of &quot;Women Talking&quot; novel, admiring the similarity it contains to my favorite of all &quot;Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot;. And though, the plot of the first is not that much of concentrated, it happened to be profound the same. So the story is a little bit harsh and contains so much violence for it talks about a series of abusing happened against the women of a single isolated city in America in 2010, where women had no learning nor ability to talk for themselves which was a massive contradiction to the year the events are in. If I am to talk about the movie, the act didn&#39;t disappoint me at all, especially Ona, or as it was named in the novel &quot;the dreamy serene&quot; and Salome!!! which was played by the actress that I was in love with her role in The Crown &quot;Claire Foy,&quot; don&#39;t let me even start with August, which is the main character in the novel, however, a secondary one in the film and I think that&#39;s really a great idea for the feeling of contradiction and conflict when a male is telling a story of female rage and wrath. Also, I liked how the dark environment of the novel did not disappear and have been transformed perfectly with much unbelievable shots and conversations, though I wanted them to change the ending of the two main characters and the only love story in the novel &quot;Ona &amp; August&quot;. Anyway, this was really an extraordinary thing to watch and did not disappoint me in any sort. LOVED."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-13,I like how this film is not totally in black and white but has that sort of shade. I think it is more realistic looking than movies that are vibrantly colored with video editing and don‚Äôt look natural. I think the darker shades in this movie are probably also easier on the eyes.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-12-29,"Wish Frances had been in more scenes. Thought she would be involved in the hay loft discussions, and been a big part of it."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-02-03,"10 million views , and as many dislikes as likes . the story tells itself"
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-25,I will watch anything with Jessie Buckley in it
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-24,So inspirational.  Sad to see that this happens in so many society.  I&#39;m fighting my indian community where women are subjected to unbelievable atrocities in the name of religion in England started by a cult in india . Mostly created by men then now other women who have these false beliefs. Let is hope and be string at continue to fight. We are strong !
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-26,Yeah Rooney Mara has all my attention. Her lines delivery are so deep and soulful.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-11-15,Francis was born to be in this film. A true elder.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-03-04,This was a very good movie. I was compelled for the whole time. I was surprised by the exceptional performances
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-25,Happens everywhere to anyone vulnerable. Hopefully it gets everyone talking and abusers punished
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-03-20,Only thing this trailer is missing is cats. Lots and lots of cats.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-12-21,I read the book and remember thinking it read like a play. Look forward to this
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-15,Do yourself a favor and watch Despot of Antrim&#39;s review of this trash.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-11-26,Thank you Sarah Polley! This looks amazing!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-01-08,"Im looking forward to seeing this, but I already know that I&#39;ll be bugged by the changes from the real story. As far as i know (and i have a family member who went there, and stayed there for a while, and interviewed the men in jail.) there have never been any real answers. I am deeply saddened by this happening in my culture... I hope this movie has treated my culture respectfully."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-12-09,THE CAST üî•
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-11-03,What.a.cast. cant wait
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-22,"I&#39;m extremely disappointed that the makers of this movie did not accurately portray these events. The men of this community this happened to banded together the minute they learned of the attacks. One of them staked out a guy they thought might be involved. He caught him breaking into a place and apprehended him himself. He got a posse and roughed him up to get the names of the other guys out of him. All with zero help from police. And there were women who were covering up for the guys who were guilty of this. <br><br>Their moral strength and duty to their community is what allowed them to put an end to this, and it looks like the makers of this movie did them a great injustice, by portraying them as somehow guilty of covering up these crimes. It was exactly the opposite."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-14,I love everything Sarah Polley. üå∏

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-09-30,Women talking? Truly a dystopian nightmare
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-01-24,"wow, such a beautiful and healing movie. The trailer reminds me of the Columbian city created by women only to live safe and in peace. It prompts me to watch it."

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-12-12,"I just watched and have question.  How could they see the Southern Cross when stargazing? Really? I know the real story took place in the southern hemisphere but when they changed the movie to the USA, they probably should have kept that scene out."
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-01-09,Isnt the point of a trailer to get people to watch? With a title like that id stay far away

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-01-16,Waiting to watch this having trouble doing so on YouTube.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-10,The color grading reminds me of a lowbudget movie shot on a super-cheap digital camera in the early 2000s.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-02-15,Saw it earlier tonight.  Quite intense. Very good acting and script.
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2023-01-28,This actually improved upon the novel. I loved it!

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2024-10-09,"I have only watched a small amount of this.  I imagine it is for the most part good‚Ä¶. Although super hollywood naive and lazy.  The fact that each actress spoke differently: tone, accent, etc just reveals the actresses behind the characters and makes it hard to believe.  Hollywood is sooooooo disconnected from the real depth of life."

Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-11,Women Talking will be such a powerful movie!
Women Talking,pD0mFhMqDCE,2022-10-11,When Claire Foy looked into the camera and said &quot;...womensplaining always makes the box-office go brrrrrr...&quot; I almost cried... Truly Oscar material.

Freelance,BrqWlOzm2Iw,2024-02-28,"I really thought this movie was going to be a snore fest. But, I was delightfully surprised that it had not been. The guy that played the Polonia presidente stole the show from John Cena. He was funny and brilliant."
Freelance,BrqWlOzm2Iw,2023-10-31,"It&#39;s sad this movie isn&#39;t getting the attention it deserves. Not enough advertising I didn&#39;t even hear of this movie, but I gave it a chance and it was actually really really good. At least in the top 5 movies of the year for me. Better than a lot of pandering nonsense that came out. I hope more people give it a chance and have a good time watching it."

Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,MIA Goth is the definition of scream Queen<br>Her performance in Pearl is legendary
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,"The intensity of actors like Skarsgard and Goth along with a madman director like Brandon Cronenberg, this movie will surely be a thrill ride. I loved Possessor !"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia Goth sure is the new horror queen.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Very happy to see that Alexander Skarsg√•rd is starring and an executive producer in this film!
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia Goth should star in every horror movie
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-11,Looks very intriguing. I‚Äôm starting to become a Mia Goth fan. Her role as Pearl was one of the most craziest performances I‚Äôve seen these past few years. She‚Äôs not afraid to go all out and be unhinged.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-17,"Seen this movie three times and it&#39;s more brilliant than you think. A lot of people are thinking it&#39;s a horror movie, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s extreme sci-fi. Watch it asap. 5/5 imo."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-12,Infinity Pool looks intriguing. Seems like Mia Goth has been involved in more horror projects these past few years. Good for her. She really suits any type of role she portrays onscreen.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-20,"If this is HALF as good as Posessor, I‚Äôm in! Brandon Cronenburg has taken the torch masterfully"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-10,Mia goth is absolutely terrifyingly good in every film she touches &amp; Alexander is always a pleasure to look at I&#39;ll definitely watch this movie for both of them.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,What this year and next year is proving: Mia Goth knows how to play unhinged in MANY WAYS and play it well
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-10-21,"One of those films that had me keep checking the progress bar to see how far i was into it and then it was over and i was left wanting more. It had great effects, lovely atmosphere, and wonderful actors, but at the end i felt like there was so much more meat on the bone.  While undoubtedly impressive in its individual elements, it struggled to seamlessly unite its various components into a cohesive whole, ultimately leaving me with a sense of missed opportunities and untapped potential. I feel like Brandons best work is still ahead of him."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-29,"I saw this movie today and I had a wonderful time! It felt like an interesting blend between Kubrick and Lynch. It&#39;s not for everybody, but those who enjoy surrealist cinema, GO WATCH IT!"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-10,"This looks scary and disturbing but because Mia Goth is in it, I am here for the movie! She is definitely one of the contenders for the title of Scream Queen!"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-31,Mia Goth will win an Oscar at some point. She&#39;s really becoming next level amazing.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-16,"If you want to get a sense of what this movie might be like, go watch Brandon Cronenberg‚Äôs last film Possessor. It‚Äôs a terrifying sci-fi body horror with some beautiful and haunting cinematography. The story and themes aren‚Äôt completely fleshed out or brought to the most satisfying conclusions, but the visual experience and horror of it all are enticing enough on their own"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-21,"This movie was so weird but I love movies that mess with my mind like this. It felt like a long black mirror episode. And Mia Goth‚Äôs performance in this movie is a 10/10 talented masterpiece, she can ACT wow she is so so talented. I loved her in X, in Pearl (Pearl especially, it‚Äôs my favourite movie that she‚Äôs in, it‚Äôs so good) and now Infinity Pool. She‚Äôs such a good actress and she‚Äôll go far"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,"Brandon Cronenberg is a really good director, eventhough he hasn&#39;t reach the heights of his father&#39;s skills, I think he has a unique bloody vision that would&#39;ve made his father proud. This is the type of horror movie that Mia Goth is perfect at. At this point, she should just star in every horror movie that&#39;s coming"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-04,"Mia Goth is phenomenal, she is the horror queen we all needed"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Possessor was so good can&#39;t wait for this
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia Goth is quickly becoming one of the most promising and talented new stars of this era. She&#39;s like what Florence Pugh was when Lady Macbeth and Midsommar came out.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-11,Alexander skarsg√•rd on a leash makes this a must see for me
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-10,"As soon as it said Brandon Cronenberg film, I was like &quot;oh yes, this makes sense now&quot;. Can&#39;t wait, love Brandon&#39;s movies."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-18,"Cleopatra and Alexander in a movie together, I&#39;m definitely in."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-19,"(SPOILER ALERT) I just saw it, and since I can&#39;t find my interpretation anywhere, here it is. This movie is NOT a commentary on the rich being able to do whatever they want without consequences, quite the opposite. If you look at the movie that way, you will, and should, be disappointed. It&#39;s plain and simple: it&#39;s a story about growing up and being a different person in the process, and having to kill your old self in the process, every time. (So people finding it strange that clones retain all the memory of the original in the process, of course they do.) And you don&#39;t really grow mentally on your own, it&#39;s the confrontation with the world that makes you grow. It can be seen as brutal (as it often is), but also as an act of kindness when the world takes you somewhere where you go beyond your limits and comfort zone (limits of the ¬´¬†resort¬†¬ª), and you become a different person in the process. So, of course, every time a person is cloned in the film, it is the &quot;old&quot; person who dies, NOT the clone, hence the cuts on his face at the end. In order to become someone radically different, he had to kill himself (instead of being the spectator of his own murder, which can be identified as the personality change that occurs in oneself when the world and circumstances make you change but you refuse to change at the same time). The last time, he was killed by himself, like when we decide to change (even if it is under tremendous pressure, we act to change). Mia Goth says that he is a baby, then breastfeed him, because he is a ¬´¬†newborn¬†¬ª individual. We have also to consider the disappearance of the clone metaphorically: when you are reborn / when your become different / when you grow up, what happens to your old self? You merge with it. The old personality and the new personality. It&#39;s all you. So in the end, he kills himself and his old personality merges with the new one, leaving some scars from the old personality that he crushed, and the scars heal pretty quickly, as you can see. At the end, he talks to Em, an element of his old life, but he&#39;s a new person, so he can&#39;t go back to his old environment, and that has to be seen metaphorically too, so, not as a place, or specific person. But the things that surround us when we change. For example, we don&#39;t see most of the people we knew as children, because... we&#39;ve changed, and have nothing in common with them anymore. So, he stays in his new environment, which for us means new friends, a new job, a new house, a new place too, etc. but in the beginning you don‚Äôt have many new friends in this environnement, so in the movie he is alone (but he will meet new people soon in this new environnement). I bet the (bad) writer now has something to say, aka in your life you are more mature. This ending falls flat and is really disappointing when you see it otherwise, but it&#39;s so great when you see it that way. So, in my opinion, this movie says: sometimes people push you to change, and you have your comfort zone and your limits, and you refuse to change, and it hurts (sometimes a lot) when you change, and it hurts even more when not only the circumstances make you change (someone killing your double), but when you decide to change (killing yourself), and you have traces of your old selves (cremation urns) in your luggage (memory). AND, there is this other dimension: if the movie moves you enough, as a great work of art should, you don&#39;t go through it without changing. So, during the movie, during the very act of watching it, you have effectively killed yourself and are now another person. The traces of your old self are in your luggage. How many cremation urns are there already? You tell me."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-09-15,For all intensive purposes this is a good horror film. Don&#39;t watch this film if degradation makes you feel uncomfortable. It is thick with it from beginning to end.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-28,"The trailer has 30 million views! Please please please support this movie in theatres if you can! You&#39;ve seen the reviews online, it is a great flick!"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia Goth is a phenomenal actress and absolutely gorgeous

Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-08-20,"Quickly realized after reading the comments that people are here because they‚Äôre fans of Mia Goth, not because they have watched let alone enjoyed the movie. That will be a pass for me."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-05,I have pretty high expectations for this horror one. 2023 seems to be one of the most anticipated years for horror/thriller films to expect
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Looks absolutely bonkers! Brandon Cronenberg is making a name for himself! This looks promising.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Looking forward to this one! Hoping they would release an uncut version of this as well.

Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-08,"I was acting in this film, the film crew is amazing, the actors are professionals, especially Alexander. Waiting  for the release."

Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,This had an NC-17 at first. I NEED the uncut version.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-02,This movie was so good. Just saw it today. 4 stars.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-16,Possessor was my favorite film of the last decade. I know this will be a must see.<br><br>Only thing it‚Äôs missing is Risenborough again. Her and Cronenberg really knocked it out of the park!
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-14,There is no way in Hell all those comments aren&#39;t bot generated! All this talk about how cool Mia Goth is? We live in scary times. Pretty soon all the comment setions will be nothing but bots talking to each other.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-23,"Absoloutly amazing piece of art. Every aspect of it. From the visuals, to the depth of the concepts. <br>For those who havent watched it yet it is important knowing what the story is about before watching. It&#39;s important to help you understand what is happening, it will enrich the movie tenfold. Here it is- <br>It&#39;s about what happens when someone is so rich that they can buy everything and are becoming numb to life because if it. This is the roller coaster ride of when someone numb finds their way out of that endless spiral... Or, doesn&#39;t. The movie is a masterpiece. Not for the faint of heart however, and requires one to have at least a little depth to them to be able to truly appreciate it. 10/10 For the psychological, horror, thriller genre."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-25,"Coming from the son of THE David Cronenberg, I have high hopes for this. Also, Mia Goth is really making a name for herself in horror. She was brilliant in Pearl and X."

Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-21,"Editing in this trailer is amazing! The plot is similar to Black Mirror episodes, but it&#39;s interesting to see how this will be explored."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-15,This movie looks balls to the wall insane and its about damn time. The fact that they had to cut it from NC 17 to R for theaters gets me pumped.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-13,Omg what amazing casts from Mia to Alexander plus Thomas. Can‚Äôt wait to see this film üéûÔ∏è üëçüéûÔ∏èüëçüéûÔ∏è
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-04-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVnIMvVEkrA&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> Iconic"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-13,Great.  Another trailer that literary shows you the whole story.  I get the best bits thanks.  Don‚Äôt need to watch the movie now üëèüëå
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-01,"I knew Mia Goth had horror / psycho queen written on her when I saw her in Nymphomaniac I and II, and A Cure for Wellness. Now in X, Pearl, and Infinity Pool. BUT y&#39;all have to watch her in EMMA (Jane Austen) with Anya Taylor-Joy, where Mia Goth was a shy, sweet 1800&#39;s lady. Talk about range. She can definitely act, even outside horror or thrillers."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-09,"I‚Äôm here for Brandon Cronenberg after first seeing Possessor: Uncut and following production of this for ages, Mia Goth and Skarsgard is an awesome bonus. The psychological elements in Possessor were unreal"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia GOAT!!! üî•üí™üî•
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-11-21,This trailer gives away the whole movie.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-18,Mia Goth is just gonna be in every obscure horror movie til the end of my days
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-11,"Awesome, trailer gave away loads üëå üëç"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-06-23,"It had all the right ingredients, but sadly, the finished product left me very disappointed."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-07-17,Keep releasing this kinda great movies Neon! ü§òü§ò
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,mia goth has now solidified my pre-existing belief that she‚Äôd make a great harley quinn in matt reeves batman films alongside barry keoghan. that part where she‚Äôs holding the gun at the end of the trailer whilst laughing maniacally? cmon
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-03,"Brandon Cronenberg is creating such amazing movies, David must be proud of him."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-24,"I love Brandon&#39;s work. Possessor Uncut was my favorite film of the latter 2010s. Mia Goth is overexposed to me. I&#39;ve seen her too much and its time she ranks up to something like a big tentpole because her days as an indie actress are coming to an end. <br><br>I will definitely see this, even if the actors involved aren&#39;t my favorite."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-03-24,Just saw this tonight this film was brilliant might have to catch this jawn again
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,"Branden Cronenberg, that explains it. This looks very interesting."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-07-17,Mia Goth deserves an Oscar nomination!
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Mia Goth the queen of horror
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-18,I knew who the director was without even checking. Can&#39;t wait.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-15,Is this supposed to be science-fiction or some alternate reality?  Horror needs some grounding in a relatable setting and this trailer makes the setting seem pretty absurd.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-12-26,Mia Goth needs a price for this role. Movie of the year
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-01-28,This comment is <b>not</b> about Mia Goth.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-12,"Im someone who loved possessor, so i could not be more excited for this"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Infinity Pool: Uncut still exist? I&#39;d love to see the original NC-17 cut.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,Brandon making his dad proud. Can&#39;t wait for this.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-11-24,So it has nothing to do with a swimming pool..... I&#39;ll take my leave now.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2024-03-19,"Alexanders and Mia are both beautiful and great actors, loved this movie, it was almost too much for me."
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-08,We are all agree that Mia Goth is one of the best actress for horror-thriller movies.
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-18,Remember when comments on YouTube was full of diversity. Now a days it&#39;s 95% the same comment just posted differently...almost like it was all bots...Take a look here for example...it&#39;s all Mia Goth
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-19,One of the best movie in the years.. love it
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-10,this looks insane i‚Äôm so excited
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2022-12-09,"Definitely watching this movie! Cronenberg is getting better and better, like father like son!"
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-05-01,literally a masterpiece. can‚Äôt wait to see it on a theater. i have a feeling it‚Äôs set to become a surrealist classic over the next decade
Infinity Pool,PVnIMvVEkrA,2023-02-02,"I really liked this movie but am so glad I didn&#39;t watch this trailer first.  WTF.  Trailers can be an art form, this just devalues the movie  by showing too much; Also: Mia Goth is the best!  JAAAAAAMMMEEES!!!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"This is honestly so true to life. It‚Äôs just so refreshing to see a movie without an overdramatized or cliche plot. Just a couple having the boring day to day issues, but showing the realistic love that keeps them together"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-22,This has to be one of the most relatable films.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"I can&#39;t get enough of A24 films, They perfectly capture the human element in just the most raw form. It&#39;s Beautiful"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,This seems refreshing. We appreciate the fact that A24 has gone through such lengths to produce quality films over time.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"People who can relate to: <b>&quot;Can you shut up and keep talking?!&quot;</b> and take that as a cue, to state their &#39;feelings&#39; will appreciate this story!üòäBest part is every character here seem amiable already!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,So great to see Tobias Menzies here... he&#39;s one of the best actors around these days
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"He is soooo underrated, I&#39;m so so glad Tobias Menzies is going to be in a leading role!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"Julia-Louis-Drefus is a terrific actor, I can&#39;t wait to see this."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-04-09,I love Nicole Holofcener movies. She depicts those little slices of life so accurately without being melodramatic and cringe. Walking and Talking will always be my favorite of hers.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-27,Excited to see Tobias Menzies in this! The most underrated actor in this trailer that no one seems to be mentioning.. hoping this role gets him bigger parts in his next project
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"It‚Äôs so nice to see Arian Moayed out of Succession <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20GWk5cWPBs&amp;t=96"">1:36</a> He‚Äôs a talented actor who deserves accolade!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-22,"I&#39;m glad A24 is making more films like this, I love their horror and experimental films but this kind is missing from cinema a little."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2025-01-27,"I just started watching ‚Äúyou hurt my feelings‚Äù. Omg, I‚Äôm loving it. So relatable &amp; the cast. I keep rewinding to make sure I get it. Love it so far!! ‚ù§üòÇüòÆ"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"This looks like an awesome in-depth, real look at long term relationships. I&#39;m so excited."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,Are you kidding? Tobias and Julia? The duo we never knew we NEEDED.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"Oh man, real-life couple Amber Tamblyn and David Cross as a bickering couple; I am 100% down for that! This looks awesome."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-05-17,The Rilo Kiley song in this trailer came out when I first moved to NYC. It‚Äôs kind of my New York theme song. The person who edited this trailer did not know that but I am very excited to see this movie anyway.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"The song at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20GWk5cWPBs&amp;t=73"">1:13</a> are ‚ÄúSilver Lining‚Äù by Rilo Kiley."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,I&#39;m excited to see Nicole Holofcener and Julia Louis-Dreyfus working together again after the incredible movie &quot;Enough Said&quot; which so happens to be a great feel good movie to watch while traveling for me
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-26,There is a new golden age of cinema coming and A24 is leading that. Love their movies and story telling. NYC has a million stories to tell!
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-11-26,"Calm down everyone, A24 is great but Nicole Holofcener has been making awesome movies just like this for over 25 years. How bout we give some credit to the person who made the film, not just the company who bought and distributed it."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,Julia Dreyfus has been a muse for Nicole lately. Love her movies
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-05-27,"I became a huge fan of Holofcener after Walking and Talking. Every film is fresh, funny, clever and surprisingly emotional. I also love her economy with story; she can get it done beautifully in 90 minutes or so, which is just how long most movies should be. I can&#39;t wait to see this 14 or 15 times."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-07-03,"I loved this movie.<br>No major drama, just a normal life problem.<br>I recommend"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-22,"Whenever I see Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I click. Can‚Äôt wait to watch ‚ù§"

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,so stoked for this!!! JLD really nails the complexities of slice-of-life roles. I miss seeing her on screenüò≠

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-28,"You are my love language, A24!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-06-01,"Just saw this and loved it!. The writing and direction is great and the cast is excellent. Was great to be in a cinema hearing an audience of adults laughing at witty dialogue, at a time when it seems hard to find something that isn&#39;t a Marvel movie.  And as much as l love comedy, I don&#39;t often actually laugh out loud at something, but the surprising dialogue and line deliveries throughout the movie kept catching me off guard and making me burst out laughing. Julia Louis-Dreyfus shows a deeper side of her talent here, going beyond her comedy skills and really bringing her character to life. British actor Tobias Menzies, who played Prince Philip in The Crown, is excellent as the husband. How are Brit actors so good at doing American accents that it never occurs to you they are British?  And loved Jeannie Berlin as the annoying mother. Berlin makes the character real rather than just a sit-com type and her line deliveries are understated and hilarious. I know so many women like her. The audience applauded at the end, something that does not happen often in cinema screenings. Brava, Nicole Holofcener!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-23,I&#39;ll watch a washing liquid commercial by Nicole Holofcener. She&#39;s one of the most underrated writers/directors working today.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-30,Son:‚ÄùMom .. you always expect the best from me‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Mom:‚ÄùYou‚Äôre welcome ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs all I need hear to see this movie üçø!!!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶üëäüèæüíØ
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-05-26,"Yay! I have been waiting for this to release for so long! I adore Tobias and he has so much range and versatility, I am having a hard time wrapping my mind around the American accent but he does it so well!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,A 15 year old Rilo Kiley song for the trailer? I‚Äôm sold
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,Now we only need to tune in for the last 3rd of the film
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"Nicole Holofcener is back, baby!!!"

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-22,This has to be one of the most relatable films. An actual relatable film about relatable things.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-22,Can‚Äôt wait to see a good old-fashioned NY life comedy. Love them. Hope this one measures up. Sounds like people like it.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-05-27,I saw this last night and am still thinking about it. When I wasn&#39;t laughing I was crying. I related to every single scene. I wish more movies were like this.
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"Lovely hearing Jenny Lewis and Rilo Kiley, I can&#39;t believe its been 16 years already since that song came out."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-04-07,"this movie was so so good, def recommend seeing!!"
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-28,I‚Äôd just like to see a movie about a woman over 35 who is not married and doesn‚Äôt have cancer or kids finding joy. The rest of us women would like a movie please. (I‚Äôm writing one now if anyone is interested). This movie about married couples has been done so many times. I do love Julie though ‚ù§

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,I think A24 is the way back to storytelling in movies. Real ground human experience movies that made the golden age of cinema a few decades back.

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-08-06,"We strongly suggest it, don‚Äôt expect a masterpiece but a real story of our day to day life. And, are you going to be honest with your loved ones? Or will you still keep some soft lie to keep their fragile dreams and mood alive? Interesting movie. Let‚Äôs us know if it changed you a bit after watching it. ‚ù§üëç"

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,"Ya&#39;ll, I love A24, but they&#39;re not the only good indie studio out there. There&#39;s lots of them."

You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-26,"A24 doing family dramedy, or any film that&#39;s not super weird, is actually quite refreshing."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-03-21,Tobias Menzies!!! YASSSSS!
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-09-25,"I love how Silver Lining is part of the trailer. Next up, A Man/Me/Then Jim."
You Hurt My Feelings,20GWk5cWPBs,2023-05-17,"that botox joke reminded me of a very similar, equally hilarious one from veep. damn it&#39;s good to see JLD again."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-06,"Completely by chance I was visiting Al Ula, Saudi Arabia when this movie was filmed (the Kandahar scenes were filmed there instead of in Afghanistan for obvious reasons) in December 2021. The car chase scene was filmed on the same street as the hotel I happened to be staying at; there was a car flipped over and police around (to prevent people from getting in the shot), and as I had no idea they were filming a movie I thought there had actually been an accident! Many local people were hired to play Afghani extras and given Afghan clothing, including the manager of the hotel I was staying at, who was Egyptian. It was really strange to see this sleepy Saudi town suddenly turned into Afghanistan over night."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-05,"I see Gerald Butler, I watch movie. Life is that simple!"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-12,Gerard Butler can‚Äôt make a bad action film. God bless that man.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-05-31,This movie was amazing throughout. Highly recommend it. the helicopter scene at night in the desert is pure beauty.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-07-03,WOW..  I can&#39;t say when last I watched a movie so beautifully made like this. Really enjoyed it. Roman was truly a friend in time of need. Sacrificed his own life for his friend.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-07-03,Gerard Butler &amp; Denzel Washington needs to do an action movie together.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-07-03,Gerald Butler never disappoints he‚Äôs one of my favorite actors. When I see his name in a movie before I even watch the trailer I‚Äôm always giving it a 10/10
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-16,"When you see a movie preview with Gerard Butler, you know the movie will be great. I can&#39;t wait to watch this movie."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-09-04,Actually the critics were wrong about this one‚Ä¶great movie and Gerard Butler is one of my favorite action heros
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-05-24,"I&#39;m from Kandahar, Afghanistan and seeing the title sort of left me stunned."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-12,"Goosebumps when I saw Ali Fazal at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHs6z9RPGtA&amp;t=71"">1:11</a>. üôèüëç"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-04,"Gerard never disappoints, excited for some more action!"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-05-27,"Saw KANDAHAR opening day and theatre was half full before noon. Great action! Terrifying scenes, kept you in suspense all the way through. You don&#39;t know how it will end. GO SEE KANDAHAR! You will not forget this movie!!!!"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-05-16,"Just saw Kandahar early screening &amp; it was<br>3. Bahador Foladi, Navid Neghban, Gerard Butler, Travis Fimmel &amp; Ali Fazal give superb performances. Cinematography is amazing &amp; an all-around great movie &amp; supporting cast!! Shout out to the special effects department!!"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2025-04-18,"Kandahar and the covenant by far the best rescue film ever, watched many times but i will keep watch whenever i felt like it"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-10,I am definitely going to the theaters for this. Nowhere else would it be a justice.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2024-05-27,"One of the best aspects of this movie is the saddest: the many factions involved in what makes the Middle East sooo unstable, extending beyond culture but the unfortunate reality of terrible ppl in power from Iran, India, Russia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan. It‚Äôs unreal, and how the writers illustrate that on screen in such a short time is brilliant."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-11,In Cricket = Jos Buttler<br>In Cinema = Gerard Butler<br><br><br><br>Never Disappoint
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-05-18,Just watched the early release in the movies. Adrenaline through the movie. Really well done. And at the end i really like that they did not end after the action scene but for the main actors showed the aftermath in their lives.<br><br>Overall one of the best action movies i have in years!
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-18,"Plane was great, and count me in opening night to watch this. Keep &#39;em coming Gerard!"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2025-03-13,My beautiful homeland Afghanistan üá¶üá´ ‚ù§been through so much trauma and pain lately but it‚Äôs still the best feeling ever to have it in my heart
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-14,After I got out of the Marines I spent about 4 years in Afghan doing private security. A lot of that was around Kandahar. Cant wait to see this movie. I miss it most days.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-16,Gerald Butler &amp; Clive Owen are 2 of the most underrated actors ever...would love to see them in one movie together
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-13,This is another movie to make us believe that the people of Afghanistan are the bad guys and that the military intervention of other countries is completely justified.
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-11-27,Travis Fimmel Ragnar!! Finally good to see him in  another movie such a good actor

Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-07-20,"Watched KANDAHAR today on my Blu-ray copy. Although I knew what the story was, I have to say it is so much more! It&#39;s very powerful. So much going on in that part of the world. This Gerard Butler movie is much more than him blowing things up which I&#39;ve heard his critics say. Take another look and try to understand. It&#39;s eye opening. Thanks GB! üòä‚ù§"

Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-05,"In reality, Americans left their pants while fleeing Kandahar (Afghanistan)"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-12-13,"Me encanta la palabra Kandahar, suena como un lugar fant√°stico, Kabul tambi√©n me encanta, es como la historia de un pueblo que habito alli desde los albores mismos de la humanidad y se defendieron con piedras y palos."

Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-15,Interesting fact. The roots of Kandhar are linked with Mahabharata. It&#39;s a thousands of years old city. One of the main character named as Gandhari was the princess of Kandhar..Now it&#39;s in Afghanistan. In those days it was all Bharatvarsha..
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-14,Some one should do the same thing during Manhattan Project üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-11-05,"It&#39;s a pretty decent action movie. Not the best I&#39;ve seen lately, sure, but definetely not the worst. That place is taken by Extraction 2, that somehow managed to get better ratings than this one."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-12,"Wow, i want to watch this movie on theatre ‚ù§"
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-30,"It&#39;s okay to satisfy yourself with a movie rather in reality..... Kandhar, The kingdom of Wolves."

Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2025-03-28,"Interesting cast...So a preacher, a spartan, and a viking walk into a bar.."
Kandahar,WHs6z9RPGtA,2023-04-04,"Wow that guy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHs6z9RPGtA&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> has the most perfect white teeth ever he should be doing toothpaste commercials I am jealous of how beautiful white his teeth are get him to the toothpaste companies they will all want him to be their spokesman."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-25,"I don&#39;t remember the last time a trailer hit me so hard. the conviction she had when saying she won&#39;t hide in the cellar. I immediately broke down crying. <br><br>Helen is THE person to play Golda, one of the most iconic people in history"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-16,Suddenly this movie is very relevant now
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-24,Helen Mirren is at the apex of her craft. No other female artist comes close. She makes others look like they are ‚Äúacting‚Äù.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-25,"Helen Mirren could literally read the ingredients on a can of tuna....OSCAR! Her portrayal of Meir is haunting and yes, she&#39;s that great of an actress. I can&#39;t wait for this film to be released."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-09,Helen &amp; Liev a match made in heaven!! The trailer is stunning! Why can‚Äôt the big theatres play such spellbinding action packed intelligent movies longer?! I guess I answered that question with the words fact finding history that needs to be told. The truth shall set you free!!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-04,I&#39;m crying over a trailer!! Helen be blessed. You played the Queen and now you played a queen again. She was a force to be reckoned with. ‚ù§ the &quot;right to left&quot; line!!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-01,When is Liev going to get an Oscar already - the guy is phenomenal.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-26,"Helen Mirren delivers again and again. If the film is good, she will be deserving of some awards, maybe an oscar."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-31,"Spot-on performance. No one will ever agree with all the details and motivations portrayed in any movie based on such a volatile history, but Helen once again showed her metal in portraying a tough old leader in an impossible position."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-23,"I saw this as a play in Toronto many years ago, and the strangest thing happen. At the very end, the silence in the audience was overwhelming, and as if planned and rehearsed, the entire audience began singing Hatikvah and the applause that followed lasted for several minutes. I hope this happens in the theatres. Helen Mirren is certainly made to look like Golda, that I had shivers going up and down my back!  Except for voice, (impossible to duplicate), she looks, dresses and walks like Golda!! Another Academy Award, that is if Barbie doesn&#39;t take it!!! Never can predict the Academy voters, some of whom are outspoken antisemitics/antiisrael."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-12-23,"Helen Mirren deserves an Oscar. It&#39;s such an important thought provoking film, about all involved, not just centered on Israel. She is the type of people in the world, that I wonder the most importantly about. Come from poverty, great adversity, into the role of great leaders. The destinies of their souls. Just have to think that God has something to do with them all."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-21,Looks like a masterpiece with incredible Helen Mirren‚ù§
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-27,I love these kind of movies about 70s political turmoil. Mirren is so good at playing formidable older ladies
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-25,"This is a damn good trailer. I like how the background music is Leonard Cohen‚Äôs rendition of a famous prayer recited on Yom Kippur, because of the Yom Kippur War"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-26,"She acts amazingly.  She looks like Golda, walks like Golda and talks like her. Nobody could have come close to her acting in this movie.  She deserves getting the Oscar . Absolutely."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-27,"Helen Mirren is still going strong. Now with wonderfull prostethics on her face. <br>Can we give dat Dame just a oscar, bafta etc. every year? Because the quality of her work is always good, even when the movie is not very best (I don&#39;t judge about this one before I have seen it). She gives even te simple&#39;s, boring movie a brilliant extra touch. I don&#39;t know how. Sometimes it&#39;s her joy, sometimes it&#39;s just damn good acting, sometimes both..<br>Buth please Dame Helen Mirren, don&#39;t die and keep acting."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-11-16,This is an amazing film and Helen Mirren is superb!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-10,Couldn&#39;t have chosen a better actress to play Golda Meir! Can&#39;t wait for it!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-26,I love watching historical epic and biopic films. Golda is one of them.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-07,"as Egyptian, this actress was very professional and capable for acting as real Golda 100%, i liked this movie which showed the truth without lies"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-25,Looks like HELEN MIRREN will win an Oscar for best actress üòâ
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-29,"I realize it&#39;s tough to do, but a little authenticity in her accent would make this add so much to the realism of her character.  A phenomenal portrayal of a phenomenal human otherwise."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-02,Very good movie. Actress in Golda is a true high performer. Worthy to watch!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2024-01-08,This is a high quality movie!! I saw the whole thing!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-12-04,"Give her the Oscar now ,simply outstanding"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-25,This is quite good. I only wish they added elements of Golda&#39;s leadership during the Munich hostage crisis and her decisive role in hunting down the minds behind that horrific tragedy. I wished to see more than what was just a passing role in Munich (2005).
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-28,"I‚Äôve been waiting for Golda ever since I saw Dame Hellen Mirren in makeup, three or so years ago. I think this is going to be a masterpiece."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-25,"What really matters is good-will, more than talent, fame and everything,  good-hearts, good intentions and of course love, that&#39;s what we need, that&#39;s what this world needs. the biggest problem of this world is the lack of good-will in common and from now on my kindness will show up."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-31,"A movie that needed to be made. A leader that ought to be taught, emulated, and remembered. A nation that disappeared from the face of the earth for two millennia, but never stopped fighting for its existence. I can&#39;t wait to see this."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-13,"And the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role goes to......... Helen Mirren, for &quot;Golda&quot;. IT&#39;S IN THE BAG !"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-23,"God bless Israel, God bless Golda Meir<br>good diplomacy on Kissinger&#39;s part!<br>Golda&#39;s two aces - 2x Mirage 2000s with nuclear warheads - targets - Cairo &amp; Damascus .............never again"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-07-28,"Wow, regardless of how you feel about Israeli politics... that was one moving trailer. Damn. I got chills."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-26,"I know of Golda Meir, but but not much about her, or too much about Israel beyond what I&#39;ve learned from a few Israeli friends.  Will check it out!"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2024-08-16,All the respect to the Egyptian military
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-25,"I am very happy to see that her life is being shown in a movie. Being an Indian, I&#39;m thankful to her for providing arms to us, when US and UK sent nuclear subs on our shores. <br>She helped us when everyone else had turned their backs on us (except Russia). This was during the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-18,"I think if you gonna watch this film and you&#39;re not From israel or egypt, you also need to know the other part of the story and know more about mohamed anwar elsadat ( the egyptian leader at that time)"
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-24,2nd Oscar for Helen Mirren. The first for the Queen of England....the second for the Queen of Israelüôèüôèüôè
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-30,Excellent timing!!?
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-27,"I am Israeli. I took place in our Yom Kippur&quot; war as a soldier. As a woman I&#39;m sure that Golda was an iron woman,an icon.a lioness. We over came the war only thanks to her leadership.  If someone else had been a Prime Minister then, we would have been in a great problem.  Nobody came close to Golda those days. Hellen Mirran acts incredible as Golda. She is an actress Top Class and she deserves getting the Oscar. RIP Golda! Rest in peace ! Hellen Mirran Bravo big time!!!"

Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-29,amazing trailer and i love the song &lt;3
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2024-03-23,"The new movie &#39;Golda&#39; will bring back memories of when the whole world teetered in 1973 on the brink of Islamic conquest, not just of Israel, but of secular T√ºrkiye &amp; Egypt, but if Israel fell then there would have been rapid expansion into Cyprus, Hellas and then the Balkans. Australia would have faced a new probability, a radical &amp; aggressive Islamic Indonesia. Thankfully, her will prevailed."
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-03,This movie realy drove home how devastating the losses of the Yom Kippur War were.

Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-23,Has everyone forgotten Ingrid Bergman?  Astonishing.  Very moving.  And she had the deep voice.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2024-08-15,This movie is real because it&#39;s just acting<br>After all Isreal humanity is just an act not real <br>So it make sense
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-07,one of the best trailers I have ever seen!!
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-10-03,"Firstly, I am proud of this film for showing the extent of the strength and solidity of the Egyptian army and what it truly did of courage, bravery and defeat of the enemy in the October War of 1973. Secondly, this work contains an incorrect idea about Egypt stopping firing due to the siege of the Third Army. The real reason is that the enemy does not  He had his own equipment due to the pain inflicted on him by the great Egyptian army and the huge loss of weapons and equipment, but with the help of America at the time and its supply, there was a line called the Supply Line, which transported American weapons and equipment of a modern nature and superior capabilities.  Which was not present with the Egyptian army at the time. This is the real reason why Egypt accepted the ceasefire and handed over the Jewish families, and also why the movie did not show what happened to him when he tried to enter the cities of Ismailia and Suez. When they were trying to enter the city, the civilians were confronting and destroying the tanks like destroying toys.  Small town.  Note: The Jewish prisoners were sent to Sadat in their underwear and pajamas, the Castor nightwear.  Finally, this film shows the extent of the Egyptian army‚Äôs oppression of the Israelis and the extent of the very deep pain that befell the army. Finally, long live Nasr for its army and its people. The Egyptian army will remain subjugating every enemy no matter how many years pass and no matter what happens to obscure the truth after 50 years üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>◊™◊ó◊ô ◊û◊¶◊®◊ô◊ô◊ù<br>ÿ™ÿ≠Ÿäÿß ŸÖÿµÿ± ‚ù§‚ù§üá™üá¨‚ù§‚ù§"

Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-08-22,They have to go all the way back to 1973 to find a time when Israel was not the aggressor.  They should make a movie about the brutality of their occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.  Or the Deir Yassin Massacre.   Or the Sabra and shatila Massacre.  Or the Kfar Qasem Massacre.<br><br>This is a transparent attempt to draw a parallel with Zelensky and the war in Ukraine at a time when support for the war is on the wayne.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-11-05,MiRren is fantastico‚ù§
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2023-09-02,It was excellent I saw it today.
Golda,unW5w6JCEb8,2024-06-11,"I just got out of the movie and I normally never write comments on movie trailers but this one hit me so deeply in so many ways that I need to leave a comment here. It was one of the best, if not the best movie I‚Äòve ever seen. It‚Äòs haunting, it‚Äòs painful, it‚Äòs real, it‚Äòs pure tension and simply genius cinematography. It shows the pure horrors of war, without ever showing a single actual war scene. It‚Äòs all in the sounds, the voices of the soldiers, the peoples pain and in the incredible acting. And there is so much humanity, so much realness, tenderness and hope as well. What we see isn‚Äòt a glorified portrait of an Israeli leader, it is the sad reality of human beings with too much responsibility to shoulder, who have to make an impossible decision and live with the consequences of that for the rest of their life. There is not one moment, where the viewer gets to forget, that those divisions talked about in the war room, are real people and that every single one dying is too much. The crushing fear of the total destruction of Israel is palpable in every moment, just like the pain over having to send young people to die for its security. And in the end fight, in which the IDF wins over the Egyptian army, it is impossible not to imagine the cries of the Egyptian soldiers sounding just like the ones of the Israeli ones. The whole movie made me understand Israeli realities, history and perspectives way better, without it feeling like a propaganda movie, which some might probably fear. <br>I so wish the end of the movie would have been the end of this conflict. Seeing how much the movie mirrored current politics and knowing people have been dying like this for 50 more years after the Yom Kippur war and are still continuing to, is even harder to stomach, after that movie has managed to give you a glimpse into the reality of war. In the end, what the real Golda Meir said to Sadat at that press conference will probably stay with me forever: <br>‚ÄûWhen asked, many years ago, when I thought that peace would come to this region to our country and to our neighbouring countries - I said: I do not know the date, but I do know under what conditions it will come - when there will be a leader, a great leader of an Arab country. He will wake up one morning and feel sorry for his own people, for his own sons who have fallen in battle, and that day will be the beginning of peace between us.<br><br>Mr. President, we have a saying in Hebrew: &quot;zchut rishonim.&quot; In English, this means &quot;the privilege of being the first.&quot; I congratulate you, Mr. President, that you are privileged to be the first great Arab leader of the greatest country among our neighbours to come to us, with courage and determination, despite so many difficulties, for the sake of your sons, as well as for the sake of our; for the sake of all mothers who mourn sons that fell in battle. No mother should have to give birth to a son in the fear that he may fall in battle. For the sake of all our sons and all our children, not only those who are alive today but also those to be born in future generations - you have come to us and said: let us have peace; let the war of 1973 be the last war between us.‚Äú<br><br>If anyone is interested, you should read the whole speech, or better even, watch it. It gives great insight into a lot of things about Israel. <br><br>Thank you Guy Nattiv and everyone involved, for such an amazing movie. The world really needed this."

This is exactly what it&#39;s like.

It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-27,Oh wow! This looks fresh seen from an Indian perspective of horror! Cinema is definitely opening up to the horrors of all cultures. Big up!!!!üéâüéâüéâ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2024-09-09,"Insanely good movie! 100% worth the watch! watched it last night with a bunch of friends we all really enjoyed it.<br>Only downside to the stream we watched was there was zero english subtitles for all the Hindi parts so we just had no clue what was being said :( but otherwise very very good, love that more horror films are diving into more folk lore of other cultures!"
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-07-28,"My mum&#39;s side of the family is from Gujarat, and even thinking about how this demon exists in mythology gave me chills. It was brilliant how they have incorporated mythology into films, though it scares me to think about it."

It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-05-01,This horror movie is the only horror movie I trust that is gonna deliver the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù. All these scary movies that have been releasing these past few years have been shit and are never scary at all but this movie definitely gives ‚Äúlights out‚Äù vibes so I know it‚Äôs gonna be good.
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-28,This year is officially the new Golden Age of Horror
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-09-08,I&#39;m glad these possession films are starting to look more like psychological horror rather than just the exorcism. I&#39;m gonna be comparing this to Talk to Me very hard when it comes out though because for me; that film is my new peak for possession horror.
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2024-07-13,"I love that there is an exploration of another culture, finally! It was entertaining, not the best movie, but decent."
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-05-06,"When we were kids even my mom used to tell me a story, not of demons but of Lord Hanuman, Krishna, Shiva, Bhagath sing, etc... <br>Appreciate the effort they put in because it&#39;s not easy to make a movie about Indian culture and systems without proper understanding. Be it Bhoot, Preta, Pishaci, Rakshasa Or Asura Hanuman got us covered. If anyone is in any kind of problem just ask him with true devotion he&#39;ll be there."
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-26,Movie looks nice and quiet unique too.. Great performances with some Indian elements... looks interesting üòä

It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-05-08,"its about time there&#39;s a horror movie with a middle eastern/indian family and protagonist. Im not even indian, im black, but to see this is refreshing. No hate to white people or anything, im just sick of seeing the same caricature of characters in these horror movies. Also, the concept of this movie reminds me of &quot;it follows&quot;. Anyone seen that one?"
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-09-07,"This year has been amazing with horror films. I love elevated horror. Not just jumpscares, but an underline story of grief with creepy as music and visionary. Hereditary was the start for me with these movies. I was mainly a slasher fan. Can‚Äôt wait for Thanksgiving to come out."
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-26,Another movie im expecting to watch. üéâ
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-29,"I love that we&#39;re getting more horror from other cultures, a treasure trove of folklore"
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-05-22,gotta say that visual of the boyfriend bouncing around like a puppet really freaked me out. looks like a really cool movie!

It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-04-26,Damn the thing that was inside the closet reminds me that time I was searching for my dog in backyard around 2:00 am. I thought I saw my dog inside bushes near the shed but no it was strange shadow  looking at me with glowing eyes just like the thing in the closet. The reason I knew it wasn&#39;t my dog because I got near the bushes nothing was there.
It Lives Inside,a5xUbuYHdi8,2023-07-25,Interesting concept. I&#39;ve listened to a lot of myths and cryptid stories from around the world and India has quite a few freaky folk tales and entities that could adapt for really frightening horror stories. We don&#39;t usually hear about horror movies with an Indian background so this has potential

Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"So, Kate Siegel is now officially our horror psychological thriller genre Q U E E N"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate Siegel is getting the kind of recognition she deserves.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,That actress should be labeled the netflix scream queen. She‚Äôs in like every horror movie.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-29,"A movie about helping with anxiety, that gives you more anxiety."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-28,Pov your in the comments looking for actual opinions on the film but everyone just on about the actress üò©
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"she was SO good in hush, she‚Äôs def going to be good in this movie too"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,It‚Äôs a yes from me if it stars Kate Siegel and it‚Äôs just in time for Halloween which is great. Thanks Netflix!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate Siegel is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses. She commits and it shows.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-09,After seeing her in Hush I&#39;ll watch her in anything. I&#39;ve also jsut started watching Midnight Mass and she&#39;s realy good in it. Not to mention The Haunting of Hill House. Hope Netlix continues to make a stuff with her.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-24,"‚ÄúAn idea planted in the mind will blossom into a whole new reality‚Äù Ahhh, so it‚Äôs Inception!"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I always loved Kate Siegel. I hope she&#39;s gonna stick to her husband&#39;s creations as well because I love everything he does. Such a power couple. Can&#39;t wait to see her!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I&#39;ll watch anything with Kate Siegel in it at this point tbh.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Not gonna lie these Thriller Movies/Series have been doing great on Netflix in a while.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-11-01,"It wasn‚Äôt as good as I had hoped. I think they could have done more with this. It was ok, but had potential to be really good."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-06,She is great and I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs getting all these roles. I‚Äôm happy her husband brought out and showed the world how much talent she has.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-06,She looks like Angelina Jolie‚Äôs long lost sister. She‚Äôs beautiful and talented.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Finally people are recognizing Kate Siegel&#39;s talent !!! Knew she was something else since Hush!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate&#39;s starring I&#39;m sold.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-29,"The characters are well written and the plot was solid. I&#39;ve seen many psychological horrors so FOR ME I felt the movie was overly predictable.  That said, the movie still held my interest throughout the story line and had the appropriate dramatic musical overtones needed to &quot;sell the scene&quot;.  Over all I&#39;d give it a solid 8 out of 10 because of it&#39;s plot fluidity,  character charisma and musical influence."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-09,it&#39;s clearly been a good year or 2 for Kate Siegel. she&#39;s literally in almost every movie and show I&#39;ve been watching of late
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,She was incredible in Hush.  I‚Äôll watch anything she‚Äôs in.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"her husband puts her in everything, shes really good though so well deserved."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"Everyone‚Äôs talking about Kate Siegel, I‚Äôm just excited for my guy Dul√© Hill hahahah"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-09,Midnight Mass is also amazing she‚Äôs dominating Netflix
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-06,I like how she goes from horror project to the next. She‚Äôs really good in that genre
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I bet there&#39;s a scene in this movie where she has blood on her hands and then disappears in a blink of an eye.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,This reminds me of False Memory by Dean Koontz.  One of the most psychologically scary books I&#39;ve ever read.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-06,She‚Äôs the certified thriller/horror/psycho actress.  Been liking her performance since Hush.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-11-01,"She looks like Angelina Jolie üòç<br>Plus I loved this movie, awesome watch!!"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-28,"<b>Dule Hill turning to her</b> &quot;You hear about hypnosis? That&#39;s messed up, right?&quot;"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,She‚Äôs an excellent actress! I‚Äôm stoked for this.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I see Kate Siegel. I click. Horror/thrillers with her in it is everything!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"Oh my, I hadn&#39;t realised that I&#39;ve watched most of what Kate&#39;s been in. She&#39;s one fine actress without a speck of doubt"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-11-14,Kate Siegel is such a good and sort of an underrated actress really. She also kinda looks like Gal Gadot and Angelina Jolie&#39;s sister
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-31,This was a really good watch. I say this with love... there is plenty of material in this for an absolutely hysterical SNL skit. üòâ
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Dul√© Hill is getting more mainstream recognition. I love that!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate is my favourite since The Haunting of Hill House. Glad to see her doing movies now.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate Siegel aka our fav thriller/ suspense queen getting the recognition she so rightfully deserves! YES YES YES üôåüèº ‚ù§Ô∏èüî• Can‚Äôt wait for this!!!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-07,"Netflix, make a documentary about the actual real work of that hypnotherapy does too! This actually promotes fear about seeking psychotherapy."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2022-08-25,"SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL , HER FACE IS SO FRESH , AND THE ACTING IS üëå"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate Siegel has been killing it since Hush. Amazing actress
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Why is Gus pretending to be a cop?
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Only Netflix knows how to entertain and educate the audience regarding psychological matters. Love you Netflix.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-11-01,"&quot;You can wake up now&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;Ten more minutes, pweaseee.... it&#39;s Monday, I don&#39;t wanna wake up early....&quot; :V"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-30,"It was okay, not too bad, not too good. I would rate it about a 6.5/10 because it wasn&#39;t boring, the music and the pace were okay. Yes, the lead actress was better than all the other cast members, but the plot could&#39;ve been more intense. It&#39;s still good for those times where you want to chill at home and watch something"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Is this like that Charmed episode where Prue is being controlled in her dreams by that dude in a wheelchair
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Her performances in hush and hill house were incredible. Still have to watch midnight mass and now I have this to look forward to as well.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Kate Siegel in all the Flanagan directed horror shows on Netflix makes sense since she&#39;s his wife but I&#39;m happy to see her cast in something separate from him!
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-30,"When a movie is rated solely on the actor, there&#39;s something wrong there."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-20,It feels like Kate Siegel has became the Horror/Thriller Queen with all of her movies/series on Netflix.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,When the trailers hype us a movie so much the expectations can&#39;t live up. <br>They need to step back a bit with these edits.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"Remember her from Hush. Loved it. She was so good. This also looks very intriguing. Keegan Michael Key is now the official friend of lead character. Hope he gets a leading role movie or show, like a somber role."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I&#39;ve watched the movie HUSH like so many times and never get tired of it. Her acting was simply brilliant and I can&#39;t wait for this. Deff gonna give this a watch üëçüëç
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2023-03-12,I love to see Dule Hill in a thriller like this. He is such an underrated actor.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-11,"Love Kate from The haunting of hill house, Hush and Midnight Mass‚Ä¶glad to see more of her, she‚Äôs doing really good stuff"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,I just watched 3 web series of Kate siegel.. and honestly I am a big fan now.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-08,Thanks for showing everything that happens and leaving no mystery in this trailer. It saves me the time of actually watching the movie.
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-31,"Just finished watching this movie. <br><br>I liked Kate Seigel in her previous movies so that was a bit of an incentive for this one. A fine lady she is too.<br><br>The story is not bad &amp; the acting is also not bad. It is a really simple plot. No award-winning performances here though.<br><br>The suspense &amp; mystery builds up very slowly &amp; is limited after a while because everything is revealed &amp; the movie is about to end.<br><br>The movie is rather safe. It is not doing too much. In the hands of some other team, the idea could have been much better imo. <br>The potential is there but they played it safe.<br><br>The movie is short at 1h22. It left me on my appetite a bit. <br><br>I give it a thumbs up just because I am hypnotized right now."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-07,"I love seeing Jason O&#39;Mara show up as a bad guy. He&#39;s fine playing the good guy, I like him in everything. He made a Life on Mars remake work so he knows what he&#39;s doing as the lead of a series. He just seems to slide into that psychopath role that much easier. Not sure what that says about him. I think it&#39;s his effortless charm and cool and he can make almost any dialogue sound like the most threatening thing ever while smiling the whole time. Especially in a smaller role like in The Closer. He was only there for a couple of episodes so he could really lean into it and you&#39;re never sure what he&#39;s thinking or what he might do. Looks like an incredibly unsettling series. I look forward to watching it."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-27,This woman is a mixture of Angelina Jolie and Megan Fox üòä

Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-06,Netflix should get award for showing the entire story of a movie which is about 2 hours in 2 minutes üëèüëèüëèüëè
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-07,"Conceptually it‚Äôs interesting but realistically it‚Äôs pretty inaccurate. Hypnotism isn‚Äôt a mind control device. It can‚Äôt make someone go against their moral code. Many professional psychologists, psychiatrists, hypnotists etc have said that."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-11-03,"Hypnosis for real is AMAZING, and YouTube is full of self-hypnosis videos. It&#39;s a good movie, but it&#39;s creating a negative and distorted image of what hypnotherapy really is :)"
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,"as someone who did hypnosis for 26 years, I can tell you this is as far from real as you can get. We can never &quot;implant&quot; a memory/suggestion and we can never make you do anything you don&#39;t actually want to do. That stuff you see on stage is people just pretending and wanting to be a part of the &quot;act&quot;.<br>What hypnosis ACTUALLY is helpfully used for is relaxation and stress relief. It can also be helpful for anxiety and trying to recall memories. But that&#39;s literally about as far as it goes.<br><br>Now watch how many commenters come after this saying it did &quot;freaky things to them&quot;."
Hypnotic,eHsWYmnXk1o,2021-10-05,Does Siegel&#39;s agent just refuse to send her any happy scripts LOL.

Not bad for a show but I could&#39;ve stayed home and watched it with headphones at full volume on Youtube instead, also it&#39;s not something I&#39;ll go see again.

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,Colm Meaney sold me on this.  I will watch nearly anything he is in.  Miles O&#39;Brien!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,Hope this &quot;noir&quot; is in the same league as &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Chinatown.&quot;  It looks very promising.

Watching this brought be back to 2012 playing Rockstar&#39;s La Noire for the xbox 360. This was well acted and well shot, a very authentic period piece."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-08,Marlowe is gonna be a classic Hollywood noir!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-19,"The presence of Danny Huston should be highly appreciated by some..; and nice to see him in another feature with Jessica Lange after the stunning show, AHS Covent&amp;Freakshow."

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-24,"FINALLY!  Excellent role for the formidable Liam Neeson and great cast too, I can&#39;t get enough of Diane Kruger &amp; Jessica Lange, and of course Danny Huston the bad guy(par excellence) and Alan Cumming(I adore). Great classic Film Noir, I think Chandler would approve, and the cherry on top, directed by Neil Jordan.....can&#39;t wait to see it."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-26,"Excited, I have been in need for another LA noire type of movie"

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2024-01-03,Yes Liam Neeson &amp; Jessica Lange  also Diane Kruger  are good reasons to see this movie. They are always good in anything they do. But i also would like to say that Danny Huston is another reason to see this movie. I think he is a good actor.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-22,"I would love it if he ever showed up in his original suit:  I was wearing my light blue suit with a dark blue shirt and tie, black socks and shoes&quot;  (The Big Sleep, page 1)"

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-08,Finally a non action Liam Neeson film.

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,JESSICA LANGE YOUR THIRD OSCAR IS COMING üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ QUEEN
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-06-23,"It wouldn&#39;t be fair to judge a movie by the trailer so all I&#39;m commenting on is a very vague first impression. Neeson&#39;s few lines didn&#39;t seem like my idea of Marlowe, but Neeson is usually a terrific actor and Marlowe is the kind of character who can be interpreted a lot of different ways, which is why several very different actors have played him well. Couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s based on anything Raymond Chandler actually wrote; if it isn&#39;t, there&#39;s less of a chance that Marlowe was written in a way that&#39;s true to his character. I&#39;ll wait for this one to be available on video and then give it a fair chance."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-04,"Adored Marlowe books as a teenager, sadly this movie from what I&#39;m reading from those who watched it isn&#39;t doing Marlowe any justice. It just isn&#39;t Marlowe."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,"It is very very far from Raymond Chandler :(<br>Philip Marlowe always fights with words not fists or weapons. Liam Neeson is simply doesn&#39;t fit in this role in spite of he is a great actor."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-17,"incredibly well written , suspense action thriller . The cast are perfect for the rolls . Neesen didn&#39;t disappoint"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-14,Wow!  Look a that cast!  And Neil Jordan? Sold.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2024-07-24,"I have seen it on my tablette,marvelousNeeson,great,super actor,‚ù§‚ù§"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,Cannot wait for this movie
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-22,Jessica üòç... My queen.  lol   Of course I will be seeing this!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-22,I‚Äôll wait until it‚Äôs available to stream.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-13,Looks good‚Ä¶like the style!!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-18,Great cast...Hopefully going to see this one real soon.  üòÄ
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-19,"With due respect, Liam Neeson seems badly cast for this role, if it is supposed to based on the Raymond Chandler stories. For one thing, Neeson is waaay too old, I&#39;m sorry to say. Looks and moves like a 60+ year old, which he is; Chandler&#39;s Marlowe is maybe 40 at most. More than just age, Neeson&#39;s persona doesn&#39;t generally convey the edginess and wary+weary personality of Chandler&#39;s Marlowe. A Tom Hardy, in contrast, I could definitely see as Marlowe."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2024-05-30,the trailer is very good and the film is even better
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2024-05-30,Marlowe is a great of great films
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-21,Thank you
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-16,Very Cool Trailer!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-15,"Going to be hard to play a character that Humphrey Bogart played perfectly, but it&#39;s nice to see Phil Marlowe back on the big screen"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-09,I never miss to watch all liam neeson movieü´°ü´°
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-07-02,this was a great movie and gets a 10/10
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-06-02,They say Batman and Superman are far fetched but Marlowe refusing to bonk Clare Cavendish is way too unbelievable script writing.

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-08,"Here&#39;s a movie idea. Let&#39;s hire Liam Neeson and make it just like every other movie of his except we&#39;ll set it in the 1930&#39;s, they&#39;ll still watch it. <br><br>Yeah I probably will."

Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-17,jessica lange üíú
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-13,I love Liam Neeson from Iraq üáÆüá∂
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-13,JESSICA LANG‚ú®üíú
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-15,I was named after the detective. This is nothing like the black and white tv show where you get the P.O.V of what Philip sees throughout the show.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-07-04,How come i never heard about this movie?
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-04,"Uncanny, I was just thinking about film noir and this just pops up on my feed.  It&#39;s like the algorithm is reading minds now"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,Would have been awesome to film it in black and white.<br>Liam Neeson... I&#39;m not sure. ü§î
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-18,"In this trailer, Neeson reminds me of a Nick Nolte role, &amp; Jordan looks like he wants to use Marlowe as a vehicle to do his take on Polanski&#39;s Chinatown, but anyway...in keeping with my tradition of checking out all Marlowe &amp; Holmes depictions on screen, I&#39;ll check it out, no doubt, but you know: machine guns, explosions etc. doesn&#39;t seem right in a Marlowe, as much as a Holmes, story. Could be this goes all out for entertainment like the Downey Jr.Holmes, but I doubt it. I expect Jordan won&#39;t be able to do a noir type character study, but he&#39;ll probably revel in a bit of underworld dodginess to give this film a bit to his taste"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-08,"Man I don&#39;t want a noir because nearly everybody dies by the end, but that cast though!"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-19,Here for Jessica Lange
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-06-17,"Does anyone know the name of the song which is playing from the gramophone? Starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brVF7t8VYuM&amp;t=25"">00:25</a>"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,"The color grading is a crime. I don&#39;t mind a good noir, but I object to a cut rate one."
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-15,Great cast and Neil Jordan directing. HAS to be good.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-19,Say less and take my money give this  movie a wide release
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-12,I didn‚Äôt realize Woman had such extensive Plastic Surgery in the 1940‚Äôs
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-14,ENSERIO HABER COMO LE HACEN PERO QUEREMOS VER ESA PEL√çCULA AQU√ç EN M√âXICO... POR FAVOR HAGANLO POSIBLE ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫‚ú® enserio gastar√≠a mi dinero cu√°ntas veces fuera con tal de ver a Liam Neeson en un personaje violento pero uuuusssshhhhh m√°s cl√°sico‚ú®ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-08-17,Liam neeson was like a private eye I&#39;m a walk among the tombstones as well
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-03-07,finally!!! a crime noir
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-13,jessica! my love!
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-08,"Get this, and get it straight: Crime is a sucker&#39;s road, and those who travel it wind up in the gutter, the prison, or the grave"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-21,"I&#39;m very intrigued.  This looks like a lot of fun. That said, (based on a 2 min trailer, mind you) it doesn&#39;t quite &quot;feel&quot; like Chandler&#39;s Marlowe.  It seems to lack the notable witty banter that Marlowe was known for.  Neeson doesn&#39;t quite seem have the right disposition and sense of sarcasm to embody Marlowe the way that, say, Bogart was able to. (Again, it&#39;s only a 2 min trailer.) Also in the Big Sleep Marlowe was 33 years old. Placing his age in the late 30&#39;s as no older than 37 years old. Liam Neeson is 70. Big difference. <br><br>Having said all that, it seems like the filmmakers are creating a fresh spin on the character. (Which is good. There was only one Chandler after all).  It seems like they are going for a more straight-forward, gritty type of adaption.  And I&#39;m intrigued. I definitely plan to see this movie. I&#39;m curious how it will stack up and to see what direction they go.  So I&#39;m gonna go in with an open mind  These types of movies rarely get made anymore, so I&#39;m gonna try to just to appreciate it for what it is. (As opposed to what it could be or what it isn&#39;t.)"
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-01-13,Is this based on any Chandler novel in particular or is this an original story involving Marlowe?
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-12-16,Is it worth watching low ratings but usually a big Liam fan.
Marlowe,brVF7t8VYuM,2023-02-23,is there a release date yet?
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-22,"This was filmed at my actual camp, which unfortunately closed. Although it wasn&#39;t a theater camp, this movie totally captures the essence of who we were and I can&#39;t wait for the world to see it. I&#39;m so glad Kutz is preserved forever!"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,Saw it at Sundance. This movie feels like it was made specifically for me. And yet like it could have wide appeal. I can‚Äôt wait to see it again.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,"The cast is made up of extremely talented and underrated actors, wow!"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-08-08,"I watched this movie in theaters recently and it was honestly one of the best things I‚Äôve ever seen, as a theater kid this is the best representation of my theater experiences and the movie honestly made me cry, the atmosphere and people you would meet have been perfectly captured and I am honestly so sad that more people aren‚Äôt talking about it."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-19,"As someone who went to theatre camp in their youth, then onto drama school, this looks incredible üòÇ"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-23,"That first bit with the secret to getting the kids attention is 100% accurate.  The exact thing happened when I was a counselor at summer camp -- we had a couple of different call and response methods for getting the kids attention that I was familiar with but the new art director wasn&#39;t.  He was unsuccessfully trying to get their attention, then I dropped in with the call and response gag and they were all focused.  The new art director was like &#39;what was that?&#39;"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,This is Ben Platt‚Äôs apology for Dear Evan Hansen.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-08-08,"One of the most fun movies in quite a while! It‚Äôs not just fun but filled with hearts. Also shout out to the kid that delivered ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt look okay‚Äù line, it‚Äôs honestly gold! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puVDIUk0kM8&amp;t=111"">1:51</a>"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,"I can already tell this will be the most unhinged movie I&#39;ve ever seen, and I&#39;m so ready for it!!!"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-07-31,Former hs theater kid here that went for 2 summers at a camp for choir music.(Almost like theater camp) This movie brought a lot of nostalgia. You will root for the kids in the end!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-22,If this group of actors were a friend group I‚Äôd want to be in this friend group so badly
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,Truly an anthem to all of us theater kids!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,"Film looks FUN! I was a HH Camper &amp; Junior Camp Counselor from 1962-1969. When I arrived as a camper at 8 years old, HH was just gaining traction. Liz Bernard was a young, sophisticated NYC redhead with a revolutionary vision of what Summer Day Camp could be. Man, she made it happen! As teen campers, we had &quot;Cotillion&quot;. We lucky guy campers held pretty teenage girl campers in our arms, as we danced together for an hour - while our younger sibblings hid behind the gym doors and tittered."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-22,"As a former (and let‚Äôs be honest, forever) theater kid, I am certain this is going to wreck me with good emotions"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,It‚Äôs Camp 2003 for the younger generation and I love it.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-06-27,"just saw this at a mystery movie night, and it was incredible!! it was a total love letter/hate mail and completely hilarious. the entire audience burst into raucous laughter multiple times. 5 stars! the entire cast did an amazing job and it was a sincere love letter to theater and the arts, and made me think lovingly and cringely at my own time at orchestra camp as a youth."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2024-01-08,"This movie is an absolute love letter to theatre, and I can&#39;t recommend it enough. Every detail is perfect."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-19,They filmed this at the camp that changed my life for the better in 1975. I&#39;m going to have to go see this!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-23,"I am 14 days from the start of my 9-year-old theatre kid&#39;s first 3 week musical theatre sleep-away camp. Just from the trailer, I can totally see my kid in those portrayals. Wish it opened before his camp, will settle for watching Camp (2003) again before it. Hope there are some stars that rise from this like Anna Kendrick from the Camp movie."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-07-31,Ayo Edebiri has been in so many things lately I‚Äôm happy for her!!!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,I‚Äôm so happy this is getting a theatrical release! Can‚Äôt wait to watch it many times with my fellow musical theatre fiends. Let‚Äôs make this our own Marvel Universe.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-20,"This film was shot in Warwick, NY, on the site of a camp - The UAHC Milton and Hattie Kutz Camp Institute for Living Judaism - that I virtually lived at, on and off, from 1969 to just a few years ago. I went there as a participant, worked there, taught there, sent my children there. <br>They have changed very little from what it was like throughtout those many years. <br>Many of my dear friends who are now community leaders, clergy, and educators will remember those surroundings with a sweet fondness."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-06-12,This looks so good! As an actress who‚Äôs worked at countless theatre camps (literally working at one in 2 weeks) I‚Äôm screaming at this!!! üòÇ
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,one of my favs from sundance can‚Äôt wait to see this again with an audience
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-19,"This looks amazing! And ‚ÄúOh, What a Beautiful Mornin‚Äù is one of my favorite show tunes, so if someone started singing that around me I would definitely join in like the kids did üòÇüòÇ"
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-19,This actually looks like a lot of fun.  Interested to see it when it comes out.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-25,This is what happens when kids who grew up watching Camp make a movie and I am HERE FOR IT!!!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-12-22,My favorite line: &quot;Get her and her knockoff Chanel bag out of here!&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-22,I saw this at Sundance. It was hilarious! Can‚Äôt wait for everyone to see it.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,Wet Hot American Summer walked so Theater Camp could run. I&#39;m here for it.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-06-15,I saw this at Sundance and honestly I wasn‚Äôt excited because I‚Äôm not a huge Ben platt fan but I am a former theater kid so I was intrigued. It is honestly one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time and filled me with nostalgia for my theater kid days. I highly recommend people go see it!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-09-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puVDIUk0kM8&amp;t=111"">1:51</a> ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look okay!‚Äù Gets me every time I don‚Äôt know why I like that but so much."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-19,This looks genuinely hilarious and veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrry relatable to a grown theatre kid. üòÇ
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-22,I remember being in theater in high school. Best experience of my life.

Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-07-30,"This movie is for anyone who has been a theatre kid, a theatre teacher, had anything to do with youth theatre....SO many IN Jokes. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s brilliant cinema, but it sure is a lot of fun . Also, the kids...a whole lot of talent."
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-09-14,This looks like an incredibly accurate depiction of the theatre world.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-07-14,Holy crap I was just rewatching American Vandal LAST NIGHT! Jimmy Tatro is a genius and now I&#39;m very excited for this.

Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-08-24,The confusing thing was I saw this preview in a theater in the Adirondacks and when the guy yells at the beginning ‚ÄòWhat up Adirondacks‚Äô I was like what happened to the movie previews? Looks hilarious though and thrilled that a movie takes place in the Adirondacks

Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2024-09-17,One of the funniest and warmest films I‚Äôve seen in a long while
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-06-08,As one of the few people who saw Camp in theatres (and pegged Anna Kendrick as a future star) I am really glad they are handling this with a better movie.
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-05-18,If Camp (2003) had a naughty sibling.

Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-06-08,This is basically every theater kid &amp; stage crew ever!
Theater Camp,puVDIUk0kM8,2023-07-15,"Just saw this in a crowded theater (many theater kids) &amp; it absolutely killed! Had me in stitches (especially for someone who has never been to theater camp). Very funny through &amp; through. Very much a &quot;Best in Show&quot; type film which I loved, but the kids stole the show. Easily one if not the funniest film of the year, hands down. Highly recommended &amp; worth your time if you want laughs ü§£"

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-12-11,"Sandra‚Äôs performance is sheer art. The intention of the film is to confuse you or doubt who did it or what happened and she portrays that with such ease. One minute you think: ‚ÄúOMG look at her, she‚Äôs 100% guilty‚Äù and a minute later you think: ‚ÄúOMG look at her, poor her, it‚Äôs impossible‚Äù and all that with just one look."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-01-22,When I first saw this trailer I thought it was a documentary on a true story.  The acting is phenomenal.  Wow is all I can think to say.
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-03-11,"Every single performance in this movie is Oscar worthy... Sandra, the judge, the little boy, even the dog"
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-12-12,Quite possibly the greatest court room drama ever committed to film. Sandra H√ºller takes your breath away. She is definitely getting Oscar nominated for this role. In fact she deserves to win.
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-04,"This is hands down one of those movies that are worth to watch if you like mystery/thriller. This movie has an intense feel to it in a different level. No intense music, no jumpscare, no fear to induce. But it was wild for me."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-11-03,I practically held my breath for the entire film. Riveting. Maybe best court room drama of all time because you don‚Äôt notice it.

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-11,"In my erudite opinion, the coveted Oscar for Best Actor ought to be bestowed upon the illustrious canine, Snoop, from the cinematic masterpiece &quot;Anatomy of a Fall.&quot; Having viewed the film recently, I found Snoop&#39;s performance to be remarkably natural and professional. Even amidst the dire circumstances of ingesting a plethora of aspirin, his portrayal remained authentic, a testament to his consummate skill. I ardently propose his nomination, as his depiction undeniably elevated the film to the realm of true artistic brilliance."

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-08-18,"damn, this looks good. also a perfect example of why we don‚Äôt need to keep making movies and tv shows about ACTUAL monsters whose names deserve to be forgotten, just make a fictional story as if it‚Äôs based on real events."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-11,"Good movie. It held your interest. Interesting how they turn everything into a clue while you don&#39;t know where it points to. The characterization is the real essence of the movie, with the mother as the cold egotistical father, the father as the self-appointed woe is me mother, the lawyer as the amorous unrequited suitor shmuck, and the kid as just plain creepy. Nobody else got that vibe? And while everyone was focused on the mother whom they did not particularly like, or the father who obviously was tired thanklessly giving to this world, nobody was looking at the blind kid who could do just about anything and eventually poisoned his dog.<br>The mother made the world revolve around her, also regarding her partner&#39;s death. Selfish, cold, unwavering. When she ceased being the centre of attention she felt the let down of her court victory. The father did need a change to what he had set up, but he was also full of excuses and self pity for his lack of professional action. Violent, manipulative, passive aggressive. If he is a writer, why is he drowning the household with loud music? There was a court appointed guardian, and I don&#39;t have a real opinion about her. She saved the dog, assisted in barring the mother from her own home, abandoned the kid quite a bit for the guardian of a blind boy. The only likeable character was the dog. And as with all black sheep, he was duly punished for his noble babysitter duties by being overdosed by his charge. I can&#39;t forget the exhausted look of the herder barely managing to walk behind the son, then leaving him to eventually place himself in bed with the mother instead. The father is dead. The mother was on trial. The lawyer and babysitter go home alone, and the dog made his choice where it was safe to rest. I think we all know by this time there was more to the poisoning/suicide story than what the characters had said. It&#39;s not what you say. We&#39;re watching what you do."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-08-19,Sandra is definitely getting an Oscar nom

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-12,"The French Alps are magnificent.  It could have been a masterpiece with Hitchcock at the helm.  Instead, it seems that the creators stood around a cauldron abs threw whatever happened to be laying around into the brew.   Ambiguous French films that ask you to create the plot.  Snoop is a legend.  Woof!"

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-08-17,Was waiting for this trailer.looks good!!!
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-15,"My guess points :<br>1. The mother is guilty<br>2. The child lied at the beginning during the reenactment to protect his mother (he changed his mind)<br>3. he lied again at the end of the trial, my perspective is seeing the director&#39;s way of conveying it with the way the father speaks in his son&#39;s voice, making it look like a lie being voiced by his son<br>4. maybe with the long trial process, he thought that rather than losing both of his parents, he chose to lie (as his guard said: it&#39;s better to decide by speaking as if it were true)<br>5. At the end of the film, the child kisses his mother as if the child is protecting his mother and his mother thanks him without saying it, because his mother seems to have a high ego when listening to the recording (with the flashback)"

Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-09-12,"this is the kind of movie that&#39;s called real monstrous. but, what&#39;s make this more terrifying is the SUICIDE helpline in the description."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2025-01-12,this whole film puts the whole French justice system into question. Sandra was being treated unfairly the entire trail. The judge was biased. The kid&#39;s protector who were not allowed to take about anything related to the case was projecting her own opinion of the case onto the kid while his own mother couldn&#39;t say anything at all. This is absurd.
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-01-19,Too many movies about the mental destruction that relationships have on men. The line between information and entertainment is getting blurred and I hope people are beginning to learn. Especially men.
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2023-12-25,"IMO, Sandra really did kill Samuel and her kid didnt want to lose another parent. End of."
Anatomy of a Fall,FUXawkH-ONM,2024-02-04,This trailer gives too many clues away. As do many modern trailers
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-29,"After watching this movie, went to the restroom and as I walked to the sink to wash my hands, a lady asked if anyone had just seen Left Behind. I said I did! She was BEAMING as she said at the end of the movie, her husband of 8 years prayed to receive Christ! Hallelujah!! Neither of them will be left behind!"
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-12-20,"My only concern with this trailer is the quote, &quot;Cause I asked God to leave me behind.&quot; I just wrote a blog about that very thing only a few days ago. Asking God to leave us behind to help evangelize the world is the same as saying that we don&#39;t trust that God has everything under control... that somehow our presence is necessary to continue spreading the salvation message after the Rapture. If that were true, then the Rapture wouldn&#39;t be necessary. We could all just stay to evangelize the world. But that&#39;s not what God has planned. God is preparing 144,000 converted Jewish evangelists PLUS He&#39;s sending the Two Witnesses. Yes, with our limited human intellect, it may seem logical to ask that we be left behind, but we&#39;re not thinking as God thinks. We think small. God has a wedding feast planned for us, and for us to say, &quot;You know what, Father? I think I can be better used here on earth during the Tribulation, so thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Really? I know that the line is taken completely out of context, so I&#39;m going to wait to see the movie before I make any judgments."
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2024-03-25,"I watched the movie, it was so awesome.  I am a Christian but it made me reaffirm my belief in the Lord."
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-11-21,"I will trust in Jesus even though I‚Äôm struggling, I will never lose hope. Jesus is the only light in this world. I pray God will continue to protect me and my children. As a single mother things are difficult on me. My husband passed years ago I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm overwhelmed at times because both of my children are autistic. I‚Äôm struggling trying to support them and myself because like so many others. I lost my job as a social worker at Forsyth hospital because I declined the vaccine. I declined because of my pre existing health condition lupus and heart disease. I was denied my medical/religious exemption. I wish I could go back to the hospital but the mandate is still in place for hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. I‚Äôm waitressing and I‚Äôm so thankful to be working again, but I‚Äôm not making nearly enough to make ends meet. I get harassed and called names for simply asking for prayers, but prayers are all we need. Thankfully God gives me strength to keep going. I have faith God will provide. He HAS THIS FAR. WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! Please pray for me and my children."
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-11-21,"&quot;It&#39;s still so easy to dismiss it, even though we saw it with our own eyes&quot; what a great line.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-08-30,"And here I was JUST 10 MINUTES AGO telling my wife that I wanted to revisit the Left Behind movie because it&#39;s getting more real than ever before. Perfect timing! Our human life is but a vapor, a morning mist. It&#39;s hear and it&#39;s gone. But when we die, we go to ONE of only TWO places. Jesus died that and gave us free will so we could either choose to repent and accept HIM as both LORD and SAVIOR or to choose ourselves as LORD. We must al choose. Like Joshua who said, &quot;Choose you this day whom you will serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!&quot;"
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-28,"A friend went to see this movie tonight. She said it was really good. Interestingly enough, there is no billboard to advertise the movie like other movies are. I am going to see it tomorrow"
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-11-27,"Cannot wait for the Lord Jesus Christ to come and finally take us home. As it is said &quot;The Day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.&quot; Thanks to Jesus Christ for still offering this opportunity to mankind to receive forgiveness from God, because of what you did on the cross, and then rose up on the third day to go to the Father and prepare a place for us, so we may be taken there as well! So beautiful is the work of Christ that I cannot wait for this to finally happen."

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-04-01,"It‚Äôs such a relief to see a new Christian eschatological film that doesn‚Äôt look like a high school film project.<br><br>I am a big fan of the left behind film series, I remember watching the original three when they came out and I was disappointed when they decided to cancel the original film series after the third one. I hope they actually manage to get enough sequels to cover the entire book of revelations. I think Kevin Sorbo did a fantastic job with this film, I‚Äôm sure any sequel he makes will be just as good.<br><br>Here‚Äôs my review<br><br>Pros:<br>- Great acting by everyone <br>-For the most part it‚Äôs biblically accurate <br>-Great choreography<br>-Despite not having a big budget, the film looks good enough that  it could be a TV series<br>- Covers a lot of the book of revelations <br>-Great messages throughout the film<br>-The Buck character is interesting because he is a morally good character but is only able to piece things together when realizes that the Bible is true.<br><br><br><br><br>Cons:<br>-The world doesn‚Äôt look dystopian enough, even though the ‚ÄúAC‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have full control of the world in this movie, a post rapture world should look a lot more gloomy and frightening.<br>-The main antagonist has superpowers for some reason. The problem with the Nicholai Carpathia character is that he has superpowers, his only power should be his charisma which allows him to acquire totalitarian control of the world because he is only the ‚ÄúAC‚Äù not a demonic entity.<br><br>Overall I give this movie an 8.9/10."
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-19,This could be really good. Kevin Sorbo and an excellent cast with Neal McDonough (who&#39;s a devout Catholic) as the Anti-Christ is just too delicious to miss.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-11,"On 12/31 I had an extremely vivid Left Behind Rapture Dream. I was standing in a parking lot outside of some tiny little church and there were 2 little girls that suddenly shot up into the air. I was so excited that I was about to be raptured, but then I looked up into the sky and I could see people from all over the world flying across the sky from left to right. We could hear them expressing utter joy and laughter. Everyone on the ground didn&#39;t say a single word but we were all just looking up in total shock. Those people around me didn&#39;t know Anything about the Rapture or they were always taught by the church that it would not happen during their lifetime, or there was only a mid-trib rapture. As the moments turned into minutes I started to realize that I was a Foolish Virgin. Ever since the Revelation 12 Sign, back in September 2017 I have been anticipating the Rapture to happen almost every single month for over 5 years now. I even quit my job and have been living as a minimalist off of my 401K. The Lord showed me through this dream, that I have been out of Oil since Dec 15th; when I was about to drive out of state for a week to spend alone time just reading my Bible and praying. My Pastor called me up and was yelling and screaming at me because he found out that I had just bought a Menorah for Hanukkah, because I don&#39;t celebrate Xmas. He quoted off a ton of scriptures to show me that my soul was now in jeopardy by my trampoline everything that Christ did to bring in a New Covenant. He said by me now trying to observe a single Jewish traditions, I now must observe all 613 perfectly! He wouldn&#39;t let me talk or explain that I don&#39;t observe Hanukkah the way that the Jewish people do. I&#39;m sure they have a very specific way that they light the candles, certain prayers that they say, and scriptures that they read, songs that they sing, etc. I don&#39;t know about that, I simply read through 40 New Testament verses regarding the LIGHT of Christ shining through our TEMPLE.<br>I try to forgive him several times a day every day... which only confirms that I still haven&#39;t completely forgiven him. I&#39;ve been back in town for over a week now but I haven&#39;t let anyone from my little church know that. The Pastor has turned the whole church against me so I know that if I were to go back I would have a whole list of others that I would need to forgive as well. So because I do not want to be left behind I am not going to go back to that church that is filled with gossip and backbiting. We&#39;re just too close to let any relationship take us to Hell.<br>The most terrifying verse to me this year has been Romans 11:25: <br>I don&#39;t want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited. Israel has experienced a hardening in part UNTIL the full number of the Gentiles has come in.  So the moral of the story is if we do not forgive others of their sins, your Father in Heaven will not forgive us of our sins!

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2024-09-23,Great movie. Praying many souls who see it will be saved from the tribulation. üôèüôèüôè<br>The only thing that puzzles me is that all children are gone. Buck said he didn‚Äôt really know anyone who disappeared. I find it hard to believe he didn‚Äôt have family or friends who lost their children. Families will be distraught to say the least.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-10-15,"With the tensions between Israel and Palestine that are escalating out of control, it seems like we&#39;re living in the end times and the second coming of Jesus Christ is getting more closer.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-11-18,This looks like it might rock.
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2022-12-01,They&#39;re are a few inaccuracies here. One is the fact that the pastor said &quot;he was left behind because he told God to leave him behind.&quot;<br><br>When the Rapture happens God will leave no Christians behind. No matter if you plead with him about it or not. And most importantly it would be insanity to even ask God that. No one left behind is gaurneteed to live 30 seconds in the tribulation. There&#39;s no gaurnetee you would survive the beginning let alone the full 7 years.<br><br>And 2- a second vanishing? There is no secound vanishing. There is one Rapture and it happens before the tribulation starts. And at the end of the tribulation Jesus descends to earth to end the battle at armageddon and defeat the Anti-Christ.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2024-03-19,Might as well listen to the audio book instead that‚Äôs more interesting.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-17,Also not to mention that‚Äôs not why the pastor was left behind. He wasn‚Äôt a true believer in the book. He was a pastor but didn‚Äôt truly believe‚Ä¶.the authors were show how it‚Äôs easy to deceive even your own self.
Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,dFlu7dmHQ_g,2023-01-29,"Good movie, especially for the saved. They get Revelation right, Bible quotes and some personal testimony at the end to boot.

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-22,I&#39;ll always watch Toni Collette
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2025-04-28,"I was pleasantly surprised that this movie is good. I enjoyed watching every minute of it. Toni Collette played a remarkable job as a God Father. I never thought Monica Bellucci would ever be in a mafia movie until this came out. The plot is mysteriously thrilling, the dialog is funny, and the Italian scenery is beautiful. For any God Father movie fan out there, this is a must see mafia movie."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-30,I love Toni Colette. Yes please.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-02-28,I can&#39;t wait to watch this. The duo of Toni &amp; Monica on screen together is intriguing but please Bleecker street give Mafia Mamma a decent theatrical release and decent promotion. I hope it can be successful on the release date you choose.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-12,Watching this today! Monica Belluci aged so graceful my goodness üòçüòç
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-06-20,I can watch Toni Collette&#39;s any movie again and again with happiness and joy....she is a legend in acting..an actress par excellence....I big fan of Toni from Pakistan
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-21,Here for Monica Bellucci... she is timeless.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-04,"Just saw it at a special showing.  It was actually pretty good!  Good laughs, great scenery and I wasn‚Äôt bored - though, I thoroughly expected to be.  Surprisingly fun date movie!"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-02-19,"Just watched it! An absolute blast from start to finish! It was hilarious, had badass action scenes, a relatable lead with a great arc, and universal themes with the beautiful backdrop of Italy! I absolutely loved it!! Toni and Monica were great together and the guy who played the love interest is the hottest guy I‚Äôve ever seen!"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-28,Can&#39;t wait to this one! Love Toni ‚ù§
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-16,I just saw this movie. It&#39;s hilarious üòÇ. If you&#39;re one of those people that likes simple easy to follow lightheaded comedies you will love this

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-07,Monica Bellucci could still 100%
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-04,I never would have expected Monica Bellucci  to be in a movie like this...
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-17,Loved it!! My new classic Comedy ‚ù§
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-09-24,"I would love to have this movie on Busy Moms TV, my husband and I watched it together and both loved it!"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-06-10,OMG. THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNYüòÇüòÇüòÇ I LOVED IT!!
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-02-28,This looks good but I feel that April 14th or the month of April is not a good release date for Mafia Mamma. the month of May is more suitable and doesn&#39;t have a lot of movies releasing on that month. But we will see if Mafia Mamma can have a nice box office run in April. I look forward to Mafia Mamma.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-12,"Oh my God !!! It has been a while since I watched a great movie , I just saw it today and it was amazing !!! Super funny ! I recommended!! I will probably watch it  again with my friends ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-12,just seen this movie early today and i liked it
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-14,"Just saw it I loved it! It looks a little silly but the comedy kinda helped it! Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a guys kinda night movie, maybe something to watch with your mom or gal pals"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-08-01,Monica Bellouci is in it. YES!!!!

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-31,I will make you a muffin you can&#39;t refuse.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-16,"Very entertaining movie! I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. A light, funny, quick couple of hours, or however long it was (I didn&#39;t even check the clock because it never lagged and travelled well...and I always check the clock). Attention was played to detail, to artfully use the subordinate characters (the &quot;cousins&quot;) in many individual moments to further the comedic mood. Well done. Good choices of focus, not overplaying the atomic family&#39;s purpose as her setup. Great turnaround on the usual &quot;romcom&quot; when the heroine decides meh, what was all that really all about anyway? Good move. And her new female confidante calls her mio amore instead. The editing was perfection. Each scene had purpose and did not overrun. For such a simple concept, they used their resources nearly the best way you could. It never set out to change the world, but in its arena it doesn&#39;t disappoint. Hollywood needs to use their playbook because this is how it&#39;s done. Imagine what could be done if this had been a script meant to change the world...what could have been made with these hands. Speaking of which, the film referenced Eat Pray Love a lot, but unlike EPL this film did not overdo the &quot;first life&quot;, did not drag, was not melancholic and depressing, and packed a more enlightened monkish moksha (freedom) message even though it was set in a comedic version of The Godfather that it also so often referenced."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-18,I have the same reaction when anyone tells me they haven‚Äôt seen the Godfather.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-31,"I admit, I&#39;d watch this one."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-11-29,"Ignore the the &#39;trusted reviewers&quot;  this movie is a lot of fun on Amazon prime. Yes, it&#39;s a bit rough around the edges, but it&#39;s got quite a few laughs that make it a surprise and easy viewing. Had this movie a little more spit and polish and a tighter script, it could have been magical. Better still, I could easily imagine this as a  TV show."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-05,Best Movie ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-15,I really loved it ‚ù§

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-08-22,"Very Funny Movie, I&#39;ve fully enjoyed"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-08-20,I went to the cinema 33 times last yr &amp; didn‚Äôt see a single trailer for this film‚Ä¶ üò≥üò≥
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-03,"This looks GOOD!   Yes, I want to watch!"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-20,This is either going to be hysterical or terrible. There&#39;s no air can be anything in the middle
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2025-04-23,"I got about 15min into it, fast forwarded when the blonde was speaking, couldnt take it &amp; stopped the movie.  Life is too short to be tortured like that.   What a shame for the rest of the cast that had to work with her, my heart goes out to them."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-18,"Ooo its fun  movie. Right down to the  brutal parts...  :) So nice to see a movie that isn&#39;t Woke  BS, just entertainment. People don&#39;t go to church to skip the preaching. Hollywood  (spelled Disney) needs to know people skip movies to avoid the Woke Joke. This was fair to women. They got quite a body count and we cheered for them!"

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-05,Woah this looks as good as Ghost Busters 2016!!
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-06-26,Wish i had a girlfriend to watch this with
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-01,Mamma Mafia sounds better
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-02-28,"If Hollywood claims to be againts stereotypes, then why are Italians still portrayed as criminals?"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-22,The premise for this film is similar to that episode of Fairly Odd Parents where Wanda briefly takes over as head of a mafia like waste disposal company when her dad goes out of commission.

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-05,I&#39;m wondering how it rates on the scale of profanity and any explicit sexual stuff. I really want to see this. It looks so funny but who I take with me will depend on how much of that is on screen.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-06-17,The marketers of this movie did a bad job they are terrible at their jobs<br>This movie was so good that it should be mainstream yet you can&#39;t even remember the name when you stop looking at it <br>And then movie was so good
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-06-03,"i love toni collette ,but i would not watch this unless someone payed me"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-14,Forget this film but anyway check out the brilliant clive owen film with monica bellucci called shoot em up (2007) pure action.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-14,This looks beyond terrible.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-16,"We saw this yesterday. I think if it wasn‚Äôt for the comedy it wasn‚Äôt as good as I expected. I loved the Italian scenery though.  Both main actress‚Äôs are getting very old &amp; it shows on the screen. Storyline was a bit unrealistic. I do love MB, I do hope she makes more movies. ‚ù§"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-07-14,"I just saw the movie, did she have them drink the wine that his blood spilled into at the end?!   That‚Äôs disgusting and evil, it‚Äôs cannibalism!  Sure, there were funny parts but way too much acceptance of masturbation, fornication, cussing, porn, and do whatever you want even if it‚Äôs bad"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-13,Who&#39;s the beautiful one with the long dark hair?
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-04,"Just saw an early screening of the movie. Pretty funny, the last 20 minutes kind of go off the rails.<br>I&#39;ll give one spoiler.... They drink a guy.<br><br>thats all I&#39;ll say"
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-20,oh mother is mothering yup
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-12-10,"How Toni Collette wanted this role is beyond me. The comedy is a forced I&#39;m a woman with more value, and I can be independent. Woop! I&#39;ve been watching this fantastic actress for decades and think her delivery and emotion are on a level only she can achieve. The plot is too thin outside of her finding romance after her husband had lost his mojo with only her. I pray it&#39;s not her production, because she is much more than this. A romcom first and foremost. Then messages about how she&#39;s found herself, then action. Not the best."
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-07,So much potential and yet it was sooo bad. The acting was terrible ( especially Monica Belluci ) aside from Toni Collette.
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-06,Very bad movie
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-05-05,Panzy movie for millennial&#39;s and mangia cakes that stare at their phones all day
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-16,E Toni<br>Eh Collette
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-01-14,"This movie was horrible, I felt so much second hand embarrassment and I‚Äôm actually quite pissed off That Hollywood still writes female characters like this.. And even more upset that Toni Collette would actually play this‚Ä¶"

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2024-06-23,this is a  unfunny feminist version of MARRIED TO THE MOB

Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-04-12,this looks friggin ridiculous!
Mafia Mamma,e2UNT1pLP6g,2023-03-05,"MEH‚Ä¶..Perhaps if they casted more prominent actors it would pull more people to watch. That‚Äôs the problem with most movies. In order to make money you gotta spend money and that requires a cast of actors who people recognize to get them (me) to leave my home to go watch a movie about the mafia. Then you gotta get half the Sopranos cast to star, which makes the film impossible to make which causes B list actors to star which in turn causes less people to go watch. Vicious circle. Tough to do but looks decent I must say/ üëèüèª"

The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-23,"Impeccable production, great visuals, and CGIs on Earth, the moon, and huge explosions. A classic sci-fi movie with many references to Odyssey 2001:Space Odyssey, The Meteor (1979), or Harmagedon (1998). You won&#39;t be surprised that in the movie&#39;s world order, the Western world seems so disorganized and subject to violence while China shows strong discipline and a leading edge."
The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-26,"There are no superheroes on our planet. Everyone is an ordinary person without name when the building collapsed. When the end comes, everyone has the opportunity to become a hero in protecting human civilization."

The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2025-01-07,"Unlike in western movies where disaster like these would be depicted as apocalyptic, inescapable, and humanity have to count on religion or some &quot;savior&quot; to save them, Chinese movies shows the &quot;indominable human spirit&quot; when humanity united."
The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-22,much better than AvatarÔºÅpretty sureÔºÅ
The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-26,"What Moss conveys in the final part of the film suggests that only crisis can bring humankind <a href=""http://together.it/"">together.It</a> is for this reason that Moss continues to create global crisis.The moos crisis forced human to abandon nuclear weapons so that human won&#39;t fight each other with them.Maybe this is a tragedy of <a href=""http://human.how/"">human.How</a> could we are finally forced to stand together?"

The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2024-04-12,"IMO this is the first mainland Chinese movie that could be considered a great movie. I love how it doesn&#39;t try to copy Hollywood, but takes a different direction with its depiction of collective heroism. The SFX are also awesome - maybe not as polished as top Hollywood productions, but not far off. It&#39;s become one of my favorite sci-fi movies along with Interstellar and Blade Runner."
The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-26,I cried on the first one. It was really good.

The Wandering Earth II,Yf3VreXwVpI,2023-01-30,"Als ich zum ersten Mal den Charme chinesischer Science-Fiction-Filme sah, die Heimat der Erde, √ºbertrieben Chinesen nicht absichtlich die Wirksamkeit Chinas, die Detonation der Atombombe wurde von Astronauten auf der ganzen Welt durchgef√ºhrt, besonders als der Kommandant die Astronauten seines eigenen Landes zusammenrief, ich verliebte mich in China und verliebte mich in Chinas breite Brust!

Spectacular performance from every actor/actress involved in this film. Teyana got in her emotional acting bag and outdid herself, ok? <b>&#39;hand claps x 1000&#39;</b>"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-04-04,"This movie is powerful, emotional and so real. Does not feel like acting. Saw it today and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it."
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-24,"Wow this trailer got me teared up! Speechless! Teyana Taylor...... It&#39;s like she&#39;s not even acting,  it&#39;s raw it&#39;s real, incredible talent! I gotta replay this again!"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-23,this is what representation looks like! this is a snapshot of what it‚Äôs like to be black in america. this seems so beautiful and tragic at the same time. I can already tell this will be a classic. focus features never misses!

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-03-11,From the opening moments of this trailer I could already tell that Teyana Taylors‚Äô performance in this film is going to be incredible. I wish nothing but success as she continues to embark on her journey as an actor. God bless her.
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-23,"Teyana is an powerful artist, ever since I heard she was going to be collaborating on this movie, I&#39;ve been excited to see her shine in theaters, can&#39;t wait for it!"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-23,I can‚Äôt wait to watch this. The actress is strikingly stunning! That little boy is a heart stealer! The story is real! ‚ù§

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-24,"Oh, i almost cried... This looks like will be a very precious movie, can&#39;t wait to came to Brazil&#39;s theaters"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-04-03,Super proud of Teyana Taylor. I remember when she was on my sweet sixteen. So seeing her in this role gives me chills. Seeing this on Saturday.
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-05-01,Crying my eyes out! There is nothing out there like this. Teyana Taylor is a triple threat and soon to be an Oscar winner with this performance. All the characters in this film are just so good! This is the kind of movie that leaves you with so many questions and a real desire to know what happened next. Great film‚ù§
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-06-04,I‚Äôve never teared up this much on anything on tv since ‚Äúwhen they see us‚Äù . Teyana is absolutely brilliant and super talented on this movie. I loved her before but now I love her even more and want to see her on many many many more movies. She came through
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-10-09,"I&#39;m a sci-fi person and action movie person.  BUT this movie had none of that and yet was the most exciting normal movie I ever watched!  This movie was incredible! Moving, thought provoking and a portrayal of an unlikely hero.  Two heroes in fact.  Inez and Lucky.<br>And the young men who portrayed both Terry&#39;s, esp. teenage Terry. outstanding acting!<br>What powerful and moving portrayals of people getting out of street life with out the grimey.  It was all about doing the right thing even though you don&#39;t have to take such a risk.  The true power of love that can be in a person even though it is not portrayed on the outside of a person.<br>Absolutely loved this movie.  The acting was spectacular.  Great job on this movie.  It was beautiful to watch.  It&#39;s a movie that will stick in your mind for the right reasons.‚òùüëç"

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-05-10,"Amazing movie. Truly epic. Reminds me of growing up in the 90s ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>The higher message is one of the prince and the pauper. Lost identity and finding the true self. Stripping back who you thought you were to reveal the truth. It‚Äôs deeper on so many levels. <br>It has the initial message about life , trauma, loss and love but that is just the surface. Deeper it asks the most fundamental question : who am I? <br><br>Love and light to all ‚ù§"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2024-11-28,I went to see this on a whim and was completely blown away. Felt like crying half of the time. Absolute master piece!

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-23,Now that&#39;s a movie
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-11-10,"Amazing movie. This was one of the best movie&#39;s I&#39;ve ever seen.  Really thoughtful script, acting, and great cinematography.    Oscar-winning potential you all did!  Keep up the good work:  I survived a religious cult, police brutality, child abuse (physical, mental, zexual). They system just spits us out and tosses us in the trash. The few that survive often can&#39;t even articulate the pain, or end up on drugs on in a grave.  The rest that survive may sellout. The remainder, tell the real stories.   In middle of editing my own movie, and I decided to take a break and watch this.   Signed:  Spice from Southern Hip Hop - The Dirty South Movie. Coming soon."

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-03-24,"I&#39;m a half Black and the absence of my black father and the broken black family I am from is the reason I am not more connected to my blackness and my heritage. My ROOTS. This lack of fathers in our communities needs to end, because it is robbing black children and mixed children of their families, roots, and confidence. This trailer made me cry. ü•∫üôè‚úùÔ∏è"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-03-30,I hope Teyanna gets the recognition she DESERVES

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-06-24,I just finished watching it and it was a great film! They don&#39;t make films like this anymore.  It kept my interest from start to finish.
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-04-25,"The sad reality is that if you miss this film (like I had to today because of my working hours ü§¨), it can be easily be dismissed as a depiction of life at the bottom. But I see a genuine work of cinema here."
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-04-24,What a great plot twist üçø great movie üé• üëèüèΩ

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-03-16,"This movie right this one is most definitely it. We to prison for something I did not do, and I fought for my kids until i got them back took me seven long years. Feb 08, 2023 i will never forget that day thanking god"
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-08-23,This was a great movie.
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-04-20,Very good character study.  Beautifully done.
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-28,"This looks very intriguing, very good. Amazing performances. Very good music."
A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-02-24,‚ù§ agreed about the Oscar comment. Definitely an Oscar in the future.‚ù§

A Thousand and One,wBM0_6JJw1s,2023-03-22,"I‚Äôm not gonna cry I‚Äôm not gonna cry, five seconds later üò≠"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,Why is David Harbour so good at playing characters who look like someone&#39;s dad yet be a badass at the same time? Him as Santa looks awesome!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,I love how pure Santa&#39;s heart is despite the killings. His two reasons to kill were 1) the girl asking for help was on the nice list and 2) everyone who put her family hostage were on the naughty list already. I really want to watch this!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,I never thought I‚Äôd be happy to watch a trailer where Santa goes all John Wick but now It brought a tear of joy to my eye.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-02-23,Every year from now on we need a new David Harbour Christmas action movie. This needs to become a serie!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,"It‚Äôs not the Christmas movie we need, it‚Äôs the Christmas movie we deserve"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,‚ÄúSeasons beatings‚Äù Sounds like a great song name.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,I bet that the creative team on this movie just said what If die hard was actually a Christmas movie and now we‚Äôre getting this masterpiece
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-26,"By far, the best christmas movie ever! The casts, plot, dialogue, action, it&#39;s all absolutely marvelous!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-15,"‚ÄúTime for some seasons beatings.‚Äù Is so campy, but delivered perfectly. This is going to be just one of those fun action comedy movies that everyone can tell the actors had a blast being apart of."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy seeing David Harbour as Santa so much. He works so well for the type of Santa they‚Äôre going for. Can‚Äôt wait for this!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-14,"I love how this goes from looking like a typical Christmas movie to turning into a grim, violent, and gruesome story. Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-08-13,"Fun, violent, and wholesome, it might not be a movie for the entire family, but it&#39;s the best christmas movie ever."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-11-02,Finally a violent Santa movie where he&#39;s the good guy instead of a deranged serial killer
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"Honestly I love this. Movies like this tend to be a psycho masquerading as Santa(silent night deadly night) or it&#39;s some sort of evil version like krampus. I love the idea that Santa just found himself in a house invasion, and is going to kick ass to protect the children.<br><br>I hope the reindeer get to do some cool shit too."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,At first I thought it was going to be your typical Christmas/horror movie. I was not expecting this. Looks good as hell.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-02-25,"This movie was exactly like I was expecting, AND I LOVED IT!! R-RATED ACTION PACKED!!!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"Honestly, it&#39;s like Santa&#39;s Slay but way more heroic. Those random gunners are also like the assassin group what Krampus always wanted to have. And that&#39;ll be nice to have a surprising plot twist for most fans"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,Seeing David Harbour as Santa Claus was something I didn&#39;t know I needed in my life until now...
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,We didnt ask for this movie but now we so want it! Bring it on!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-21,"Had the pleasure of working on the set behind the scenes,fantastic experience!!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,I didnt realise that so many of santas lines can be portrayed as pure evil. And i absolutely love it!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-12,"This looks like more of an action comedy than the slasher I was expecting, and I am here for it!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-13,I wanted to be mad about a Christmas movie trailer playing in October but this genuinely looks like a good movie and I love David Harbour
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-08,I absolutely loved this movie. It married die hard with home alone. I can‚Äôt wait until the sequel where they explain more on how he became Santa.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,It&#39;s kind of refreshing to see a Santa movie where he isn&#39;t just some mystical man or an evil monster. He&#39;s just a dude who loves his job (and knows how to kick ass because I&#39;m pretty sure he was viking in some legends)
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-11,Looks fun as hell. Finally something that isn‚Äôt about a evil Santa but just a bad ass Santa protecting a family from home invasion.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-07,"Based on the trailer alone I think we can reasonably state that this might be one of the, if not THE greatest Christmas film ever made üôÉ"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2024-09-29,I didn‚Äôt realize such a bloody film could make me tear up and genuinely feel the spirit of Christmas. Brilliant.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"This genuinely looks phenomenal. It‚Äôs like a funny idea that you‚Äôd say would never happen, but they‚Äôre actually doing it. Awesome."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,I had no idea how much I needed a film like this until I watched this trailer!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,Making Santa a vigilante is exactly the type of Christmas film we need.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-12-20,This movie had NO RIGHT to be as f#$%ING AMAZING as it was.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"This movie looks like it came out of nowhere, and it is the kind of movie people have been wanting for awhile. Something fun, fresh, original."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,I know John Leguizamo has played underrated villains but I have a feeling this is going to be awesome
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-09,"I love how he‚Äôs not just a guy dressed as Santa, he‚Äôs the real deal and he proves it multiple times.<br><br>Edit: Cool, lots of likes.<br><br>Edit: Cool, no more likes."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-12-09,This is the Santa that my kids will grow up with.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,This storyline is a breath of fresh air from all the repeat stories being told right now on the big screen.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"It looks campy, it looks cheesy, it looks kick-ass, and it looks like it&#39;s overall going to be a fun time."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,Is it weird to say that I had a huge smile on my face throughout this entire trailer
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-09,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a53e4HHnx_s&amp;t=97"">1:37</a> she invited weird kid to a party. I guess Santa really had to put that too huhüòÇ"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,"Loving the look of this movie. Humour, action and the aesthetic.<br>One to watch."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,"Gotta say, regardless of whether or not the movie looks any good, the first trailer for a Christmas movie I get every year makes me happy that we‚Äôre nearing the season."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,This movie actually has an original and refreshing premise. Love to see it.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-08,A cross between Die Hard 1 and Home Alone.  This movie was TOTALLY entertaining!!!  Loved it!  Two big thumbs up!  Awesome movie.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-07,I thought this would be a christmas slasher film but this actually looks hilarious and fun to watch
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-07,"Finally...a good, wholesome, and decent family Christmas film! We need more of those. ü§ó"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-11-04,This movie is a big middle finger to everyone who says Die Hard is not a Christmas movie and I‚Äôm here for it!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2024-11-10,"This is arguably the best Christmas action film ever made, and that includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon. It hit all the holiday notes, plus it had tons of action and comedy. This is an instant classic and is part of my holiday must watch list."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-07,"I saw this last night. It&#39;s so good.<br><br>It&#39;s violent and bloody, and yet somehow still an utterly sincere Christmas movie.<br><br>As Santa might say, it&#39;s Christmas magic, but I&#39;m not really sure how it works."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,I never imagined David Harbor as Santa Claus and now I can‚Äôt imagine anyone better to play him
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-03,This movie is great.  It manages to be heartwarming and violent at the same time.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-11-27,This movie was the definition of badass. It‚Äôs rated R but it‚Äôs just Santa messing up bad guys and I didn‚Äôt have any problem letting the kids watch it.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,Seeing Santa save the day from bad guys on his naughty list is definitely gonna be intense!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-04,"Saw this today. Was freaking awesome. <br><br>Fun. Properly paced. Good character dialogue. Great action. Santa had a perfect character arc. Knew what kind of movie it wanted to be, and f&#39;ing nailed it."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,&quot;Which one of you did that? Prancer? So UNPROFFESSIONAL!&quot;<br>I don&#39;t why but I love that Santa&#39;s line ü§£
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-22,This is like the first movie i watch on a date and fr. The gore and killing elements is the right mood for a date
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,This is 100% going to be the best Christmas movie to be released in years..
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-11-12,"This is the most off the wall amazing concept I&#39;ve seen in a holiday movie.  I may actually go to the theater for this one.  Thank you, Universal."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,"This looks like a really fun movie. Not so beyond over the top where it looks so bad it&#39;s good, but like it&#39;s actually good. I actually feel hype for this one."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2024-12-25,Make it a series .... Its Absolut Perfect ... David Harbour is amazing!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,This may not have been the Santa movie anyone asked for but you&#39;re not gonna get any complaints about the Santa movie we just got. This looks awesome as hell.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-14,"You knew what was coming when Santa says &quot;lump of coal,&quot; but what I didn&#39;t expect was David Harbour breaking the fourth wall when he says, &quot;I gotta watch.&quot;  This is going to a fun movie!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"This actually looks like a ton of fun, and perfect role for Harbour. Also great seeing John Leguizamo playing a proper villain again!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-22,&quot;I steer a little but the reindeers do most of the work&quot; LOLOLOL. It had me with that first joke. Can&#39;t wait to see this.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-09,I am so happy to see David doing more awesome flicks... amazing actor and this looks insanely entertaining kudos!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,This is exactly the movie I want to see.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,I am so pumped for this. Seeing David carrying his talent from stranger<br>Things to black widow to this will be exciting.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-03-09,One of the best Christmas movies ever.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-10,"This movie seriously looks amazing, props to whoever pitched this idea and landed it"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-02,"I just got home from seeing this, I love it. It was corny, heartwarming, funny, action packed &amp; gruesome. Honestly, go watch it."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-09,"At first I thought this was going to be a horror flick, but glad that it adding heavy violence but still keeping the spirit of Christmas."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-09,"This is a really good movie. It‚Äôs so much fun with lots of action. The perfect action Christmas movie with comedy but it also made me cry. I give it a 8.5/10. David Harbour does an incredible job, he‚Äôs such a good actor and he played a really good Santa. And since I love Home Alone, I also loved Violent Night. Home Alone 1 &amp; 2 are my all time favourite Christmas movies, so I really enjoyed Violent Night"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,Finally something wholesome for the holidays.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,The moment I heard the people behind Nobody and Bullet Train were behind this I knew this was going to be an awesome movie
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,Words can&#39;t describe quite how happy this trailer has made me.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2024-11-20,I love this movie so much. It was instantly added to my yearly Xmas movie rotation. David Harbour is a criminally underrated actor can‚Äôt wait for part 2!!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,"Not the Christmas movie we want, but the one we deserve....and want.<br><br>Yeah, I want this very much."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"I&#39;m so psyched for this movie! I love David Harbour in everything he does, especially in Stranger Things! He&#39;s just an incredible and versatile actor who deserves the world and more amazing roles like this, more action because this trailer kicks a whole lot of butt! We just need more of David in the future, that&#39;s all, so yeah, so psyched for this movie, December 2 can&#39;t come fast enough! This is not the movie we all wanted, but the one we all needed!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"Damn this came out of nowhere....David Harbour as a badass santa, just perfect for the holidays. Definitely putting this on the top of my watchlist üíØüëå‚ù§Ô∏èüí´"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-12-04,Lord accurate Santa was insane to see üòÇ former Viking Saint Nick
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"A movie destined to be a Christmas classic. The trailer is not selling a movie trying to be something that is not, it&#39;s selling exactly what people want for the holiday season, a fun adventure, but with blood, violence, and lots of action. I can see the writers pitching the idea to the producers: ‚ÄúJust picture a Die Hard movie, in a real Christmas setting with snow, eggnog, and a John Wick Santa Claus, starring the likable and charming David Harbour‚Äù."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-13,They couldn&#39;t have cast a more perfect actor to play Santa. David was born for this role. It&#39;s going to be a hit for sure.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,"This looks like a mix of Santa‚Äôs Slay, Die Hard, and The Christmas Chronicles. <br><br>And I‚Äôm all for it."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-18,just watched this movie at the cinema. absolutely brilliant! I didn&#39;t think such a gory film would make me feel so festive!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-11-05,"The Santa we all thought of as kids, a damn-straight hero."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,When she hugged Santa. I had a tear or 2 in my eye lol. This movie look super dope. I will most definitely be at the movies to see this.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a53e4HHnx_s&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> this scene brings me tears of joy."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-10,"After years of Die Hard being called a Christmas movie, we finally get a die hard style Christmas movie"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,I got Goosebumps!!!! The jolly christmas song and the violence!!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-09,The perfect movie to watch with your family during Christmas.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-08,John Leguizamo back in action! glad to see him still killing it on the big screen!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2024-11-27,Saw it in the theatres. Loved it. Watched it at home on Christmas Eve last year. Gonna do the same again this year. Safe to say Violent Night is a Christmas tradition in my house now.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,"This looks awesome. I loved both Nobody and Bullet Train, and seeing the producer is involved has me beyond hyped."
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-03,Omg this movie was sooo much fun! David Harbour was the perfect choice for Santa in this one and Edi Patterson did what she does best!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,"&quot;It&#39;s time for some season&#39;s beatings.&quot;<br>As an adult, I love a violent movie.<br><br>...and my mom loved to hear Darlene Love<br>at Christmas time, so this is extra special to me.<br>This trailer made me cry happy... I can&#39;t wait to see this!"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2023-12-31,Back.  This movie is now a Christmas classic as far as I&#39;m concerned.  David Harbour is a flawless Santa.
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-05,This looks crazy. David Harbour‚Äôs awesome!
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-12-05,"I don&#39;t know how this movie manages to be both stunningly creative in it&#39;s violence (Die Hard mixed with Home Alone is definitely is a perfect description if I&#39;ve ever heard one) and surprisingly heartwarming and sincere. It knows how to have fun while hitting you straight in the feels. Loved it, 10/10 would highly recommend :)"
Violent Night,a53e4HHnx_s,2022-10-06,"Not only it‚Äôs ridiculous, but it‚Äôs ridiculously funny as hell!üòÇ Definitely gonna try to watch this in the holiday."

What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,"I always her in liked French Kiss. Her character was a neurotic mess. Hilariously so.  Kevin Kline is hysterical in that.  My fave Meg is When Harry met Sally. This looks cute, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see. I&#39;m a fan of both and it makes sense to star them together as a past romantic couple."
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-09-01,"Wow!  This looks great!  And Meg Ryan directed it, that&#39;s so cool.  üòä"
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,I can&#39;t wait to see this! Also excellent use of that The Lightning Seeds song. üòä
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-10-13,The nostalgia alone will get my butt in the seat. But the movie actually seems sweet. ‚ù§
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-10-21,"After being a Movie Buff I quit going to movies because... Well, they&#39;re soo awful these days.  I&#39;ve waited for our darling Meg Ryan to come back on the sceen &amp; I couldn&#39;t be more happy.  One movie of hers that is less talked about is &#39;French Kiss&#39; with Kevin Kline.  A Sleeper I could see again &amp; again.  You go Meg!!"
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-31,I really really miss Meg&#39;s voice. This will be the first time I am old enough to watch her in a theater.
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-09-29,has a 90s feel to it which is why I know I am sure it is awesome !
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,She is back! Can&#39;t wait to see this movie!
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,I can think of no one more perfect to direct this.
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,Wow this looks great and very funny and a great romantic comedy i can&#39;t wait to see it and she looks great üòä‚ù§

What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-10-13,Love love Meg.  So glad to see her back. üéâüéâüéâ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,"This looks good. <br>It makes me sad that society forces women to feel like they have to hold back time with surgery. She was beautiful and she&#39;s still very attractive. She shouldn&#39;t have tried to &quot;correct&quot; her looks. They&#39;re unique.<br>I hope she has a bright future directing, writing, and acting. She deserves it. Duchovny is good (and looks good,) too."
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-12-10,Great example and life lesson of what happens when we get stuck in beliefs and how we can mess up our lives when we believe the wrong things.
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-08-30,cannot wait to watch this..Meg still makes every outfit her own..now i want a long coat and Dr Marten&#39;s boots
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-09-07,Oh my gosh!!!! This might actually be a good movie. If it‚Äôs in the theaters this might get me back in the mood for a night out movie. I haven‚Äôt set foot in a theater in 5 years.
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-09-01,That was Meg? Mother of GOD! What happened to her face? GEZASS!!!
What Happens Later,zceSigCGWSQ,2023-09-11,"Even if this gets mediocre reviews, I will go see it.  Most of the movies coming out are dark and depressing. Need a Meg uplift.  Clever with the background advertising inserted at :26.  A nod to Meg&#39;s kingdom?  Love it!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-01,"I just got back from seeing this film.  Amazing.  Touching, sad with a huge life lesson for all of us. I&#39;ve been a fan of Nighy for ages and he more than deserves an Academy Award nomincation for his role in this film."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-01,"Hopefully an Oscar nomination and a win for Mr Nighy, he enriches every movie he‚Äôs in and it will be totally deserved."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-06,"Bill Nighy has the ability to convey deep emotion without saying a word. His expression, demeanour, body language and the way he holds his gaze is masterful. A truly sublime actor. The trailer is a tantalising glimpse of what, I&#39;m sure, will be a superb film....."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-12,‚ÄúBill Nighy in a role for which he will be remembered‚Äù- which can be said for every movie he‚Äôs been a part of.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-29,I love every performance by Bill Nighy. I&#39;m glad he is being recognized in such a big way for this film and for his amazing career.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-07-11,"Every now and again, a film comes out and brings a tear to your eye. So beautifully made and acted by everyone. For me, the scene with the policeman brought me comfort. Thank you."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-05,"Everything about this movie was so emotional ,a life lesson for all . Bill Nighy was superb ."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-02,Just saw Love Actually (again) over the holidays. Bill Nighy in that movie and now this. I bow down in respect to this absolute master of his craft !üôè
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-07,Wonderful film. Sad but also very uplifting. Everyone in the cast was terrific but especially Bill Nighy.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-15,The remake and reverent homage to Ishiguro‚Äôs ‚ÄòLiving‚Äô with screen play by Kashuo Ishiguro! Oh I do hope so much that Bill Nighy wins the Oscar for his flawless and sensitive performance.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-14,"This looks wonderful.  Akira Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Ikiru,&quot; on which this film is based, is a beautiful and moving film, one of the three or four best I&#39;ve ever seen in my life."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-08-28,"Bill Nighy outstanding and great, the whole cast wonderful. What great actors we are lucky to have in the UK. Film 10 out of 10."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-02,"Bill Nighy an amazing actor a master of his trade, cannot wait to see this film ‚ù§"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-23,"I know as much as I will enjoy this, it&#39;s going to rip my heart out and kick it across the room."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-13,Just discovered Bill Nightly in the book shop and pride. What an undiscovered gem.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-10,There is more emotion and heart in this trailer than in most of the entire movies I&#39;ve seen over the past 10 years. This film looks amazing and the acting impeccable. What a treat‚ù§.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-03,"As the greatest fan of Akira Kurosawa for more than 5 decades, I simply cannot wait to watch this soon-to-be another masterpiece!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-02,I have loved him in every movie! Can‚Äôt wait to see this.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-28,"Bill Nighy.... The British Actor who sums up British acting. A voice to die for. Have a listen to him as Charles Paris in the Radio Drama, absolutely wonderful, especially if you like late 60s/70s music. I know that whenever he leaves this mortal world I will cry for the loss of one of the Great Actors of the last 50 plus years.<br>Who else looks so good in a lounge suit other than Bill Nighy ü§îüòÅüòÅ"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-08,This had me bawling lol.  A brilliant film and I&#39;m out of words for Bill Nighy.. he is just excellent!! 11/10
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-07-16,Just watched this film tonight. What a beautiful movie. Very emotional at the end. British film making at its best. Absolute 10 out of 10. <br>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-09,"Bill Nighy could read the weather and I would be totally engrossed. And then to add Tom Burke and Alex Sharpe? Well, even better. This looks amazingly beautiful and heartfelt. Can&#39;t wait!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-28,A really wonderful movie with a poignant and moving performance by Bill Nighy as a man making up for lost time. He fully deserves his Best Actor Oscar nomination
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-07,"Bill Nighy has a skill, able to reach into that little of my heart that aches, often able to bring gently quiet tears."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-02,Bill Nighy is a treasure.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-05,Living life to the fullest and finding your purpose is the message I&#39;m taking from this film üé©üñ§
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-25,"I am in love with this trailer! It&#39;s so beautiful, whimsical and heartfelt."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-06-30,"Thank you so much for this cinematherapy...it was much needed.  Have to admit I cried like a baby...it was so, so moving..."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-12,I just finished this. It was lovely. I had a few cries. üò¢üòä
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-02,"...and those of us who feel we&#39;re in this same place wonder if we should do the same, or be content with routine and make sure we&#39;re doing what&#39;s best for our children.  Perhaps embracing experience is -in fact - the best example we can set."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-04-29,"Really starting to discover Bill Nighy, I loved his performance in &#39;About Time&#39;, this movie hits the spot too!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-13,I have no words to express how much I admire this person. He is just brilliant
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-05-28,"Have not seen the movie yet, but I have never been disappointed by Bill Nighy!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-12-17,"Just watched this today; what a beautiful, emotional movie, with life lessons for all. Anything with Mr Nighy touches me deeply and this does exactly that."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-02,"Just saw this last night and really liked it. Some will think it‚Äôs boring, but it‚Äôs not a movie for those people."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-14,"His work/performance in The Man Who Fell To Earth was his best ever IMO. If he is as good in this new movie by a fraction, than he is assured an Oscar."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-18,Fantastic movie that could be set in absolutely any time and place that humans have existed with not exactly the same story but same lesson to learn so much from. ‚ù§
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-30,this film is worth watching for Aimee Lou Wood&#39;&#39;s beautiful voice.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-30,One of the greatest films I have ever watched
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-24,I was betting on Brendan for the Oscar win but after watching this. Bill should get the oscar.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-24,"Bill Nighy is always riveting. This is loosely derived from a film of Kurosawa&#39;s that was itself a cinematic tribute to Leo Tolstoy&#39;s &quot;Death of Ivan Ilyich.&quot; In that short story, there&#39;s not a whole lot of human connection. This seems, honestly, much better than Tolstoy."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-13,Saw it today and cried my eyes out. SO GOOD!
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-06,"&quot;Living&quot; is but a remake of a 1952 B&amp;W Kurosawa film IKIRU (Living in Japanese), one of the best films ever made... I recommend that version"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-07-27,"Excellent setting: GLC had not changed very much up until Ken Livingstone times! Name change to GLA was more of the same!! :) Beautifully acted and a real chemistry between the protagonists.  Very clever editing and cinematography. Brilliant casting. No I am not a bot, its just the way I walk and talk! :) And I simply love the cinema and we do not get very much of it these days! But above all I adored the pace... Must have been a real treat the day when they all read the first script... BRAVO/ BRAVA!!!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-19,Bill Nighy being his amazing self yet again.<br>Thank you for letting us know about this one.  <br>A tale for the soul.‚ù§
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-01,"This looks wonderful, but I so wish to see Bill in another comedic character like like he was in Love actually--he was one of a kind funny!!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-06,"Bill Nighy knows how to captivate the audience. Always. <br><br>&quot;Entwined thou art wi&#39; many ties,<br>O&#39;hame and infancy.&quot;"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-06,I always look for more of Bill Nighy&#39;s work! Thanks.

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-06-13,Bill Nighy is a great talent and lively voice that will never be forgotten! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üé∂üé∂
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-10,Nighy&#39;s performance was definitely Oscar worthy!
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-01-28,Excellent movie. I love B Fraser but gosh I love Bill Nighy too and he did an excellent job(as always).
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-03,He is such a wonderful actor.  I cannot wait to see this movie!!

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-25,"Bill Nighy finally got his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. As much as I wanted Brendan Fraser to win even though Colin Farrell is the frontrunner to prevail, I think BILL NIGHY DESERVES TO WIN THIS! What are your thoughts?"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-14,Saw an advance screening. Touching beautiful film
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-07-10,My only regret was not being able to watch this in cinema. The film is a visual feast.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-11,"The Rowan Tree<br>Can you please release it, earliest!  <br><br>I heard the song for the first time... Searched you tube for a full version as sung by Bill Nighy... But couldn&#39;t find it.<br>üôè"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-06,Watched it last night. Everyone should see this film.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-06-23,even original &quot;Ikiru&quot; is deserved to win Oscar now.

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-22,Thank God for such movies!
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-05-21,Enduring and beautifully sentimental.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-30,Best film playing in theaters right now.  I think it&#39;s even better than &quot;Banshees.&quot;
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-10-19,This film is so brilliant! Watch it.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-21,"Tall, thin, well mannered British..... Not many around here, are they?? Forever a fan since Underworld franchise."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-08-24,"Haven&#39;t seen the film yet, but based off the trailer it seems to be &#39;inspired&#39; from Ikiru(To live). A japanese classic directed by Akira Kurusawa."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-01,"Bill Night, is a great actor"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-03,"It&#39;s not fair to say Nighy will be remembered &quot;for this film&quot; as if we didn&#39;t know and love him already. <br>It does look amazing, though."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-19,Bill Nighy üëè‚ù§Ô∏è
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-05-28,"This is somewhat a remake of &quot;Ikiru&quot;, a 1950s classic for anyone who wants to watch. A must watch for sure too."
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-06-14,Just finished watching it. What a wonderful movie.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-02,Looking forward to seeing this. I love Bill Nighy in everything he is in.

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-02-23,Regardless of his screening time Bill Nighy shines. Always
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-08,Bill Nighy should win the Oscar
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-22,What a gift he is !
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-05,Bill Nighy was amazing a must watch.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-03-23,The original Japanese version is as heartwarming.  I highly recommend it.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-05-19,This movie was absolutely outstanding.

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-25,Film of a bygone era in which Nighy fits perfectly.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-27,i just dont get why this needed to be made. Ikiru is a film that still holds up.
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-05,"This is a good one üçøIt is not sad at all, but a heartwarming lesson of life and the effect we have on those around us. Cheers and enjoy!"
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-12-26,please do not screw this up. it&#39;s one of my favorite Kurosawa movies
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2022-11-20,Bill Nighy knocks it out of the park? What park and what was he knocking out of it? Is this American-speak and am I missing something?
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-27,I love Bill Nighy!  Where can I watch this movie at?
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-12-31,Very beautiful and emotional film

Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-03-02,Why is this film not available to be watched outside the UK?
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2024-04-12,Fabulous work
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-26,Wow..this looks good
Living,OVo5kLt_-BU,2023-01-30,He deserve to win Oscar for best actor. I miss real movies like this. I don&#39;t like CG shit we are forced to watch in the Cinema.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,This might be the most intense season of Hell&#39;s Kitchen yet.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,Everything becomes a thriller when Anya-Taylor Joy in it
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-11-23,The film is literally AMAZING. Not even a single minute of boredom. So unique and difficult to describe clearly it&#39;s genre. But for sure what&#39;s going on in this story will captivate you! Highly recommended.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-09-23,"This is exactly the kind of film I love. It‚Äôs darkly hilarious, focused and immaculately executed. Nicholas Hoult delivers a masterclass performance. One of my favourite actors. Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor Joy are also electrifying. A true gem"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-08,"Visually the film is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.<br>Anya was perfection in it. I loved how her character developed and how she managed to manipulate her way through the film.<br>It is very difficult to pull off a movie that is consistently thrilling all while being a brilliant dark comedy and The Menu is just that."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-12-05,"Absolutely amazing! I am a 30 year chef and to be perfectly honest...  not gonna say many kitchen &amp; industry people wouldn&#39;t smile and nod at many points through this film. As well, everything was so well done. Fresh new story, great social commentary, wildly accurate portrayal of how our craft has been compromised by social media, critics, and people just calling themselves &#39;foodies&#39; without any actually knowledge of what we put in to and sacrifice for our craft. This is by far one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen this year. Perfect blend of comedy, thriller, dialogue, and stellar acting. Really cannot say enough. I&#39;ll leave it with... the trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice and you think you know what this movie will be.... until you don&#39;t."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,Anya Taylor-Joy has great taste in choosing her projects. So this one should be good as well.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,"I used to work in restaurants and this movie gets so much right about them, down to the <b>taptaptap</b> of the foodie telling someone they need to take a photo first."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2025-02-08,"Something the chef said that was so true‚Ä¶they really didn‚Äôt put up much of a fight to survive, which was baffling"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2024-01-27,"As a 43 year old chef I must say this movie is just amazing and Ralph Fines deserves an Oscar nod for his brilliant  performance, love this film, best horror film in years only next to Smile 2022."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,&quot;A round of applause for our Sous Chef - Hannibal Lecter.&quot;
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-12-02,"In case you are interested here are the restaurants that are &quot;mocked&quot; in The Menu:<br><b>Noma</b> in Copenhagen (The mention of the ‚Äúperfectly unripe‚Äù strawberry is from the chef of <b>Noma),</b> <b>Blue Hill</b> at Stone Barns, <b>Mugaritz</b> in the Basque Country, <b>The Willows</b> in the Pacific Northwest, chef Francis Mallmann‚Äôs private island <b>La Isla</b> off the coast of Patagonia.<br>The spice racks are replicated from the kitchen at the now closed restaurant <b>El Bulli,</b> house made granola in gift bags are from <b>Eleven Madison Park.</b> <br>The single raw scallop perched on a craggy rock surrounded by carefully tweezed seaweed and algae is a replicate of a dish at <b>Atelier Crenn.</b> Crenn developed the menu for the movie. Finally, the amuse-bouche served on the boat is a reference to a signature dish from chef Thomas Keller at <b>Per Se.</b>"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-10,"For some reason, this reminds me of &#39;Ready or Not&#39;, and &#39;Fresh&#39;.<br><br>Funny enough, both of them are from Seachlight Pictures, and &#39;Fresh&#39; was also produced by Adam McKay."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2024-02-18,"There are very few movies in life, when after watching you‚Äôll be staring onto your ceiling for a good, good while. This was it :)"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-08,"The movie is phenomenal. So much tension, mystery and also extremely funny. Acting is on point. Could not keep my eyes away. and I don&#39;t like and can&#39;t watch horror movies. It&#39;s like a little horror psych comedy drama. Just amazing"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-10-05,I need to see this movie just to know what happens to the guy who ran with no hesitation on the 45 second head start.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-04,so glad i watched this trailer after i saw the actual film. a lot really adds up to the experience if you go into films BLIND.
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-11,This looks so good
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-03-19,I saw this last night and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. By god it was amazing! So many shocking twists and turns. Love it!
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-08,Having seen the movie without any trailer beforehand I gotta say I was blown away by the twists and this just gives a few away should‚Äôve been a ‚Äòteaser‚Äô
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-20,"&quot;It&#39;s okay - &quot;<br>&quot;No, we&#39;re gonna die tonight.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, we are.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br><br>This sent me. Can&#39;t wait to see this."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-11-20,"Just saw this - I know this trailer is ridiculous, but it&#39;s an amazing movie. So entertaining, original, unique, hilarious, frightening, and thought-provoking all at the same time. The performances are excellent, the writing is terrific, and there truly is no other movie that is quite like it. It&#39;s probably my favorite movie of 2022 (up there with &quot;X&quot;) and I think virtually anyone would get at least some fun out of it."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-11-18,Just saw it today. Outstanding performances from all. Satire at a new level.

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-11-29,"Just watched this movie, its incredible! I mean, they have chosen one location which is usually not ideal for feature films, but it was perfect and the pace is beautiful .. you will be entertained the whole 2 hours. Its very experimental, so not a typical story type that you would usually expect, but def worth watching. The cinematography, editing, the details and characters were just stunningly amazing."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-26,"I loved this movie. I still feel melancholic, some kind of pain, the pain of disapproval from people that never knew what you been through to get there, all the effort. Well made movie, from story to cinematography, actors and the balance of different emotions. It gets into you, we have to appreciate, respect and enjoy."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2024-04-13,Nicholas hoult is so good at acting specifically in scenes where food is involved and when he shows how much he enjoys food...he did it in this movie and also in The Great...I love watching him act like he truly enjoys his food!!!
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-09-14,"I&#39;m glad they brought John Leguizamo for this movie, like a nod to &quot;The Pest&quot; back in the 90s."

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-11-21,"The script, acting, direction, &amp; subject matter make a HUGE, HUGE metaphor of food, eating &amp; preparing...it touches upon history &amp; troubled lives &amp; food it what binds them altogether &amp; yet tears them apart.  Life, &quot;it&#39;s part of The Menu.&quot;"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-31,Never ever trust Lord Voldemort to prepare your food. What did they expect?

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-22,"Saw the movie without watching the trailer first, best decision ever. If you go blind things get intense gradually and gracefully."

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-09,"My friends mentioned this movie tonight at dinner mockingly. I hadn‚Äôt heard of it and thought it sounded ridiculous. They described it as ‚ÄúA bunch of food critiques go to a restaurant and get murdered.‚Äù I compared it to the similarly ridiculous premise of 12 Feet Deep or whatever that movie was about the women being trapped in a pool for a weekend. Then I saw online that it was a satirical comedy thriller, which sounded right up my alley. I watched it without watching the trailer. That was a great move! I really enjoyed it. Obviously it‚Äôs too late for this one, but I recommend watching more movies without watching the trailer first. It was quite thrilling."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-08-21,"Excellent film, one of the best thrillers in years!"

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-07,"Even with everything that happens in this movie, I would still try some of these dishes."
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2024-08-18,Impeccable acting all around. Never knew Hong Chau before but she is excellent in this and brings the character to a higher level. <br>Cooking the cheeseburger is such a great scene. The light returned for a moment
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-09-23,I&#39;ll watch anything and everything with Anya in it!

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-08,"Just saw this movie and it was absolutely amazing!! I was in the edge of my seat the whole time and I love it! The story was incredible and I love how they executed it in a way it would make us all uncomfortable. After all, the truth of the story SHOULD make us uncomfortable. This movie definitely made it to my top list of the best movies I have seen. Anna Taylor-Joy never disappoints as well. She&#39;s phenomenal here!"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2025-03-23,"The Menu was an excellent mix of satire and horror. It showed how art loses its meaning when used for status rather than enjoyment. Margot stood out as the only real customer, and her simple order reminded the chef of true passion. Tyler‚Äôs blind admiration was also striking. The film made me rethink the connection between food and art. Great acting, especially from Margot and the main servant!"
The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2022-08-13,Seeing Nicholas hoult again after sometime since Beast!! Anya-Taylor Joy sounds amusing now with American accent again and great to not only see Ralph Fines but John Lugiuzmo too!!

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-24,"I&#39;m convinced that the pitch for this movie was literally &quot;What if Saw, but food?&quot;"

The Menu,C_uTkUGcHv4,2023-01-11,"as weird as it sounds i actually felt for the chef, i felt bad when he explained he didn‚Äôt find joy in making food for others any more and when erin asked him to make her a cheeseburger it made him feel that joy again and i was happy for him. my mom said something to me the other day that reminded me of this movie she said that i use to love cooking, trying new recipes and discovering my own and now not so much.. i really hope i do find that love again. i love seeing the different ways people react to my cooking üòä"

Good movie but not s original as some commenters say. 20min in I couldn‚Äôt get ‚ÄúMidsommar‚Äù out of my mind.

They said we could remain in theater for about 30 minutes. We used that time to sing praises to Jesus. We had a Christian rapper in the audience who performed an amazing song, then prayer groups broke out. We prayed for each other. I was delivered from cigarettes last night! It was powerful! However, we really want to see this!!!!"

Come Out in Jesus Name,9wNiqbyOUFM,2023-08-22,"I was delivered by watching this documentary on Amazon last night from a spirit of heaviness and depression that wouldn‚Äôt leave through medication. I had an extreme aversion to being at my home even though it was safe. I couldn‚Äôt stand doing anything in my home, including cleaning or just decorating. I wanted to do everything to get away from it. Now I realize it was because we had dedicated this place to God and wrote scripture all over the house as it was being built. A strong spirit of addiction and depression had overtaken me. I denounced it in Jesus name and now I am free. My home was given to me by the Lord as a place to bless others and the devil cannot have place here."

Come Out in Jesus Name,9wNiqbyOUFM,2024-04-16,"Personally Ive seen and been a part of a wide range of services after following Jesus 25 years.  The devil gets way too much credit for the things people choose to do.  Taking up your cross daily becomes a love exchange between you and Jesus.  Galatians 5 says self control is one of the fruits of the Spirit.  Abiding in Jesus is true deliverance, not music, special services, screaming prayers, tongues, or repeating phrases for hours.  Obedience to Jesus according to His word by faith is the way."

Come Out in Jesus Name,9wNiqbyOUFM,2023-02-12,"This is awesome! So many great moments in this trailer! I grew up in the church and I didn&#39;t have a clue. I was always told it was the flesh and never knew I had evil spirits in me, my wife, and my children. God was so merciful and showed us. Now 4 years later we are leading a deliverance ministry in Orange County California and seeing God do amazing things! I&#39;m so excited to see God help my family and I through deliverance and now others in our church and everywhere I go to minister to get freedom in Jesus from evil spirits. I can&#39;t wait to go to this movie. I&#39;m praying and fasting that God will use this video for people to understand and want to be free. For people that don&#39;t have salvation to see that the real power is in Jesus as we surrender to him and have Him change us. I&#39;m bringing a group to this showing near us.

Come Out in Jesus Name,9wNiqbyOUFM,2023-02-28,"Be careful, I believed God delivers people from demons from Christians. But please don‚Äôt just follow sign and wonders. Please follow Jesus by reading and following his Word because He is truth and all you need is Jesus. I do believe that we need spiritual gifts but be careful to not desire that more than being right with God. It‚Äôs easy to seek signs and wonders more than seeking repentance and seeking His will. Please just be careful, and watch this through the Word of God. His baptized me with the Holy Spirit and told me that He will wants to give me more gifts. But I focused so much on the gifts rather than repentance and I made a fool of myself by praying super loud in tongues thinking that it will make me have more gifts. But all God wants if for you to surrender by repentance and doing His will. God will make you into a holy vessel by His holy blood and through following His word through faith. Love you guys, follow Jesus and He will use you."
Come Out in Jesus Name,9wNiqbyOUFM,2024-02-10,"I&#39;ve watched this trailer a billion times over and still get taught something. I felt the Lord speak and say, &quot;without God using Pastor Greg Locke, there would&#39;ve been no stage set for this generation of deliverance&quot;. You can call me a liar all you want I heard it. He set the platform for this generation and was used by God to gain the attention to spark forth this revival.

Many became free and returned to their right mind and peace. I was on the fence before this experience but obviously not now. The police ended up being called so I would doubt they will make another showing so let&#39;s pray theatres keep hosting this movie.<br><br>May the Lord wake up the church to this need."

The Miracle Club,Gp3ZFdklPCk,2023-06-11,"Why do I have a feeling that, without seeing the film........<br><br>(SPOILER ALERT)<br><br>That Maggie Smith&#39;s character is dying (notice how she is in a wheelchair in aome scenes) and that one of the miracles they are seeking is her to get better, but she will still die, and hence the meaning of that pastor&#39;s message of finding hope when there is no miracle."
The Miracle Club,Gp3ZFdklPCk,2023-05-29,"Oh Dear!

The Miracle Club,Gp3ZFdklPCk,2023-10-17,This is wonderful  how can l get ful film
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,There‚Äôs something about Florence Pugh‚Äôs acting that seems so natural and sincere. This looks really heart felt.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-16,"Parts of A Good Person were shot inside my house (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, study, living room and exteriors) and in my town of Rutherford. The production company, crafts, departments and cast were all outstanding. I know because I do Location Management. This came to me out of nowhere and I was just the &quot;homeowner&quot;. Director Zach Braff just has a wonderful deft feel for all aspects of his films. He is a total Jersey guy and the cinematic and sound textures he uses really are sweet signatures on his projects. He put together an outstanding  group of union professionals and the care shows!"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-13,I just saw this. Literally cried the whole way through.  As a recovering addict myself this was beyond moving. Florence&#39;s performance was flawless. Beautifully made. A must see.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-20,"When I was 12 my dad died in a car accident that I was in with him. When I was 23 I got sober from alcohol and drug addiction. This movie is probably going to make me bawl my eyes out the entire time, but I&#39;m also grateful that it was made. I feel like I&#39;m seeing parts of myself on screen. It&#39;s hard to find people out there that I feel like could understand that particular type of trauma. I&#39;m looking forward to watching this."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Florence deserves to be in every movie!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,"Just by the trailer I can already see that Florence is once again not gonna disappoint, I already bawled my eyes out just watching this, I can&#39;t wait to watch the rest and cry even more lol"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-08,"I saw this film last night and was in tears pretty much the whole way through, as was half the audience. It is INCREDIBLE"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,The trailer already has me emotional. So excited to see Florence Pugh starring with Morgan Freeman. Great pairing. And Zach Braff knows how to tug on those heartstrings!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-18,"I really liked everything about this film. Florence Pugh is amazing. I love the rawness of emotion. The desire to forgive, yet anger is always simmering. Guilt is a dangerous emotion. The model trains were a wonderfully delicate &amp; subtle symbol that represents the life they wanted, &amp; the lives they ended up with. A truly beautiful film."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-11,"As someone who struggles with Trauma and alcohol addiction from said Trauma, I think I&#39;m going to really connect with this film. I LOVE Florence more than life itself, and Garden state has always been one of my favorite movies, I&#39;m so excited!"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,"I was offered a very small role in this film during a bar scene &amp; had to turn down the offer due to it being shot in NJ/NY during Thanksgiving, I would&#39;ve needed to be gone for five days &amp; just couldn&#39;t make it work.... but ever since then, I&#39;ve had so many amazing opportunities in the film industry come my way. This was my first offer in a major film &amp; I will always look at this as my good luck charm bc ever since then- I&#39;ve been steadily being pushed into the film industry one opportunity at a time. Zach Braff has been my favorite writer &amp; director since Garden State... the caliber in which this man writes &amp; films is beyond great &amp; I just know this will be a hit. Can&#39;t wait to see this in theaters"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-16,"Amazing!  Zach has done it again, and Florence is just phenomenal. For those who were asking about songs in the trailer: #1 Odessa &quot;Wake Up With The Sun&quot;, #2 Angelo De Augustine &quot;Time&quot;, #3 Cary Brothers &quot;Stardust.&quot;"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-29,"I loved this film. Couldn‚Äôt stop the tears from flowing and enjoyed the cast performances, especially Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh. I‚Äôm glad I saw A Good Person."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-29,"Just watched it. <br>It was emotionally touching, uplifting, comedic, and heavily fueled by Florence Pugh&#39;s performance and chemistry with Morgan Freeman."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-02,Just saw this last night. I don&#39;t wanna spoil anything... but this movie broke me down. I recommend this to anyone dealing with grief. The trailer hardly does this film justice. So emotionally layered.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-16,something tells me a good person is going to be a good film. it definitely got those feel good vibes of 00&#39;s / early 2010&#39;s movies. also florence pugh and the morgan freeman starring in this - that&#39;s peak cinema.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Only one glimpse of Florence&#39;s face can illuminate a whole town. She&#39;s mesmerizing as an actress ü•∫
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-11-22,"I just celebrated 5 years of being sober from alcohol, back in September.  I bawled my eyes out watching this trailer. Addiction makes me fearful,scared and you lack any self-esteem.  I will be watching this."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Florence and Freeman!! Looks like a good heartfelt drama!!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Florence Pugh truly doesn&#39;t miss!! This is going to leave me in a puddle of my own tears
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-21,"Came here from the &quot;Fake Doctors, Real Friends&quot; podcast. Today&#39;s episode was Zach and Florence talking about making the film while living together during Covid. It&#39;s a great listen to give some background"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,every project Florence Pugh is in is phenomenal
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-20,Florence Pugh &amp; Morgan Freeman will be amazing with their great performances in A Good Person!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Zach Braff really showing the world he has great directing chops.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-19,"So glad to see Zach Braff behind the directors chair on a story he crafted, again. I love Garden State so much and this seems like it is cut from the same cloth. Excited to see this one :-)"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-01-28,"I teared up just watching the trailer, just imagine how much I‚Äôll be crying during the movie. Huge fan of Morgan Freeman."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Looking forward to the soundtrack if the music in the trailer is really in the film. Zach chooses great music that tugs at your heartstrings in ways that enhance every scene.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-01-13,This Angelo Augustine track is perfect for this trailer. Zach Braff is also one of my favorite actors/producers. Can&#39;t wait to see this one
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-19,"This looks amazing and it has three of my faves involved: Morgan, Florence and Zach. I can&#39;t wait to see it."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-16,"As soon as Time by Angelo de Augustine played, tears started welling up my eyes. Can&#39;t wait to see this movie! Florence and Freeman are gonna make me cry."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-05-10,"Once you finish watching this movie you&#39;ll realize that the title applies on every character. They&#39;re all &#39;a good person &#39; with good intentions who&#39;s trying to do the best they can. They&#39;re all did things they regret and they&#39;re trying their best to do better. I walked in didn&#39;t expected it would be this deep and beautiful. If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, you definitely should üî•"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-25,"an emotional rollercoaster that exposes the raw life of those addicted to pain killers and alchol! Amazing acting, but then with this cast, how could they have gone wrong! Florence gives an Oscar winning performance!"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-26,Saw this today. I really liked it! Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman are amazing!

THANK YOU ZACH FOR BRINGING THE REAL DEAL IN LIFE TO THE SCREENS‚Ä¶TV &amp; MOVIES‚Ä¶FOREVER GRATEFULüôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-01-08,Zach braff really is one of my favourite directors !!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-12-14,"Finally, a good movie! I&#39;ve been watching a lot of duds. This one was really well-done."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-14,"This movie is really good for an indie film. I am glad Morgan Freeman accepted to be in it. The story and the acting are great on all sides, but you can tell it&#39;s low budget. Regardless, it is great! And this guy&#39;s acting at 82-83 is simply baffling. He&#39;s literally a work of art!<br>P. S. The music is also very well picked. The ideas are brilliant. I wish their budget was bigger. And you can hear Zach Braff in it. I am a massive Scrubs fan too."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-18,Mr Freeman is a legend.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2024-08-11,I just watched this movie and I was in tears. Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman are very good actors. <br>The movie was so realistic because people go through addiction and loss and trauma and the actors captured those emotions and pain. <br>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a movie that touched me on a personal level as much as this one.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-17,I love Florence Pugh and I LOVE Zach Braff as a director! Garden state is one of my favourite films. I can‚Äôt wait to watch this!!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-09-15,"Saw the movie today, It&#39;s great! A tender and profund story about forgiveness, which is the single most beautiful and revolutionary thing."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,There&#39;s nothing better than listening Morgan Freeman&#39;s voiceover.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Zack Braff has the best soundtracks.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-05-04,"I watched the film right now, finished around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phRXBLwcy5I&amp;t=240"">4:00</a> o‚Äôclock in the night/morning and with a little tear in my eye, I can only say:<br>So good Zack Braff ‚ûï cast!.<br>This is definitely the best film üéû you made since üé• Garden State!.<br>With kindest regards &amp; thank you very much for this piece of artüôè‚ÄºÔ∏è."

A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-16,I shouldn‚Äôt be crying through a trailer! This looks amazing!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-07,"I have ALWAYS enjoyed watching the types of movies that pull at your heartstrings &amp; I know a lot of that has to do with the fact that I was a psychology major in college so with that being said, I know I&#39;m definitely going to enjoy watching this movie."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-08-28,Anything with Morgan has got to be great!!!
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,Florence&#39;s name is enough to make me wanna watch it.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-29,"All the sadness I bottled up came out during this movie. Loved the movie, haven&#39;t seen such a gem in a long time."
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-02-28,Very good actress I would not be surprise if she gets a  award  down the road!!

A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-04-10,"Really enjoyed this film. I understood why some critics didn&#39;t enjoy it but I ultimately didn&#39;t care because the performances were great. It was just a movie that no matter how sad it was, left me feeling a happy."

A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2022-12-15,"Florence is a serious talent, I can&#39;t wait to see her in Chris Nolans next movie.üòØ"
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-03-31,It looks like a good one.  I ve been through it and i dont think I want to go for that ride again.  But maybe streaming.  People that have no idea will still have no idea..... Nothing prepares you for when there is nothing and breath is painful and repulsive.

A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2023-08-11,Accidentally taking the life of a loved one leaves you with a ton of guilt and self-forgiveness becomes nearly impossible. The law and public opinion can tear everything apart. It&#39;s having companionship and reflecting on life that become the most essential psychological pillars for overcoming addiction and rising from rock bottom.
A Good Person,phRXBLwcy5I,2024-03-29,"Loved this movie!!! My favorite type of movie, so enjoyable the whole way through!"

Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-25,I just LOVED this movie. I could see it again.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-02-12,Just beautiful üíû Well done!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-09-10,On HULU Now!!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-28,"Just went and seen this with my mother in law and this trailer doesn&#39;t do it justice, this movie was awesome. It was funny and I can&#39;t get better then Jane and Lily!! Have to say one of my new favorites!!"
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-01,Seems to be really good üëç üòä
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-20,I love this duo
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-09-24,Luv both  ladies crazy and  want more.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-12-09,"this was such a good movie. came here to watch the trailer, watched the film, came back. anyone wondering, its amazing. very funny. Thelma and Louise vibes but a a little easier to stomach."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-05-29,Oh lawd cant imagine watching this...but I will
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-09-08,Watching this on Prime and it&#39;s excellent!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-06,"I&#39;m not a big fan of all the plastic surgery they had that immobilizes their faces, and I&#39;m not a big fan of Fonda, but damn, I want to see a comedy  with older people in it that&#39;s not a superhero movie.  I will go see this"
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-04-30,I love them together so much! ‚ù§
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-04,OMG I need to see this movie quickly! I want see the couple togheter now !!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-20,Their faces are as expressive as their acting‚Ä¶
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-06-01,Grace and Frankie ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-28,And they just did 80 for Brady together
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-20,"I may have missed the previews before <i>80 for Brady</i> but this should have been one of them. They&#39;re advertising Jane Fonda&#39;s other film, <i>Book Club, The Next Chapter</i> for May 12, but why haven&#39;t I seen this advertised?"
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-10-15,"A condom, that&#39;s funny!<br>A tube of KY is more likely, it&#39;s like the sahara in there."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-10,Love this! Can‚Äôt wait!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-10-09,How do I find the music that was played during the movie?
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-09-06,Looks great!! They should do a remake to a more mature thelma and louise
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-19,Really enjoyed this today. The part for Richard Roundtree reminds me of Sam Elliott&#39;s part in Grandma...a real &quot;he should get more parts&quot; part. Saddened to see the In Memory Of at the end. I loved that guy as Walt. But why isn&#39;t he listed in the IMDB credits?
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-12-10,"Wow, I know Hollywood can do a lot for a face, but we should all hope to look as healthy as Jane Fonda at 85."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-26,I am looking forward to seeing this but I wish it would be more realistic as most of us nearing our 80‚Äôs cannot afford to look like 40 year olds.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-16,"This has Oscar written all over it. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-08,Morning mess brought me here
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-18,Good to know she&#39;s not going to forget her pills.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-24,That&#39;s jane fonda!!?
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-10-14,The gun shop scene was accurate!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-04-11,oh Malcolm üòÜ
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-16,Is sad movie with strong elements not a comedy...
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-03-29,"Great movie, I&#39;ll watch anything with these two. (Spoiler alert !) but I think the message of this movie is not so great, rape should be reported and not be treated as something shameful to the victim."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-10,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23janefondaterrorist"">#janefondaterrorist</a>"
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-01-13,"I watched forty minutes of this film, no, not more, it is dull, ugh."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-02,Fucking Shaft is in this? The fuck?
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2024-11-20,This is an evil premise and VERY offensive movie trailer!  Why is our society normalizing psychopathic behavior?!  It&#39;s not funny!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-11,And now you&#39;ve guatanteed your movie will flop
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-06-17,Watched it. Boring!
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-09,I didn‚Äôt know anyone still considered Comrade Fonda still worth watching.    You enjoy‚Ä¶..I will pass.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-29,Please dear god no more from these two.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-13,Boycott Jane Fonda. Howard must be Pro-life.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-01,"i&#39;m in for roundtree, tomlin, and mcdowell............jane fonda is just an unpleasant occurance."
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-02-07,this looks awful
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-19,What in the actual f? <br>And having unbridled sex at their age? Knit a blanket for a grandkid or something. Jeez.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-22,Terrible movie.
Moving On,RCSKI5nO9V0,2023-03-12,So tired of these two.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-08,So it takes place in this house?
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-18,"I saw a spooky face in the trailer and got a fright, I immediately realised it was my reflection on the screen of my phone<br>10/10"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-22,This is surprisingly accurate to what it&#39;s like being a kid in a creepy dark house. There&#39;s an atmosphere unlike any other
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-11-10,"FYI- the voice that says ‚ÄúIn This House‚Äù is the voice of William Peter Blatty, the author and screenwriter of the Exorcist and Legion. Also, that track is taken from the original (banned) exorcist trailer‚Ä¶ love that detail"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-01,One of my favorite parts of this trailer is how it subverts your expectations (whether or not that was intentional) it recreates most horror movie trailers with  a deep voice reading off lines <br>Like ‚ÄúIn this house‚Ä¶‚Äù after that you‚Äôd expect him to say ‚ÄúFear takes hold‚Ä¶‚Äù or some cheesy line but instead he just repeats ‚ÄúIn this house‚Äù as if the trailer itself has been corrupted as the voice is distorted repeatedly
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-15,"Just saw this film. <br><br>My suggestions to anyone wanting to watch it; if you‚Äôre looking to have the best experience with the film, watch it alone or with people that don‚Äôt talk during movies. If you don‚Äôt it may spoil it‚Äôs highly unique atmosphere designed to draw you in through vivid imagery and sound design. <br><br>Be patient with this film. It is not your typical formulaic setup. It is much like how the trailer presents it, but a much longer and more suspenseful and tense version. <br><br>I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd recommend this to many people, it‚Äôs kind of a thing where you just have to try it for yourself and see how it makes you feel."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-07-12,"This film perfectly captures that feeling that you get when you‚Äôre home alone, especially as a child. That, even if it seems it‚Äôs only you in the dark, you always have that feeling that you are not alone when you look in the pitch black."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-18,"I never get scared by horror films but this one DEFINITELY got me. Silence, scary noises and darkness. I really like that they use darkness to mess with you. Since the mind can play tricks when in the dark"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-20,"This is EXACTLY what a horror film trailer should be. No explicit explanation of the plot, story, characters, twist, etc. Just some eerie imagery with the dark voice over saying &quot;in this house&quot;. Love it.<br><br>EDIT: Just saw the film, and <b>phew</b><br><br>EDIT #2: I have come to the conclusion that this film is not for everyone, from what I can see in the comments."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-30,This trailer really nails the feeling of &quot;fucked up disjointed nightmare that makes you wake up in a cold sweat.&quot; <br>I&#39;ve had nightmares like this before and they have always genuinely terrified me. It&#39;s like that instinctual fear in the pit of your stomach that&#39;s really hard to describe
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-15,"As someone who has dealt with weekly nightmares and sleep paralysis this film absolutely got me. Trying to sleep that night was incredibly difficult. Probably not a film for everyone, but definitely well made and spooky as hell if this is a semi common thing you deal with."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-04-02,"That line ‚ÄúIn this house‚Äù is from Exorcist theater trailer. It was banned because it was too scary for the people, they even ran out"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-08,I definitely appreciate Shudder adding more experimental films to its catalogue. The countless variety is what I want and happy to pay for. This film is a hell of a journey. Kyle Edward Ball truly filmed the type of bad dream that lingers with you for the rest of the day.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-04-10,"Best ceiling, doorframe, carpet and lego slideshow ever made."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-14,"This looks like every night I come home from work. My kids not asleep, their toys all over the house and the tv left on wasting electricity. Truly terrifying stuff."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-04-25,I don&#39;t remember the last time I wanted to cover my eyes watching a horror movie. I was practically begging this movie to end because I didn&#39;t want to experience the horror and the tension anymore. The relief I felt when it ended was palpable.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-08,"Horror movies don&#39;t really scare me anymore but I definitely got goosebumps watching this. I hope it&#39;s all shot like this, if feels like a nightmare."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-02-10,"This movie was made for people who experienced intense fear when they were kids. They managed to recreate the absolute horror of empty houses and your child brain using its full creative power to imagine horrible things that may be there. If you found it boring, you were not that kid."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-18,"This might be the most effective trailer for a horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. First time I saw this trailer was in a theater, and it was such a surreal experience. Never seen this sort of take on a trailer before."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-03-30,"&quot;In this House&quot; counter:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=4"">0:04</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=22"">0:22</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=34"">0:34</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=47"">0:47</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=59"">0:59</a>"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-17,i think what makes this the most like a genuine nightmare experience is how it sounds like the child is genuinely unable to raise his voice above a whisper or make coherent words. that&#39;s something no one seems to register in dreams. you can&#39;t break the silence yourself.<br><br>something has to break it for you.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-22,the trailer alone gives you this very uneasy feeling and it&#39;s amazing. It even gives you the feeling of home movie/found footage and  how the audio is edited and it&#39;s very distorted is amazing! I can&#39;t wait to see this film
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-10,I was never afraid of the dark when I was a kid. I was afraid of the sound. The silences between the sounds are the scariest moments I have ever experienced.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-08-06,"Let&#39;s take the worst childhood nightmare and make it into an hour and forty minute art film.<br>This is definitely one of those love it or absolutely hate it movies. I actually was really into it. Every single scene is unsettling and the atmosphere of dread is thick throughout its runtime. And I love atmospheric films that understand that the unknown, if orchestrated correctly, can be much more frightening than monsters with a face, a name and a clear M.O."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-23,"This is genuinely the scariest trailer for a movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It perfectly describes my childhood nightmares and fears. Also the sound design for this trailer (and hopefully the movie) is absolutely incredible and gave me chills.<br>UPDATE: call me a wuss I don&#39;t care but that was horrifying, especially in theaters. Loved the sound design and how surreal it was but it was very stressful and I don&#39;t think I wanna see it again"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-08,It‚Äôs been years since a horror trailer has shaken me with chills. It has such a 70s vibe.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-31,"Looks like it&#39;s the fly from the movie &quot;The Ring&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APQqilSTxz0&amp;t=14"">00:14</a>. Its acting was great in The Ring, I&#39;m glad it managed to get by and find a job in this one too!"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-02-23,"This trailer is so good. No scary music, no jumpscares, just pure tension and horror."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-15,saying ‚Äúin this house‚Äù in the same manner but then suddenly in higher pitch just scares me for some reason. brilliant
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-18,"One of the best trailers I‚Äôve seen in a while. This is what a trailer should be, gives you an idea of what the feel of the movie is going to be without giving away its plot. Never understood those people that feel like a trailer needs to tell you the story of the movie. All I need is the vibe and feel of a movie and the story part can be filled in when I actually watch the movie."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-27,"I like that theres no monsters in this trailer, just creepy sounds, images and atmosphere in general. Really captures the mind of a toddler alone in the middle of the night. Where you dont know if theres a horrific creature or its just the wind. Imo would be better if theres a creepy object/something in the background at some shots it would be really unsettling especially to someone that payed attention to the film"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-11-01,One of the only things to ever legitimately scare me.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-30,"Seems like a metaphor for the foggy memories of a kid who had their parents divorce after lots of fighting, and the disappearing things represented something like the memories of moving from the old family home to something like a small apartment. My parents divorced when I was 3 and each ended up with new partners, then each of the new partners ended up constantly screaming and fighting. I just have scattered fuzzy memories of getting bounced back and forth between houses, and always being surrounded by screaming, fighting and things getting thrown around. <br>This feels like what it would be like to get literally dropped into those memories with the fog of time that comes with a 40 yr old remembering being 6 actually manifesting.<br>Very good stuff."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-26,Been a horror enthusiast for over 10 years and I literally cannot remember the last time a movie made me that scared. Absolute atmospheric horror masterpiece
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-04-03,"I like how it‚Äôs just like an analog horror and instead of building up tension and releasing it with a jump scare like other movies it keeps the tension and never shows any monster, and the unknown is scarier than actually seeing the monster itself"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-25,I need more movies like this please it‚Äôs so immersive and every shot just feels me with an uneasy feeling so much anxiety I freaking love it
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-14,I&#39;m an adult and the scariest thing is still looking down a dark hallway
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-18,"I‚Äôve never seen anything like Skinamarink. Saw it with a friend of mine tonight, and it terrified the bejeezus out of us. Real, primal, childlike terror. Kyle Edward Ball has a very bright future ahead of him in horror and I can‚Äôt wait to see what he does next"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-06-30,My kind of movie thank you.  You have to watch it relaxed and calm at bedtime... no commercials. No interruptions . Its honestly creepy bliss until you dose off and then wake up to creepy sounds.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-13,"This has serious Navidson Record vibes and I love it. Looks perfect, feverish and nostalgic but still very unsettling."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-23,i was out watching Violent Night last night with my boyfriend and this came on during the ads out of no where. it was the loudest scariest thing i‚Äôve ever experienced in the movie theater. the horror buff in me wants to watch it but this i know will genuinely wreck me.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-17,probably the scariest experience I&#39;ve ever had in a movie theater. felt like a feature length panic attack. 10/10
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-02-17,"I watched this almost a year ago, and to this day it sticks with me. It‚Äôs one of the most confusing, yet tense and terrifying films i‚Äôve seen"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-27,"I expected to hear creepy dark narration of what happens, but just repeating ‚Äúin this house‚Äù was creepier and a pleasant surprise"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-24,Pro tip :  if you watch this trailer on repeat for an hour and a half its the same as watching the actual movie
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-15,"Never in my life has a trailer alone made me genuinely afraid. I have chills, can&#39;t wait to see this tonight"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2025-01-05,"I watched this alone in my house with all the lights off.  Little did I know how bad of an idea that was. I damn near had a heart attack. Watching this, it really dug into me and freaked me out. I have not been scared by a movie in a long time. This one is different but really requires a lot of focus and patience. It is such a relief when it is over, but I must say in that sense it is a great film that it can create such an atmosphere like that. One I won‚Äôt forget"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-23,"One of the things that that makes this eerie is the voiceover repeatedly saying ‚ÄúIn this house‚Äù and nothing is said further. We‚Äôre left to our imagination as to what is wrong with the home. What is also unsettling is that the ones in danger are young children, horror movies rarely ever have them be terrorized, usually it‚Äôs teenagers and people who are older."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-10,this looks so terrifying in such a genuine and organic way. Very rare for a horror film these days. It looks like a very experimental horror film which creates an atmosphere of dread and fear. <br><br>Very few trailers have given me such a chill as this one I can&#39;t wait to watch it in its complete form.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-24,"Watching this trailer with headphones on, in my fully lit home during total daylight, still had me looking over my shoulder. Can&#39;t wait to watch this. Been a long time since a movie genuinely scared me."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-11-26,this might be the perfect trailer. I keep coming back to it
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-28,This trailer is a great example of what a horror movie trailer should be <br>-Its vague<br>-It doesn&#39;t reveal the whole movie<br>- It gives a scary atmosphere<br>-In an original way too
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-02,"This is the best trailer I have seen in the last decade...and I&#39;m not joking. The perfect trailer, showing less and then, give you a real reason to discover the rest."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-12,"Early critical reviews are all good ..<br>The way they describe, it‚Äôs supposed to bring the kind of fears u experienced as a child.. word is it‚Äôs a chilling film. And full of suspense‚Ä¶<br>Can‚Äôt wait!  Love Shudder.."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-07-02,"Excellent .. I would like to thank the filmmakers for creating dread, with cinematography that doesn&#39;t look like a Verizon commercial"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-20,"I read a book one time that made me feel the way this movie made me feel.  It was tense, scary, and made me absolutely certain that I wasn&#39;t alone, even though I was.  It was difficult to get through, because I had a constant feeling of dread.<br>Most people would find it boring.  But to those who thrive on suspense, this may be a good choice.<br>It made me nervous to leave the room."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-27,The &quot;in this house&quot; gives me serious chills
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-16,"Saw it twice opening weekend. It&#39;s important to be silent and immerse yourself. Watch it twice as well. First for the horror, second time to finish putting all of the pieces together. <br>And you&#39;ll still be afraid."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2025-03-03,"THIS is how you do a trailer. Creeping, intriguing, doesn&#39;t give the whole plot away. GOD I love SHUDDER"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-08,Thank you SHUDDER and IFC MIDNIGHT! Looking forward to the theatrical release of SKINMARINK! (Can&#39;t wait for it to hit streaming too!)
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-08,the final shot of this movie is among the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen in my life
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-26,the phone call part‚Ä¶ and then the closing part of this movie‚Ä¶ made me cry.. and for two totally different reasons <br>The first was out of concern and relatability <br>The second was out of pure fear. <br>I haven‚Äôt felt fear like that from an art piece ever in my life. I‚Äôve only felt true terror like that from things in my real life that caused me trauma. Wow
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-07-14,"Probably one of the best trailers ever made. I‚Äôm not a movie buff, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capping."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-13,"I know there&#39;s currently a dialogue regarding the sketchy ways people have used to view this movie before its official release, so I&#39;m urging everyone who sees this to please either sub to Shudder or see this movie in theaters if possible. We need to support creators who take risks if we want our beloved genre to stay fresh and innovative like it always has.<br><br>I know there are always issues when it comes to regional availability, so I understand that some people have no choice but to resort to piracy. Just simply asking people to make an effort if possible!"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-16,Glad to see films going back to it&#39;s essence. And not rely purely on jump scares and over the top gore. Horror done well
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-13,Just seen it in the cinema. I wish I had done a bit of research before to understand this type of film genre a bit better. Not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea but definitely an interesting and bold way of making a film
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-10-28,"LOVE the heavy film grain and sparse sound.  It is memories of a fever dream from childhood when you were lost and confused in your own home.  It is a childhood sleep over when you are beyond tiered, ready to pass out while the rest of the kids are still playing and the cartoons are blaring from the TV.  It is Paranormal Activity from the perspective of a young child.  It is the constant build up to... something that never comes.<br>There is no narrative to this movie.<br>I respect what they were going for, but after an hour in I was desperately waiting for SOMETHING to happen.  There were a couple of genuinely disturbing sequences but nothing lead to anything.  I love the film grain, the drone of early era cartoons in the distance, the constant audio hiss...  I need to wait for this to grow on me.  <br>If you watch this, do not buy into the hype.  Have all of the lights off.  Turn up the volume. Have an open mind and just go along with the ride."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-16,that ending shot was absolutely chilling in the theater. never seen a movie hold that kind of a vibe the entire way without going too big at the end if i&#39;m being honest.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-02,"I see a lot of people who said they hated it and thought it was boring, and I get it it&#39;s not a movie that appeals to everyone, but my god that was traumatazing to me and I loved it."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-14,"This trailer reminded me of something that happened to me when I was like 4. I usually slept with my two cousins (3 and 4) in one room. The room has large windows but when I woke up at night one day it was pitch black. I could see absolutely nothing and I don&#39;t remember if I wanted to pee but I got out of the bed to look for the door. The door was in front of my bed but I remember I walked in the dark and found nothing. Then I bumped into something like a tunnel so I walked on my hands and knees and got inside that hole (there was no hole in my room btw) the I came out but it was still pitch black. I gave up looking for the door so I started looking for my bed again, I was still walking on my hands and knees until I touched a bed and there was someone on the bed so I touched their feet and I thought it was my cousin but I kept touching since I could see nothing. From her feet I went up to her knees, then the waits and finally the shoulders. Here&#39;s the creepy part: there was no head. I was so confused and I could see nothing so I started again from her feet to her shoulders and I passed my hand from one shoulder to the other. No head. I immediately started crying. Another weird thing, as soon as I started crying I was immediately grabbed by someone from the bed, it wasn&#39;t a child because they hugged me and it felt like the arms of an adult and they started petting my head. I felt a sense of peace and fell asleep in the arms of that person. The next when I woke up I asked my cousins (3 and 4 yrs old) who was it who hugged me at night and they had no idea what I was talking about. They said they never heard me cry, that they didn&#39;t wake up at night. I&#39;m 36 now and I never forgot that night. There was someone in that room that pat my head lovingly, there was a little girl with no head on that bed and I don&#39;t know what hole I went into in a pitch black room looking for a door I never found. It wasn&#39;t a dream."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-12-07,the title &quot;skinamarink&quot; reminds me of that one nursery rhyme that says &quot;skinamarink a dink a dink skinamarink a doo i love you&quot;
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-26,"Love the old feel of this trailer. It adds to the atmosphere of it and really draws the viewer in, especially one that may not realize that this is a modern film. I sadly don&#39;t have access to watching it, but I hope all goes well with its Shudder release."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-10,"I love how divisive this film is! But I do genuinely feel sorry for those who didn&#39;t enjoy it, I&#39;ve been thinking about it for a week now"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-19,"The last shot of this movie, is genuinely one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-04-10,In this house..... 3 things happen in 1 hour and 40 minutes.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-21,This movie really scared me and every time I get ready for bed in this house voice keeps popping up in my head this is what horror really is it‚Äôs the unknown that really scares people I loved this masterpiece I want more films like this it‚Äôs a whole new genre
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-17,"Saw it last night, and after being confused and frustrated by the first half I became enamored (and terrified) by the second half. Now that it‚Äôs been a day I can say I loved it!"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-09,That‚Äôs definitely a vibe that I can‚Äôt wait to catch in the cinema.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-04-20,For fans of the film: Have you seen the 30-Minute &#39;precursor&#39; to this one? Its called HECK. I love the title; right away it tells the viewer a clue: Heck is a child&#39;s word for &#39;hell.&#39;
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-16,That grainy audio really sells this as an 80‚Äôs drive in movie and I‚Äôm into it
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-18,This is actually a pretty good representation of what sleep paralysis is like.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-12,"This is a great trailer.  The look of 16mm made me think of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then the &quot;1973&quot; briefly popped up, and I realized that was an intentional vibe the filmmakers were going for.  My only concern is that this trailer could be creepier than the actual movie, but it definitely has me wanting to see the movie.  The initial &quot;In This House&quot; voice reminds me of me favorite horror movie trailer VO guy from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-09-16,"I‚Äôm a huge horror person and I‚Äôve become really desensitized to most horror movies, but when I watched this, it slowly dug itself under my skin. I was not expecting to be so affected by this film, and I was so paranoid being by myself after it ended üòÖ"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-09,It‚Äôs been a minute since a movie made me feel creeped out walking around my own house. It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. But if you let it sit with you you‚Äôll be rewarded.
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-28,"I really love the atmosphere, it reminds me of a lot of 80s horror. It clearly has a lot of thought put into it. It&#39;s unique"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-13,"Brilliant trailer. That low budget, &#39;70&#39;s vibe really gets under the skin."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-04-25,"I love this trailer. I know it&#39;s just a movie but I feel bad for those kids, man"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-23,"Brilliant, slow burn, low budget, film. If you can get through the entire movie, only then, can you appreciate how amazing it is."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-14,"I just got home after seeing this movie in theaters. Like many of you, I was looking forward to the unsettling, corrupted childhood, and analogue horror elements the trailer promised. I‚Äôm here to tell you that, in my personal opinion, this style doesn‚Äôt really hold up over the course of a feature-length movie. I would‚Äôve enjoyed this movie far more as a 20 min short film. Many web series that exist‚Äîmany of them here on YouTube‚Äîare jam-packed with content, ‚Äúclues‚Äù, or symbolism. So much of this movie is purely atmospheric shots with absolutely no information. And not like ‚Äúoh but the way the lighting frames this object is symbolic of [blank]‚Äù‚Ä¶there are significant periods of time where there is absolutely no information conveyed. I understand that this movie is some people‚Äôs cup of tea, and I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt watch it. It‚Äôs very experimental‚Äîballsy, even‚Äîand does have a place in the world of film. That being said, I would suggest seeing it at home so that you have the option to tap out halfway through without feeling like you wasted $20 at the movies.<br><br>Edit:<br>ALSO!!!!!! If you are triggered by themes of child abuse, abandonment, separation anxiety, things of that nature, you may find this movie especially upsetting."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-03-07,One of the best trailers ever made just off the trailer it‚Äôs scarier and chilling than most full movies today
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-07-12,in this houseüî•üíØüó£
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-08,"The trailer had me on the hook and this film delivered. I have never seen a horror movie that captured more viscerally the feeling of waking up as a helpless child in your own home. It is not for the Paranormal activity crowd, or anyone else who is tethered to conventional horror. This movie is fundamentally scary."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-09,"Genuinely not sure if this movie is for me, or if it wouldn‚Äôt work better as a short film than a feature, but man this trailer hits so hard I GOTTA check it out"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-14,"If I had to hear the kid say &quot;dad&quot; one more time lmao. Fr tho, some parts were actually very effective (that last minute was insanely terrifying), but I kept rolling my eyes whenever the cartoons would replay the same clip or there would be repetitive shots of the legos or stuffed animals. I really wanted to love this, especially since the trailer was so good, but an hour and forty minutes just felt way too much. The bedroom scene was particularly memorable... I actually was kinda panicking when the kid slowly checked under the bed lol. I think this movie would be a much better experience at home, alone in the dark, than it is in a theater with a crowd, which is how I watched it. There was just a weird collective sense of confusion and boredom amongst everyone that only took about 5 minutes to form, and that weird feeling unfortunately never went away. I&#39;m going to give this a rewatch on Shudder when it comes out, as I&#39;m almost certain I&#39;ll actually be very afraid of it then."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2024-12-28,"Loved it. Glad I was able to understand the aura the film was trying to emulate. I felt the same sense of fear I would have when I would wake up in the middle of the night as a child to a dark, quiet house."
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2022-12-11,"It&#39;s been a long time since a horror movie  trailer freaked me out.  I can&#39;t wait to watch this film. Hopefully, it is just as creepy as the trailer"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-09,"I don&#39;t remember how long it&#39;s been since I&#39;ve been genuinely scared by a movie trailer like this. I had to hold my phone farther away from my face, make a conscious effort to control my breathing, brace myself not to jump, and I had to exit full-screen before it ended (granted it&#39;s 1 am and my lights are off). I&#39;m a 20-year-old man and have been watching every horror movie I could find since the age of like 12. I don&#39;t think I have the balls to watch this alone, lol"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-02-22,"This really looks like an arg, which can be a good thing. Looks really unique and feels like one of those dreams you wake up from that leave your throat really dry and your whole body kind of sweaty. I know it sounds weird but it&#39;s a really specific feeling. The trailer looks really promising and I&#39;m excited to watch it!"
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2025-03-09,If you have problem with sleeping you have to watch this movie
Skinamarink,APQqilSTxz0,2023-01-15,"Just got done watching this Art of a movie. <br><br>If your looking for a hardcore horror plot, this ain‚Äôt for you. <br><br>If your looking for a legit Scare (Both the Audio and Visuals do a Outstanding job, was on edge the Whole Movie) This is one that needs to be on your list."
Die Hard2023 Re-release,pGNv5-dyRKA,2023-02-25,"I don&#39;t get it. . .not the movie, but like why is Prime video  making  this movie look like it was made this year or only come out this year when I saw it in 2020 the year it actually come out . . . why change the year???  or did I just past the Mandela effect"

Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-09-28,"I just watched this movie and it was absolutely amazing.  Top drawer actors in a mundane existence that is shaken up by Jules.  Don‚Äôt be dissuaded by this trailer, there‚Äôs so much more to this story than what you see here.  Best movie of 2023 by far."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-11-30,"I just had to come here to say this was the most enjoyable surprise I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Some hilariously human moments üòÇ I love that the story is the focus of the movie, not special effects or trying to make Jules over detailed."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-05-24,"Just watched this movie and it is great. The topics of loneliness, companionship, parent-child relationships are presented nicely. It is part humorous, part sad and plenty heartwarming especially the last scene. ü•∫<br><br>And when Milton said: &quot;I&#39;&#39;m afraid I called her too many times to fix the TV system.&quot;... That made me cry. üò≠<br><br>Thabk you for this wonderful movie. üëçüíØ"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-11-23,"This is such a wholesome movie! It&#39;s a nice change of pace if you&#39;re having blockbuster fatigue, plus watching movies like this with old people as the main characters are always great üòä"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-05-21,Finally after all these years a movie like movies are supposed to be made.
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-07-03,"Saw this on a United flight recently. Was like whatever, there‚Äôs nothing else on, but then was pleasantly surprised how charming and touching this movie is. It stays with you a while.  Now I wish I had a Jules in my home. üëΩ‚ù§"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-03-11,"What an amazing movie which is hard to find movie like this these days, I watched it over and over again, I could never get bored with this movie, BRAVO MOVIE JULES !!!!"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-04-06,This is a great movie.  Haven‚Äôt ever seen anything like it.  Made me smile. -very uplifting
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-04-10,What a lovely and impressive movie...
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-04-21,"I&#39;ve watched this incredible film at least a dozen times. But then, who&#39;s counting?  BTW, I agree with Milton. I also think they ought to change the town&#39;s slogan."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-11-20,I want a Jules part 2 <br>It&#39;s amazing!
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-12-19,This move is WELL DESERVING OF AN ACADEMY AWARD!!!
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-04-21,"What a great little movie and a joy to watch, perfectly paced and engaging story telling with a great cast.  Haven&#39;t felt this good after watching a movie in years.  We need more like this."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-10,"So, basically, E.T. with senior citizens instead of children? Yeah, sure, I&#39;m up for that."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-11,I hope Bleecker Street continues to Supply us moviegoers with good or great sci-fi titles in the future
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-10-25,I loved this movie. It was so beautiful!
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-27,"A couple weeks ago, I watched this trailer and thought, &quot;Aw, how cute.&quot;<br>Today, after the UAP congressional hearing, I watch it, and think &quot;This might be a documentary...&quot;"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2025-04-15,"Never i watched a movie twice, but this one i watched over 5 times, so beautiful im in love with Jules hopefully soon a Jules 2 because i cant miss him/her the eyes the nose mouth everything is so cute about him üòçüòçüòç"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-21,Fun fact I accidentally took the producer&#39;s jacket home from a bar..had to do a walk of shame and return it the next day and on the jacket it said JULES 2021 so I&#39;m glad it&#39;s coming out finally haha
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-16,"Great movie, funny and touching and Ben Kingsley is absolutely fantastic in it!! Normally I&#39;d be upset that the trailer shows everything, but this movie isn&#39;t about the destination, but about the journey. It&#39;s very predictable but hits all the right spots. Loved it."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-31,This is a great risk and I love it.  A 90&#39;s ish original film that&#39;s not a remake or a Super hero movie.
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-23,I saw this movie today.  It&#39;s easily one of the best films of the year.
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-30,"Ben Kingsley has always been one of my favorite actors from gandhi, schindlers, sand and fog etc"
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-21,Ben Kingsley with HAIR!! Cool. Love the concept of Apples for an Alien.  Loving Jane Curtain in anything lately.
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-11-06,"Just finished watching, indeed a very loveable movie. And the music score by Volker Bertelmann sticks with me."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-06-01,"The movie is called Jules, and stars Ben Kingsley, Jane Curtain, and Jade Quon as Jules. It came out last year and is available through streaming. It has a rating of 85% on Rotten Tomatoes."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-12,This movie should be titled &quot;Apples for an Alien&quot;
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-22,This is the most original thing Hollywood has put out in years. Looking forward to it
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-10-24,Such a sweet and endearing movie!!! Loved it!!!

Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-11,"Jules looks fantastic and intriguing. This is Bleecker Street ( if I&#39;m not mistaken ) third sci-fi feature movie in their library. With the other two Sci-fi titles being &quot;Save Yourselves&quot; &amp; &quot;I&#39;m Your Man&quot;  which I&#39;ve enjoyed both movies. I look forward to seeing Jules with Ben Kingsley, Jane Curtin, Harriet Sansom Harris, Zoe Winters &amp; Jade Quon in theaters."

Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-26,I enjoyed his movie quite a lot for the most part. A couple small hang ups but nothing detracting. Highly recommend.
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-08-14,He&#39;s right about that &quot;a good place to call home&quot; slogan
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-07-12,"Wow, hardly recognize Ben Kingsley. Well this is a breath of fresh air. Something offbeat and quirky with an independent feel. All these movies these days particularly big budget summer blockbuster tent pole films all feel homogenized and regurgitated. Same ol stale formula. This seems to have the basis of a formulaic premise. Hopefully enough quirkiness am independent voice to offset that."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-03-20,Terrific movie. Definitely 5 Stars

Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2024-08-01,"In a movie yes, but in real life no way!  Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs ever gonna happen?!  I believe they have been here far longer than we‚Äôve been here‚Ä¶ and supposedly one of them once worked amongst the US government looking human like us and was extremely intelligent."
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-09-14,I enjoyed it ‚ù§
Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-11-25,"I‚Äôve waited to see the interior of ship or at least a glimpse of Jules‚Äôs homeplanet. I am really intrigued about this kind of scenes and I really want to see what the directors can think of. Other than that the image quality and colors are so great I love it. The decorations, effects are smooth, the alien depiction is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. Great movie."

Jules,0nrYm9Shbcs,2023-12-22,"This movie is a lot more than the trailer. I myself am a person who judges trailers , in order to watch the movie. But this movie is different. The trailer might seem like it shows too much, but it really doesn‚Äôt. I implore you to watch it and make you own opinions not based off the trailer. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Well written. Watch it , then decide."
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-05,"I love Ray Romano. He has such a visceral love for family, and it comes through in his work"
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-12-18,"I love Ray Romano. Have for years. My Grandfather was Italian and my Grandmother  was Irish. An explosive combination. My grandmother was always telling everyone, ‚ÄúWatch ‚ÄòEverybody Loves Raymond‚Äô. ‚ÄúThey are just like us.‚Äù Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt start watching it until around the time she passing. My grandmother had a stroke and was not doing well, but it was when she no longer had interest in watching ‚ÄúEverybody Loves Raymond‚Äù that we knew she was on her way out. I recognize the people in that series. The most important thing I learned from them, from my family, was passion. Just the feeling of great passion, being compelled by it and unashamed to show it. What is life without passion?"
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-08-21,"Best real movie in a  very long time, Ray Romano -Laurie Metcalf give Award Winning performances . My wife and I laughed , cried and so many more emotions in between.... growing up on Long Island with the last name Benedetto ,Sunday dinner scene was spot on ...... A must watch."
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-04-26,Just saw &quot;Somewhere in Queens&quot; and loved it. Thank you Ray Romano. Born and raised in Queen and this was a real treat.
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-04-23,"I just came back from watching the movie. I loved it. It&#39;s a timeless slice-of-life movie that&#39;s about family, good intentions (the mistakes that come with it), failure, and growth in finding a different path in life.<br><br>I can&#39;t compare it to anything else. Ray Romano and Laurie Metcalf did awesome performances. If this is Romano&#39;s style behind the camera, I&#39;d like to see more."
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-02,"that meatball thing is so accurate for many families, cultures, etc. lol"
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-03,Just on the strength of this promo Laurie Metcalf deserves an Oscar.
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-04,Two words: Laurie Metcalf<br>I‚Äôm all in.üôå<br>I would watch her in a film where she watches paint dry. üòÇ
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-08,"This movie I will see, it&#39;s about time a real movie was made without all the violence and other garbage.  Love the scene about more meatballs, can relate to that!!!  The Italians have the best sense of humor and the best food."
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-10-25,"I just saw this movie on Hulu for the first time, and I just want to say it was such a great movie to watch. Such a heartwarming story throughout the whole movie and it was just a great movie overall. I wish I had heard about it sooner. I also wish the movie would have won awards. I really haven‚Äôt seen much from Ray Romano since he did ice age but I‚Äôm glad to see that he still out there acting and making movies. I‚Äôm going to have to check out more of his work and see what I‚Äôve missed throughout the years!"
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-03,This looks wonderful. I already feel the tears in my eyes.

Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-05,Ray Romano really turned into a wonderful actor.
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-04-27,I&#39;m such a Ray Romano fan. His brand of just relaxing comedy is like food for the soul. Will watch this for sure. Loved Men of a Certain age...this reminds me of that a bit
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-08,"This looks awesome, real, with good writing and great actors you don‚Äôt need those massive fake green screens, so far I‚Äôm loving it, might just go into our Christmas movie watching list"
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-02,Wow!!!!! A movie about real people‚Ä¶.. I love it!
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2024-06-19,Just watched the film. A nice quiet drama we don&#39;t nearly see enough off these days. Romano continues to be a fine actor in addition to a funny one.
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-03,This Queens girl can&#39;t wait to see this!
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2024-12-07,I just watched ‚ÄúSomewhere in Queens‚Äù.  I was either laughing or crying it was so good.  Romano captures a true picture of everyday life and emotions that go with all of us.  Romano‚Äôs acting and the actors chosen for this film are stupendous.  They make each other shine.  Looking forward to Romano‚Äôs next film.
Somewhere in Queens,T_YDDN66Q1I,2023-03-06,"Finally , something worth going to the movies for ! Looks great !"

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-28,Im glad for Daisy Ridley to have a chance for acting in other movies than star wars i truly wish her all the best for her future projects.
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-24,This looks intense!  Nice to see Rey and Director Krennic in a film together.  Daisy Ridley is underrated and deserves to have more roles outside of Star Wars.

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-24,I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard Daisy Ridley using American accent before but it sounds amazing
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2024-03-12,Daisy is one of the most underrated and talented actress working today
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-23,"It doesn&#39;t just sound like Daisy has a different accent, it sounds like she has a completely different voice!"
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-09-26,Not my kind of movie but will absolutely watch it just for Daisy. She is a great actress ‚ù§

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-12-01,I think Brooklynn Prince was terrific in this; she is such a good and beautiful little actress.

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-23,Daisy Ridley will be a badass mother out for revenge to protect her child in The Marsh King‚Äôs Daughter!
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2024-02-11,"Was a very good movie. People give Daisy a lot of sh*t because they didn&#39;t like the Rey character. (I personally did) Still, this is a very different role for her and she nailed it. Ben Mendelson was amazing too."

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-11-25,I don&#39;t care what anyone says Daisy Ridley is a good actress. It&#39;s not fair the way Star Wars fans treated her.

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-10-02,"The story looks like something I‚Äôd be invested in, but the problem is the same one that most horror movie trailers have these days:<br><br>The trailer pretty much shows the whole movie."
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-23,Daisy Ridley is a great actress and deserves good roles. Disney waisted underrated talent.

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-11-22,Let me be very clear. The staff at Rotten Tomatoes were either high of d///rugs or the rating given is false and no staff there seen the film.

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2024-02-07,"It&#39;s a good suspsence/thriller flick. Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are great in their roles. And unfortunately, IRL cases similar to this in the last decade also lend it a creepy sense of realism."
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-24,Looking forward to this! üòÉ

The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2024-01-08,"I&#39;m just gonna say it&#39;s canon that Director Krennic raised Rey and then she killed him and became a Jedi. There, Disney, I fixed your sequels."
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-24,Happy she showing more range
The Marsh King's Daughter,FDnUVhLMqI0,2023-08-25,The trailer looks freakin good! And I seldom say this.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,"The people who made this movie were literally waiting for the rights to Pooh to expire to the DAY, and their first thought was &quot;Finally, we can make that Winnie the Pooh slasher movie we&#39;ve been dreaming about for so long!&quot;"

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-10-17,I love the part where Pooh says &quot;I have to go Pooh over there&quot; and then literally stands over there just being himself. Epic!
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-28,I love when pooh said &quot;blood is thicker than honey&quot; and it was.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,If Pooh doesn&#39;t land a killing blow and then say &quot;Oh bother&quot; I will riot!!!!!!
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,Finally a horror movie I can take my kids to .
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-10-16,Great movie. My 4th graders loved it!

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-05,I really hope that more of the characters are in this. I wanna see how this abandonment affected Tigger and Rabbit and Owl and Roo and Kanga. We already know what happened to Eeyore because he was clinically depressed for a whole century
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-01-21,The part where Pooh told Piglet. &quot;No I am your father!&quot; sent chills down my spine and the lightsaber battles are looking quite epic.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2024-05-01,Costumes look like someone just put on a cheap Pooh mask from Party City üòÇüòÇ
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,This looks completely ridiculous and I‚Äôm all for it ü§£!!

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-11-24,10 years later and it still gives me chills
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-09,"Can we just appreciate the letters that spell &quot;Get out&quot; on the window are perfect in size, and the font is a lovely choice? Really shows that although they are now cold blooded killers, they still care, deep down."
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,Finally a movie with an accurate representation from it&#39;s book

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-15,My favorite scene in this movie is when Pooh said &quot;It&#39;s Poohin Time!&quot; And poohed all over the screen.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-01,This looks as ridiculous and funny as I&#39;d hoped and I still wanna see it!
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,"‚ÄúAny day spent with you is my favorite day, so today is my NEW favorite day.‚Äù <br>This Pooh quote suddenly hits different after THAT trailer lol."
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-10-19,It&#39;s sad knowing a teacher showed his 9 and 10 year old students this movie in class.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-04-04,The scene where pooh said &quot;i am pooh&quot; then snapped his fingers with the infinity gauntlet was truly one of the scenes of all time
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,I love how cheap (mostly horror) movies of popular characters is likely to become a big genre as IP rights start running out more and more
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-26,When Pooh said &quot;Time to commit mass murder and eat honey.....and I&#39;m all outta honey&quot; the cinema erupted into rapturous applause. I was punching the air.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-07,I know for a fact that the cast had such a fun time filming this.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-03,"This looks dumb, so dumb. It looks absolutely ridiculous, and I love every second of it. This is definetly a &quot;must watch&quot; when it comes out. I can barely wait!"
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2024-03-12,Waiting for the movie: ‚ÄúElmo exercises his pimp hand.‚Äù üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-01,I can only assume that Rabbit shows up with a shotgun to save the day
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-08,Imagine if there was gonna be a sequel involving Tigger. It would be pretty scary to see something like that to happen.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-09,"Disappointed that at the end of the trailer it didn&#39;t show Pooh standing over Christopher Robin saying, &quot;oh bother&quot;"
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-10-27,Just what the world needs. A whole &#39;cinematic universe&#39; planned as well. Man oh man... these tasteless hacks are getting more and common.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-01,"When Winnie the Pooh said, &quot;It&#39;s purging time!!&quot; and purged all over those teenagers, it was definitely one of the moments in cinema history"
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,"This seems like it could have been a really interesting concept. Imaginary friends from your childhood that you abandoned become real and try to kill you when you became a adult. That feels like it could be a pretty good horror movie. <br>Instead, we&#39;re getting this"
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-20,You know damn well they&#39;re working on a sequel since Tigger is like 2 years away üòÇ
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2024-06-22,How dare they turn my favorite childhood characters into savage killers
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-02-18,I love the part where the tiger in the hodie says &quot;WHO you callin&#39; a Tigger???&quot;
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-04,I hate the fact that I absolutely want to watch this movie when it comes out.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,I‚Äôm showing this to my children and telling them this is the Pooh I grew up with.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2024-03-09,This film swept the Razzies. Let‚Äôs celebrate!
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-10,I loved the part where pooh and piglet started to chant ‚Äúits poohin time‚Äù right before they made out

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,For everyone saying this looks horrible - wtf were you expecting? This isn&#39;t high art people. But this looks like it&#39;ll be a lot of fun.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-21,I loved the part when Pooh reveals at the end that it was all a welcome home surprise party
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2024-01-08,"Showing this to my 2 years old kid, he cried more than when he watch the cartoon one...touching  and refreshing live action version of winnie the pooh"
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-09,I&#39;m predicting a 96% certified fresh rating for this.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,Idk how I feel about this one. <br>Looks interesting and gory enough. I&#39;ll definitely give this one a watch
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-08-31,This seems like a train wreck and honestly I&#39;m all for it! I love movies that are so bad they&#39;re good and this looks like an abomination to the film industry ü§£ü§£
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-10-08,I loved the part where Pooh said &quot;seven point six two millimeter.... FULL metal jacket&quot;

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-02-23,I love the part in the movie where pooh is on the floor and everyone tries to avoid stepping in it.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-19,This is the type of movie that will totally be a 5/10 but I‚Äôll enjoy every minute of it. I can‚Äôt not see it because then I‚Äôll always be wondering about it
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-05-15,OMG! I can&#39;t believe that somebody would destruct our childhood souls like that.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-01,I liked the part where Winnie went in to the pool and said ‚Äúits pooing time‚Äù while slashing a girl to death
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2023-04-24,"As someone who grew up watching Winnie The Pooh, this is beyond nightmarish. Pooh was all about honey and nothing else. Piglet and Tigger were the sidekicks and the rest of the characters (Rabbit, Eeyore, etc.) basically follow them through with their adventures. This is definitely brutal. Despite it being just an indie film, it certainly captures the essence of another blockbuster slasher in the making."
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-12-01,I still can‚Äôt believe that they would turn a childhood movie into a horror movie.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,W3E74j_xFtg,2022-09-07,"I think i found the subtle message of Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey. The movie is a representation of what happens when you abandon friends who have been there since you were a kid and how there can be dark and bloody consequences to your actions. Christopher Robin abandon Pooh and his friends because he was growing up and needed to move on and now he has to face the fears of what happens when you abandon your friends. I know it may sound crazy and weird, but with a movie like this, it could fit in &quot;like a glove&quot;."

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,Thanks for making a trailer that gives you an idea about the movie without giving away the entire plot until the end scene. That&#39;s rare.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,For those of you asking what the distorted words were saying in this trailer &quot;My mind is playing tricks on me&quot;.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-25,Tommy Egan left the drug game by the looks of it
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-02,Great cast and Mr. Sikora is in it.  He does not get enough praise as an actor plus he&#39;s funny as heck on screen.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,"Dang, I can never see his face now without thinking &quot;Tommy&quot;. He was too good with that role. But I wish him lots more success."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,I&#39;ve just watched every horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen in one trailer.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,Joseph Sikora is such an underrated actor. He plays Tommy from Power.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-28,"&quot;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. The little death that brings about total oblivion. I will face my fear, and permit it to pass through and over me. So when I turn my eye to see it go, I will find that the fear is gone. And only I will remain.&quot;"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,Haha I can‚Äôt take T.I serious in a horror movie üòÇ
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-07,Cant wait to see Tommy in this new role and seems to be a good cast I just hope we finally start the year with a good horror movie!
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-03,Excited to see Joseph in the big screen and horror at that.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,"I came here for my crush Joseph Sikora, and ended up finding a movie I can not wait to see. This looks good"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-02,"Why Ghost messing with Tommy and his crew? Lol. For real though, this looks good."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,"Daaaamn!! Tommy, King Bach, T.I. Terence J, interesting cast. Love to see Tommy cancel Christmas on theirs asses!!"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,"I remember Tommy from Banshee, when he played a skin head, he was also in Intruder, he&#39;s been around for a while. Good to see him after Power"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-12,&quot;I see how Im gonna die&quot; but in the most TI voice ever. Lol this got me
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-07,I&#39;m gonna support this movie regardless because of the founders of the film group and it doesn&#39;t look too bad tbh. I saw T.I. and then Bach and now I&#39;m beyond curious how this group will perform!
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-07,"Hell yeah! I can&#39;t wait to see this. Great cast, and it actually looks good and creepy. Side note: King Bach has come a very long way from where he started. Proof that you never give up on your goals. Remain consistent and trust the process!"

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,"i love seeing T.I. in movies, i hope he never stops acting."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,I loved Ruby as the bad guy in Happy Death Day would be interesting to see her in more horror.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,My biggest Fear is watching a trailer that gives away the whole movie
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-22,This is going to be great!! I love everyone that‚Äôs playing in this!
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-24,Oh. This gonna be good!!!!!( Definitely going to check it out!)
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-01-22,The beginning scene looks like an old 2000s horror movie and I love it

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,"Will be watching this in hopes to hear T.I. say, &quot;Dey comin fo me PATNA!!!&quot;"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-23,Thought this was supposed to be about Mark Whalberg terrorizing Reese Witherspoon.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-09,"Congratulations, you combined every horror cliche into one movie üòÉ"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,Was hoping this would be based on the video game but this still looks promising.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,"This looks like a horror fanatic‚Äôs dream! Although I won‚Äôt be watching because I‚Äôm a scaredy-cat, the effects and cinematography look dope! The acting didn‚Äôt look too shabby either."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-03,Can&#39;t wait to see this one I&#39;m a huge horror movie fan hopefully a black person make it to the end of this one
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,That‚Äôs why I have never told my most inner secrets to anyone. Today‚Äôs friend is tomorrow‚Äôs enemy.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,Tommy ain‚Äôt scared of nothing so he‚Äôs probably the one doing all the killing in the movieüòÇ
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,It&#39;s weird seeing Tommy not being a gangster

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-28,The closer we get to the End the more these movies show what&#39;s going on in the spirit realm.

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,"Not Joseph a.k.a. Tommy in a horror, flick and I‚Äôm here for it"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,I was expecting a FEAR reboot and once I saw the home similar to the Reese and Markie mark movie I was so sad.. than it kept going and YES this concept is a vibe.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-12,yass sikora is back yet with another amazing Horror movie a very underrated actor; his role on Power should have gotten him an oscar or sth
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,"TI, Terrence j and king Bach in the same movie. That tells me everything I need to know about the level of acting here ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-05,I just can&#39;t picture Joseph Sikora playing any other roll than Tommy.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-25,I saw Tommy from Power and clicked.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-27,"Ain&#39;t gonna lie, gonna be here only just for Bach and T.I. that&#39;s it lol"

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-01-27,I wanna see it. Kinda gives me &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot; vibes.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-07,"This will definitely be a good movie,  for the simple fact that we all have that something that we most fear about.  in many cases we don&#39;t speak about it, untill it&#39;s brought up.  But in reality when were all alone we always tends to do things to occupy our times to escape from our fears.  And it only works when you become consistent in blocking üö´ that portal üåå"
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-01-27,OMG THIS IS SUCH A GREAT CAST LITERALLY

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-03-18,"What Are You Afraid of and Why?<br><br>I am afraid of nothing anymore.<br><br>In the past, I was afraid not having enough time to complete everything that I wanted to in life.<br><br>That passed a long time ago though.<br><br>What is there to fear? If we would see the truth, then we would have no fear of anything at all, because we would then see that we are in the hands of the good and benevolent upper force. Also, we would see that we have no control over our lives, and we thus have nothing to fear. In short, we have nothing to be afraid of."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-02,Sound and music are awesome in this!<br>The rest looks really nice too.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-04,"It Looks Slightly Corny But It‚Äôs My Type Of Corny. The Cast Is Also Very Unique. I‚Äôd Never Thought I Would See King Bach, T.I., Terrance J And Joseph Sikora In A Horror Movie Or Any Movie Together. I‚Äôll Def Tune In."

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-11-25,"This looks like its gonna be crap.  90% loud jumpscares that wouldn‚Äôt even be remotely scary without the noise, an obvious Saw ripoff, no apparent motivation for the killer that makes any sense, unlike is Saw, etc.  Yikes."
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-02-05,Hopefully the film is amazing as the trailer and not another typical 20th century horror movie flushed to waste!

Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2023-01-28,Time to sneak in SOME KFC inside the movie theater. Gotta make sure I bring my big bag.
Fear,VgaG0PbziYY,2022-12-06,"Started as a 911 dispatcher at age 20 (worked as a dispatcher for 10 years).  The County I worked for had 911 Call taking, Fire Dispatch, and Police Dispatch.  I was trained in all 3, so we would rotate around every four hours.<br><br>It was always my dream to be a dispatcher, ever since the day my oldest brother had joined as a Volunteer Fire Fighter -- I was 9.  For whatever reason, I loved listening to the radio, and wanted to be the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; guy.  About 2 years in (I was pretty seasoned early on, I had a lot knowledge of the Fire Department, and was able to pick up things really quickly) my wife became pregnant.  At about 8 months, I took THE ABSOLUTE WORST 911 CALL OF MY LIFE.  I can honestly say that this call, I think about everyday.  &quot;What I could&#39;ve done differently&quot; - &quot;Why did this happen, when it was 100% preventable&quot;.  I&#39;ve had to write myself a letter, to the person who passed that day, in an attempt to express my feelings in words, and then burn it, but it hasn&#39;t helped.<br><br>This was 12 years ago.<br><br>I was prescribed Xanax.  1mg x4/day.  No one told me about the risks of Xanax.  You trust your prescribers so much and its absolutely mind boggling.  <br><br>I was on this steady dose (1 mg 4 times per day) for 4 years.  Unfortunately, one morning I forgot to take it.  I was at Target with my Son, who was 3 at the time.  And was thrown into a Xanax Withdrawal Seizure.  My right shoulder was COMPLETELY destroyed.  It dislocated on its own twice and then I had EXTENSIVE surgery on it.<br><br>Then about a year later, I again, forgot to take it one morning.  I had my Son.  We were in the car driving to visit my new girlfriend.  I was, again, thrown into a Xanax Withdrawal Seizure.  I wrecked my car, I was trapped (extrication had to be used -- jaws of life) and my back was really jacked up.  I was taken to Baltimore Shock Trauma (if you aren&#39;t familiar with this hospital, Google it, it is wild).  My Son was not injured, nor were any other citizens, only me, so I am grateful for that.<br><br>Because of these, all they did was put me on an anti-seizure medication.  They kept me on the Xanax. <br><br>Because of these instances, I was told to go to pain management.  The pain management center performed a surgery on my back.  They said I needed it ASAP, and I didn&#39;t have time for physical therapy.  Again, you trust these doctors.  Well, I ended up getting addicted to opiates, while being on the Xanax (still at the same regiment).<br><br><br>When I finally told them I had a problem, I was on morphine and dilaudid.  (I snorted both, I forget the dosages though).  They tried to give me Suboxone and I just couldn&#39;t do it.  I tried so hard, but I couldn&#39;t do it.  I asked for an alternative, but they discharged me with one last 30 day script for both drugs.  I was then forced to go to a methadone clinic.  This was so embarrassing.  After 2 years of that, I did the above detox.<br><br>About 2.5 years ago, I payed $30,000 to do a &quot;rapid opiate detox&quot; -- Basically I flew to California, went to a private hospital, and they put me under, pumped me full of whatever, I woke up, stayed at a mansion resort for 2 weeks, About a week and a half after the procedure, I was for the most part about 90% withdrawal free from the Opiates.  So it was totally worth it.  I never got these off the streets, or did anything other than prescribed pills to me.  I would snort them and run out early often, just go through the withdrawals for a few days, until my next monthly appointment.<br><br>I have been clean 2.5 years from opiates.<br><br>I am on Klonopin now. 1mg x3 a day, was my initial start.  On Sept 9th, my psychiatrist went ahead and started my taper to 2.5mg/day.  Its been super tough, and will continue to be extremely tough, but I have to do it, I can&#39;t live like this for the rest of my life.  12 years of these benzos.  I don&#39;t think I know what REAL anxiety is anymore and why its needed.<br><br>Also, I did a follow-up with a back surgeon that worked out of Walter Reed for a while, and then went into his own practice.  I gave him the paperwork of what the surgeon did.  He quite literally said to me &quot;Dude, I have no idea what the hell this guy did to you&quot;.  He said I am just going to be in pain for the rest of my life.<br><br>Unfortunately,  due to stomach issues, I can ONLY take Tylenol (which doesn&#39;t work anymore).  I cannot take any NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aleve, aspirin, etc...) they cause me to have bloody stools.<br><br>So yeah, Xanax jacked up my life in a VERY bad way.  <br><br>Crazy stuff.  Just crazy."

Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,0ucTl-cxIjc,2024-09-08,I got so tired of China&#39;s CGI and I find many of there mythology cgi films irritated and ignored them during the past few years. I found the DVD of this film at a Walmart and was surprised that it was almost sold out. Got curious and took the opportunity to watch this and it&#39;s truly amazing. I also learned that the director went to visit many CGI companies. He even ended up in NZ visiting Peter Jackson. No wonder this film has a Lord of the Rings vibe.
Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,0ucTl-cxIjc,2023-09-24,"Looks good, wish it was in English."
Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,0ucTl-cxIjc,2024-04-01,"This could have been an epic movie, because almost everything is fantastic and beautiful in it, even the obvious CGI is so pretty and artistic.<br>But the storytelling was weird.<br>I couldn&#39;t connect to the movie, I didn&#39;t care for anyone or what will happen, I just wanted to see more pretty scenes/costumes etc.<br>The creativity in this movie is ü§Ø"
Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,0ucTl-cxIjc,2024-12-21,"So I got a question about a scene from this movie (chatgpt didn&#39;t help). When Ji Fa was helping Yin Jiao escape the soldiers, Ji Fa told Yin Jiao to give him the Duke something sword. He cut himself on the arm to make it look like Yin Jiao injured him so that the soldiers don&#39;t think he help Yin Jiao escape. When the soldiers found Ji Fa it looked like he was kind of paralyzed, but i was confused cuz it was just one cut on the arm. So is there something about the sword i missed in the movie?"

Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,0ucTl-cxIjc,2023-09-23,"The CGI quality is still leaning towards 3D video game scene, not as natural as Marvel Universe Film.

American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"&quot;The dumber I behave, the richer I get.&quot;  A statement for our times."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-18,"This looks like a must watch. As a black man, I‚Äôm always critical of the parts of our culture that glorify the lowest common denominator. This movie looks poised to shine an entertaining light on that cultural shortcoming."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-20,"This is SO real. I remember when I started writing as a journalist, everybody kept telling me, &quot;I know it hurts, but you have to dumb it down so people can understand.&quot; How I felt it: &quot;Your writing sucks. It&#39;s unintelligible, and you should change careers.&quot; That lasted until I started writing as if I were talking to a funny friend who only wanted to know what happened. Things improved, but it still hurts."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0MbLCpYJPA&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> The fact that a white woman is the first one to stand up and clap is the most accurate thing ever."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-12-18,This is what I want from black cinema!! It‚Äôs a satirical take on how the usage of ‚Äúblack culture‚Äù sells and can get you famous but it‚Äôs not advantageous for artists who see how they must act a certain way to be successful in the industries they‚Äôre in. Congrats to Cord Jefferson and this flawless cast! üôèüèæ
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-12,"I think it&#39;s great that a movie is tackling the bigotry of low expectations. It seems the &quot;authentic black experience&quot; is always painted in the most stereotypical way, and if someone deviates from the stereotypes they are &quot;acting white&quot;."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-16,Remember when Bamboozled came out and people said it was one of Spike Lee&#39;s worst? That movie was ahead of its time and everyone owes him an apology.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"As a person in publishing business for years I loved the story, how it mocks popular culture and stereotyping. Also one of my favorite actors Jeffrey Wright is the lead. This is a definite must see for me."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-07,"As an Indigenous Artist, I&#39;m always pigeons holed into people always asking why I don&#39;t make &quot;traditional art&quot;, which is the commodification of our many and diverse cultures. I definitely want to watch this, and have been a huge fan of Wright&#39;s since I saw him in Angels in America when I was a teen. We need more stories like this. WE control the narrative."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-03-20,"The shot where the middle aged white woman in the crowd with the perfect blonde/grey bob and sanctimonious air, leaps to her feet, literally blocking out the black man... is one of the most perfect shots in cinema - no dialogue just a 2 second frame that says it all. The way people are, versus the way you need people to be to suit your own agenda."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,I have NEVER gone back and watched a trailer before but this was brilliant and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie.  Jeffrey Wright is a brilliant actor.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-28,Just saw this. It‚Äôs one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a long long time. So intelligent. Great comedy. Great writing. Great performances. I‚Äôm telling everyone to see it.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"Besides loving the cast, I have to say that I haven&#39;t laughed this much just on a trailer alone in quite some time. I&#39;m here for this one. ü§£ü§£ü§£"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-07,Saw this last night and LOVED IT!! The whole theatre was cracking up at the insanity of where we‚Äôre at in society that this is reality.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-07,"In 2008 I read the book this was based on, Erasure by Percival Everett. It similarly got less fanfare than it deserved despite being a great story. Cutting, devastatingly funny commentary on our culture. Can&#39;t wait to watch it &amp; so glad they made it a movie!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-23,I love Jeffrey Wright. He‚Äôs such an amazing actor.<br><br>‚ÄúThis Juneteenth . . . December‚Äù üòÇ
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-18,Jeffrey Wright has always been phenomenal in every role I&#39;ve seen him in.  I haven&#39;t been to the theater since Blade Runner 2049 but I&#39;ll be there for this.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"as a black poet, yep, the premise of this movie is spot on"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-12-16,"I saw this movie last week and it was beyond good. Amazing writing, great character development, fantastic dialogue and most of all great acting. Go see it!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-03-12,This is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Absolutely fantastic. The truth in the humour and satire is spot on. Great cast.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,Jeffrey Wright acting hood/gangsta is comedic gold. This is going to be a fun movie!
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-19,"For a long time, whenever someone would ask for a book suggestion--particularly if they were looking for something &quot;outside the box&quot; or something with substance--I would recommend &#39;Erasure&#39; by Percival Everett. I first read it over the summer of 2007 (or so), and it really stuck with me, influencing the way I think about identity, societal expectations, and privilege. I still bring it up in conversation to this day.<br><br>I cannot put into words how excited I am to see that Mr. Everett&#39;s novel has been made into a film. Jeffrey Wright looks like he&#39;s going to crush it. This. Is. Glorious."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,I freaking love Jeffery Wright since westworld he was so good in that show I&#39;m so glad he is getting more work and hopefully an Oscar for this movie cause it looks amazing
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-03-26,It&#39;s really two stories. Society and their expectations. And family and their expectations.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-02-17,"I mean every single actor in this movie did a perfect job, no matter how small the role was everyone was perfect. It‚Äôs a comedy but it‚Äôs real drama, real serious acting and performances. The type of movie I can watch again and again over the years. Loved it. One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a while, iron claw too"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-16,"This was the best movie at Tiff, well deserved winning the people&#39;s choice award, and kind of made fun of a lot of what they program at that festival even. Excited to see it again. Saw it in a Press and Industry showing, and heard more laughs than I can remember from an audience."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"This trailer is my spirit animal. It has captured my angst as a black woman so well!!! I am laughing and crying, but mostly laughing!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"Looks fantastic, the only question is if they distribute this properly and people ACTUALLY get to watch it, instead of being dumped on a streaming service and forgotten. Nowadays, a movie&#39;s quality does not decide anymore whether people actually see it, please release this properly in theatres, it looks great."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-07-30,Thanks to all the producers‚Äîwho look like America and reflect us back to ourselves.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-25,"This is so refreshingly original, can&#39;t wait to watch!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,"I don‚Äôt normally go to the theaters but I‚Äôm genuinely excited to go see this movie. The cast is incredible, the plot looks like it should be genuinely interesting with character conflict, and the humor is on point. I‚Äôm excited and that‚Äôs rare for me with the state of Hollywood recently."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-16,Jeffrey Wright is perfect for this. This skewers the right people.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-30,"the comment section is the affirmation of this movie and its the most META experience ever. This movie is a remake of the premise of &#39;Bamboozled&#39;, a movie made in 2000 by Spike Lee. Many of us were alive when it was made. Yet, every 25 years, this premise comes back around and &#39;ITS SO ORIGINAL AND WHAT A REVELATION!&#39;. This is the daily life of code switchers, corporate academics and minority intellectuals, and its been the story of our fathers and their fathers before. what makes this movie MOST special, is that it takes an exhausting topic, and takes the exhaustion out of it, because that&#39;s the work we have to do over and over again. In another 25 years, we&#39;ll be right back here: bewildered by a &#39;brand new story&#39;, told in yet another refreshing way, though it is age old."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-07-30,"Fabulous.  Just watched it.  Not only a makes-you-think commentary on our society but a simple yet real and touching plot, well acted.  As one who remembers when a movie like this could not and would not be made, it‚Äôs thrilling to see how far we‚Äôve come, even considering the last eight years."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-11,That white lady who stands up and claps can&#39;t wait to meme that lol
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-22,"I saw this as a Youtube ad, and it&#39;s one of the first few times in a while I didn&#39;t press &quot;Skip.&quot;"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-28,OMG. This is so accurate it‚Äôs painful. I‚Äôm an author who writes about disabled characters‚Äîbut not in the expected ‚Äúgross inspirational‚Äù way. It‚Äôs a similar concept. <br>Ow. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this!
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-12-28,I just got back from watching this movie. It was wonderful. I even got just a little teary-eyed at one point. Great job
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2025-02-05,"Love it. His beach house in the movie was shot at my family‚Äôs beach house in Scituate. House has been in our family for almost a century. My great grandparents bought it and has been bringing our entire extended family together for decades. So cool to see my family‚Äôs china, the stone fireplace,  piano and seawall in the movie. Especially the house itself. The fact they host a wedding ceremony/reception on the front porch is so nostalgic, as my aunt was married there and I was the flower girl. So special! Funny and creative movie. Great job!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-18,"The literary world&#39;s version of &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;. I&#39;m here for it -- love the premise, love the casting."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-28,Saw it last night. Been in the book world for 20 years. It&#39;s brilliant and the jokes are devastating. Whole cast is fantastic. Don&#39;t miss it!

American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-08,"&quot;The dumber I behave, the richer I get.&quot; The quintessential Black man&#39;s plight - same as it ever was..."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-05-06,An absolute gem of a movie. Could not stop laughing and feeling a bit sad. For black writers everywhere who struggle to get readership and acceptance for their authentic black diasporan/black African/ African writing and staying true to whichever art speaks to them in its truest form trying to elevate it. üëè Bravo.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-28,"Went to a secret screening of this movie last night and to say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  So funny and well written!  One of Wrights best performances, he will run you thru a gamut of emotions along the way.  At times you are intentionally made to feel uncomfortable....those moments are obvious and always sends you straight into laughter soon after.   So well done and a must watch for anyone looking for a great movie theatre experience with others."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-24,This is based on the book &quot;Erasure&quot; by Percival Everett.  I&#39;ll be reading it this weekend.  I&#39;m also looking forward to this film!
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-03-16,The peace sign from one black to another...will forever define us. Thank you for this movie.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,Cord Jefferson was already obviously an original thinker way back when he was working at Gawker. This looks like a well earned win for him.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-18,Mr. Wright has been my favorite American actor for decades. Only he could pull this off. Run Stagger Leigh!
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-20,"As a writer I sometimes feel like I&#39;m going to have to do something like this to sell books. This might be a comedy. But, seriously, it rings true!"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-03-04,"Watched it today. It is a must see and the trailer does not do it justice. Funny , heartbreaking, thought provoking, makes you want to talk about ALL the subplots all the way back home."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-12-23,This movie is a FULL GIFT. If it‚Äôs playing near you DO go see it!! üôåüèæ<br>Really unique and clever script‚Ä¶ and thoroughly HILARIOUS.  SO good! üëèüèæüëèüèæüé•‚ô•Ô∏è

American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-30,"About 10 years ago, I read &quot;Erasure&quot;, the book that the movie is based on and thought it was one of the best, most original books I had ever read!! I am a huge Percival Everett fan.  I cannot wait to see this moving.  It looks amazing"
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,Anything with Jeffrey Wright I&#39;m watching! The most underrated actor!!
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-01-06,"This film just arrived in the Philadelphia market yesterday. I was thrilled to see this. I laughed, I cried. It was fantastic. Loved every scene."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-02-12,"My wife and I saw American Fiction earlier today. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years, with the best scripts I&#39;ve seen in years and some of the best acting I&#39;ve seen in years; the best musical scores I&#39;ve heard EVER, and the closing music is EXCELLENT. I give this movie 99.9 out of 100."
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-03,This looks phenomenal. Jeffrey Wright is an incredible actor and I&#39;m pleased to see him shining.
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-10-17,This looks brilliant. Its very existence hopefully implies we&#39;re around peak pandering as a society and things should get better from here right? Right???
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2023-11-14,Bamboozled 2... Nice.......
American Fiction,i0MbLCpYJPA,2024-02-23,"I just watched this movie in a packed theatre! 5/5 for hitting all the feels and emotions. The story itself is phenomenal and I‚Äôm white but all of these hidden themes hit so hard.<br><br>This is classic! I believe the movie is ‚Äúthe movie within the movie‚Äù no spoilers, watch it you‚Äôll understand."

Polite Society,TRFM7HQmkH0,2023-05-09,"saw this movie this weekend and it was so fun and ridiculous and unique! AND HILARIOUS<br>I loved it to pieces. It was so well paced and even the side characters were amazing.<br>And Ria&#39;s arc about being scared she can&#39;t make it as a stuntwoman and Lena dropping out of art school and Ria projecting onto her was so relatable. The fear of not doing well in the things you&#39;re passionate about, maybe due to external disapproval or maybe to internal insecurity, but also the idea that you can be passionate about something and stop and still be okay and not stake your worth on one thing and. Its just really good."

Would make a great double feature with a musical remake of &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mr Chicken&quot;, with Daniel Day Lewis in the title role.   Yes, I know he says he&#39;s retired.  But it&#39;s just the role I think that would bring him back.  He could make &quot;Attaboy, Luther !&quot; a national catchphrase in no time."

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-09-04,"My head canon is that there are some major time skips in the light novels (past were the anime is up to) that are just, &quot;we&#39;ve been setting up and improving tempist&quot;. So it wouldn&#39;t be hard to slot something like this in timeline wise. Wether they can avoid contradicting anything that comes after is another matter."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-28,Can‚Äôt wait üëçüëçüëç hopefully it leads to a season 3

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-01,"I&#39;m pretty pumped for this movie, especially since it seems to take place right after the end of the most recent season!"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-04,This would explode the growth explosion in power that Beni came upon.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-08,"I&#39;m saying this now. By time this series concludes, it may very well be on par with some of the greatest anime of all time. It is insane seeing how good the show is now, and knowing theres easily enough source material for another 4 seasons."

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-29,I thought the title would have been something like ‚ÄúWhen a lvl 1 mob comes to the big screen‚Äù

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-14,I hope this will be available in the Philippines. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was welcomed really well here.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-28,I&#39;d prefer they just make season 3 instead of an anime original movie
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-28,"Oh, boy!  It is coming!  Mark your calendar so you won&#39;t forget!  Well, yes, you have big circle on Jan, Feb, and Mar as &quot;early 2023&quot; but who cares!  They narrow it down to three months!  :D"

I didn&#39;t expect anything that sounds like the beginning of a Family Guy cut away to be made into a serious movie.  I can just imagine it in Lois&#39; Boston accent: &quot;Rememb&#39;eh Pe~teh&#39; ?  That time I got reincar~na~ted as a sli~me?&quot;"

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-28,I‚Äôm a bit worried with the ‚ÄúExclusively in Theaters‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs more along the lines of only in theaters for a month or two then can be bought or watched on Crunchyroll and not only in theaters and never again. Because I kinda have university that leaves little room for much else.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-29,I guess even if it&#39;s not canon it looks like fun.<br><br>I just wished they&#39;ve used the other spin-offs like Trinity as source material instead.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-28,Felt more like a an anime game trailer rather than an anime movie trailer.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-06,I kinda hope I&#39;d be able to see the movie while it&#39;s in theaters... But Idk for sure if it&#39;s only going to be in Japan or not. Also the fact it&#39;s not till early 2023 breaks my hear.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-06-30,"We have to support fully, so we can potentially get seasons 3-6"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-07-12,"I understand why they&#39;re doing a movie, they make the most money for the show. I just wish they&#39;d make the international releases closer to the Japanese release.  I always get spoiled before they&#39;re in theaters no matter how hard I try...."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime the Movie: Scarlet Bond,M4EPHOfgOdc,2022-09-05,I might be short on Electritify in the Dark Future (2023) - so please release it before Necromancers turn this Planet dark. I Would like to enjoy it...
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,Such a delight to see these two on screen together again. Pure magic.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Here for the In Bruges Reunion.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-11-05,"Transports you to a different world. You start the movie, and 1 hour later, it is nowhere you thought it will be. Magic to see this cast together again! 9/10"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-14,"Anyone who says the film is boring or nothing happens -  I went from  curiosity as to what was the cause of the falling out, to laughing hysterically in the confession scene with Brendan&#39;s character to complete and utter heartbreak at the ending sequence and everything in between - it was an emotional roller coaster and I&#39;m not sure how some people aren&#39;t seeing it.  It forces you to be introspective and empathetic.  We&#39;ve all been through the situation...maybe not as in-your-face as the two main characters but people come and go from your life and it&#39;s not always your choice, and you can&#39;t always control it. It affected me long after I walked out of the theater."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"Martin Mcdonagh is a man born in England who we fully accept, embrace and love as an Irishman. In Bruges was two of the best Irish characters ever put on screen. It looks like he&#39;s only gone and done it again"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-02-11,"Loved it! This movie hits home for me because when i was in highschool i had a best friend for years who then went cold with me and decided she wanted to cut me off. For a long time i tried to bring the magic back between us, and wasnt able to let go. I find it relatable and painful, but very beautiful."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Very relatable problem with male friendships. You can&#39;t really break up with your friends! Best you can do is ignore em or be blunt and mean, and surely they&#39;ll take the hint and leave you alone right? Well, what if they won&#39;t? Love the premise (and the In Bruges reunion!)"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-21,"Martin mcdonagh is a man who doesn&#39;t give a shit about what sells in Hollywood, he&#39;s a man with a commitment to true storytelling. I&#39;m always heartbroken when his films aren&#39;t  widely adopted by the general movie going audience, but I honestly envy his ability to digest and express the human condition in a way that makes every persons heart skip an odd beat in their chest when they see the baser part of their character laid bare in such a beautiful and compassionate way. This is a man who understands the darker side of the human psyche and expresses it in such a way that the misanthropy prevalent in our society is given a strong voice while at the same time being gently guided to a level of understanding and compassion towards those around us and their many failings and foibles, and I fir one can&#39;t wait to hear this man&#39;s voice again."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-25,"Beautiful movie about despair, loneliness, leaving a mark on the world to be remembered by, and the damage it can do to others. The theme of brutal and nasty humans, versus gentle, kind, nice animal loving people is so well done. The kid that played Dominic was a revelation. Excellent movie."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Brendan Gleeson is one of the most underrated actors of our time.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"In Bruges is one of my favourite films ever, so glad to see these two working together again"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-23,"Saw this today. 10/10. The writing, direction,  photography, cast and acting all superb"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"Martin McDonough is a great playwright. This has the hallmarks of his play, The Cripple of Inishmaan which I had the pleasure of performing in as a teenager. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-20,"Filmed on Achill Island, west coast of Ireland. It really looks like that. A beautiful place. Because there&#39;s hardly any trees you can hear the ocean at a distance, feel the fresh Atlantic breeze on your skin, and the strength of nature on your body is so intense there. A wonderful feeling.<br><br>Only a 1 hour flight from Britain to Ireland West Airport Knock (NOC).<br><br>Friendly people, warm pubs, great food."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-29,"If you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs pretty much a metaphor of the Irish Civil War, hence the two friends who liked each other yesterday now at each other‚Äôs throats"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Gleeson and Farrell have the best chemistry. So excited to watch them again in another film
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"oh my dear god, there&#39;s hope for cinema."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-21,"I watched this movie very recently. It is a roller coaster of emotions. I felt so bad for  the friend who lost so much, he was really the only kind, normal individual on the island. I was enthralled by 5 minutes. I was not expecting the ending and cried my eyes out. It left me quite bereft and sad. Beautifully haunting. 5 stars from me."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-09-11,"Martin McDonagh is a true genius of 20th-21st century film and theatre writing, darkly comedic irish drama, and this looks absolutely fantastic."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-08,I&#39;m watching it right now. the moment when Colm is driving Padraic home after  he got beaten by the local policeman. Padraic&#39;s crying is funny at first few seconds but the atmosphere of 1920 life somewhere far away in Ireland in a village makes you understand that back then friendship and attachment to a person was important. it is a heartbreaking scene in this movie
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-11-13,"This was excellent. It‚Äôs been a while since a movie covered such a gamut of emotions so extensively, and much of that can be attributed to the expert acting by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. The symbolism of the civil war brewing and creating tension alongside the ending of their friendship was brilliant. I appreciated that we walked into their lives having not seen what their friendship looked like when it was thriving, but at the beginning of its end. <br><br>For anyone who has had a friendship interrupted or severed, this hits a nerve, but not necessarily in a way that opens old wounds. I saw this two days ago, but it‚Äôs safe to say that this film will be on my mind for quite sometime."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Such a simple premise yet so mysterious. Why won&#39;t he talk to his buddy!?!?!?
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-03-05,"I can relate to this film because I ended a friendship. It was a great film. I&#39;m glad that I finally watched it. All four performances from Colin, Brendan, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon stood out to me."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-12-18,I would LOVE to see Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan get recognized for their pitch-perfect supporting performances!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-09-26,"This movie absolutely incredible. Both insanely funny and painfully tragic, in a true Martin McDonagh fashion. Beautifully shot. I would say this is his strongest film yet. Colin Farrell&#39;s career best perfomance."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"In bruges is my all time favourite film and brendan gleeson is always phenomenal, the guard, the general and calvary are 3 massively underrated films in my opinion so can&#39;t wait to see this"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-28,It&#39;s difficult to pinpoint exactly what it was but this film really touched a chord with me. I cried my eyes out watching it. It was so freeing. Movies are really magical when they can make that kind of thing happen... They open up for emotions you didn&#39;t even knew you were repressing. Loved it but I also won&#39;t be watching it again any time soon.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-19,"I finally watched this film. Loved Colin and Brendan&#39;s chemistry in &quot;In Bruges&quot; and I&#39;ve been a fan of Brendan since his Hamish role in &quot;Braveheart.&quot;  I really appreciate this refreshing story on multiple levels and love how Martin McDonagh keeps the audience engaged--and in suspense. The scenery is another major character in the film and McDonagh used it as brilliantly as David Lean did in his films. At some moments, I was taken back to another Irish film &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; (1994) when it came to asking the questions &quot;What is community?,&quot;  &quot;What are our responsibilities to and for each other? &quot;What do we owe ourselves?&quot;  I also highly recommend watching the films &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; (2007) if you&#39;re not familiar with the Irish Civil War of 1922-1923. You don&#39;t need to be aware of this subject matter to understand &quot;Banshees of Inisherin&quot;; yet knowing the political and emotional landscape of what was happening across Ireland at the same time gives this film an extra layer of poignancy. These are unforgettable characters and the whole cast was excellent."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"Love Martin McDonagh, he makes so few films every one feels like an event."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-17,"I saw this film at the BFI London Festival with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson appearing on stage before the screening, and the atmosphere during the film at the theater was amazing. It has tons of laughs and shocking moments that makes the audience wince. It was a roller-coaster of emotions throughout and a great viewing experience."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-07,Have always wanted to see Gleeson and Collin work together again since I saw &quot;In Bruges&quot;.. Wonderful chemistry!!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,You had me at Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson directed by Martin McDonagh
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-05-19,"I watched it on a plane, knowing nothing about the story and I loved it so much. Definitely my favourite film of the year so far."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,So excited to watch them again in another film
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-24,"you guys need to watch this, I have never loved film like this before. what a sentimental yet witty play of a plot, beautifully executed with brilliant performances"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-12-24,I love this film! Im so glad that people can still make films that are worth watching.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,It&#39;s just magnificent to see a Martin McDonagh movie coming out. Who knows this movie might win him an Oscar
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2024-09-18,"All is not lost if a major studio, is still willing to back a small, yet incredible film like this, during the tent pole movie wars era.<br><br>Well done !!!!<br><br>Wish I had seen this in the theatre !!"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-17,I am so intrigued by the plot of this movie. We&#39;ve all been through something like this. Where you&#39;ve lost a friend. Sometimes it&#39;s just over time and you&#39;ve grown apart or it&#39;s something you&#39;ve done or the other person has done.<br>But just deciding one day to no longer be friends with someone for seemingly no justifiable reason is an interesting plot.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"This was filmed in Achill Island, I spent many the summer there. However if I got a pair of shears to my fingers for every sunny day I had there. I‚Äôd have 10 fecking fingers left! But seriously looking forward to this."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-12-25,"Grudge should be an entire genre of film. &quot;We won&#39;t call it quits. We&#39;ll call it the start&quot; makes me wonder how this grudge then plays out over generations. Just brilliant, best film of the year."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2024-08-01,"Im here to cheer up Barry Keoghan for delivering such an incredible performance in spite supporting role. Im rooting for more major interesting roles. The movie is such a whirl wind of emotions and hopes. I find myself thought that it was the end but the thrill never ends. Great movie, admiring such a good scenery and storytellingüëè"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Definitely feels like a play he wrote and put on a shelf that he turned into a movie. Let&#39;s just hope it works as a movie too. His styles with the two mediums are different and this feels a lot more like Cripple of Inishman than In Bruge.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"Nice to see Gleason and Farrell together on stage again. In Bruges was a class film. There are many, many good Irish films. Man About Dog is great and The Guard is excellent."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-23,"just saw this Movie- Funny,Sad   an absolute classic -restored my faith in cinema . Don&#39;t miss it"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-09-18,"I could tell this was Martin McDonagh&#39;s writing just from listening to the first few lines of dialogue. I didn&#39;t know his name by heart, except that I <b>loved</b> In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. What a phenomenal writer to be that identifiable. I can&#39;t wait to watch this film. I&#39;m really hoping it brings Colin Farrell his first Oscar nomination; he has been doing superb work for decades."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,Can‚Äôt wait for this. I loved the chemistry these two had in In Bruges.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-11,"Was lucky enough to see this last night.  It‚Äôs pretty spectacular!  The trailer does a good job of capturing its immediate charm, but doesn‚Äôt outsell or spoil .  Fantastic movie, fantastic trailer, go watch it in a cinema if you get a chance, or otherwise just watch it, because it‚Äôs pretty great!  Best film I‚Äôve seen in a decent while"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,The most Irish conflict ever
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-02-02,Brilliantly written and the acting of all characters is beyond impeccable. Such layered performances. The film is a masterpiece! Deserves every kudos its been getting.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2025-04-18,one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a while.   Civil wars come in all sizes and rarely make much sense.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Mcdonagh is a rare kind of artist, I have to say. Every movie is an event, something you can feel has slowly been coming to fruition for years. And like wine ages and gets better, so do his ideas - no hollywoodism there, just pure inspiration."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,The first trailer I&#39;ve seen in years that made me smile and want to see the movie.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2024-02-11,Gosh I wish I could go back to that little theater and see this movie for the first time again. Such a treat
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Makes me want to go to Ireland again. Those accents.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-09,"This movie looks great &amp; stuffed with talent..but also what a treat to see a film trailer that doesn‚Äôt give anything away. <br>I can‚Äôt guess the plot at all, which is so welcome in an era where trailers show enough of the setpieces &amp; plot points to predict events."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2024-08-19,"My goodness, I had skipped past this film many times, often wondering.Last night I stopped skipping and became engrossed at what unfolded. The West Coast of Ireland, a compelling story, music which heightened the atmosphere, 4 enigmatic actors who wrapped their whole beings   who just gave shivering performances and a script I will never forget, the direction ,sound cinemaphotography and editing........bravo."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-08,Gleeson and Farrel reunited‚Äîwhat a blessing! In Bruge was outstanding!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,Loved Colin and Brendan in In Bruges. Can&#39;t wait to see them sharing a screen together again.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-04,I think this was one of the best movies ever made. Def speaks to me in a light hearted yet weird way
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,This trailer has put a smile on my face after many months.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2024-09-18,"This, Three Billboards and In Bruges. What a director and Colin Farell is SO underrated"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"I remember working on the mainland near the ferries the day they went out filming this in the Aran islands hoping to see Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleason or Barry Keoghan when they came back out from filming, unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to see them but at least I‚Äôll get to finally see this film that I‚Äôve heard so much about, looks promising and I have total faith in Martin McDonagh that this film will be a good one."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"This is real film making, real story telling. Beautifully observed and told by master craftsmen."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-03-29,I was in awe the entire time when watching this at the movie theatre. First time since Covid. I absolutely loved it. The acting was excellent. The definition of a pure masterpiece.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Ah jazus we&#39;ve been needing a proper irish film with real irish actors, can&#39;t wait to watch this!"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Yep, definitely seeing this. Love McDonagh&#39;s work and I&#39;m glad that he takes his time with his choice of projects. Goes to show that quantity doesn&#39;t always equal quality."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-29,"I watched it today, one of the best Irish films ever."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Gleeson and Farrell were great in In Brudges. Definitely not gonna miss this one.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-07,Finally watched In Bruges for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I loved the dynamic between Colin and Brendan. Will definitely be checking this out
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-02-26,"Just rewatched this film again and I really think it&#39;s one of my top favorite movies of all time. The acting, the message, the scenery, it&#39;s so freaking unique and well done...I&#39;m sure I will watch it again and again."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,"‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my little donkey‚Äôs shite, it was my little pony‚Äôs shite, which shows how much you were you listening‚Äù<br><br>Only Martin McDonagh could write a line like that that‚Äôs so sad AND funny at the same time!"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-19,"I think the scariest thing about this scene is the jarring contrast between the indifference of Gleeson&#39;s character and Farrell&#39;s desperation and pleading. It&#39;s like his character just cannot compute how this has come to pass, while Gleeson&#39;s character has moved on long ago and doesn&#39;t give two shits about this so called &quot;friendship&quot;. He has abandoned not only the friendship but all feelings for his former companion without any resolve. Having your friend leave you is one thing, but the sheer indifference Brendan shows... that shit&#39;s scarier than a horror movie."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-29,Saw this film lastnigh. Brilliant from start to finish. I hardly ever go to the cinema. This film made me go to the cinema! The world has another classic!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-18,"Pure Ireland oh how much I love this country with all my heart ‚ô•Ô∏è, proud to be Irish ü•≥"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-03,Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time. If you‚Äôre intrigued by the synopsis you‚Äôll  love the movie
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-02-16,"What a monumental, magical and beautiful piece of art. This is what cinema really stands for."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,I saw Brendan and I thought ‚Äúit would be great if Colin was in this as well‚Äù and there he was! I‚Äôm in!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Great to see these two in a film together again.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-03-12,A 8/10 without any doubt. It feels like a very beautiful fictional world. Every thing is so beautiful.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-18,"This reminds me of another brilliant film of Ireland, Waking Ned Devine. Absolutely magical film. Everything and everyone in it was just magical."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Ahhh, gettin&#39; the ol&#39; crew back together again, with a few special additions... I love it, and I&#39;m here for it! McDonagh is such a great writer."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-14,"The film is set near the end of the Irish Civil War. When P√°draig&#39;s sister goes to start a new job on the mainland, she sends a letter back to him saying, &quot;people aren&#39;t as bitter as they are back on the island&quot;. It&#39;s a small detail, but it reveals something interesting. <br>The Irish Civil War left a lot of bitterness on both sides, especially during the war and in its immediate aftermath. Yet even though the civil war never reached the island of Inisherin, P√°draic&#39;s sister thinks that people on the island were more bitter than they were on the mainland. <br>Loneliness and isolation on the island seemingly left many people bitter and spiteful because they felt they had wasted their lives doing almost nothing. <br>Colm and P√°draic&#39;s sister become aware that they are wasting away their lives, so they seek to remedy their situations rather than remaining stuck in a rut, like P√°draic and so many other inhabitants on the island.<br>Colm seeks to establish a legacy for himself as a traditional Irish musician, while P√°draic&#39;s sister aims to establish herself and seek work on the mainland. <br>There is a classical piece of Irish literature called &quot;An tOile√°nach&quot; (meaning &quot;The Islander&quot;/&quot;The Islandman&quot;) that many Irish students study in school. It&#39;s set in a similar environment to the movie, on an island (&quot;An Blascaod M√≥r&quot;/&quot;Great Blasket Island&quot;) off the coast of the west of Ireland. While the book is in Irish (Gaelic), English translations are available. The atmosphere and some of the themes of that book seem to be very similar to this movie."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,Literally clicked because i saw Colin and Brendan in the thumbnail excited because of in bruges only to find out martin wrote and directed it. Pumped
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-09-05,Can&#39;t wait for this. We need more Irish cinema and shows!
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-02-24,"This was such a strange movie. It really roped me in. The scenery, the gorgeous animals, the beautiful stone cottage, the bar...... the crazy story."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,I‚Äôm very intrigued after watching that. Seems like it‚Äôll certainly take a very dark turn.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,So glad Martin McDonagh has a movie coming out this year! This looks so good. Can&#39;t wait.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-29,I love anything Irish.. takes me back to the stories my Grandmother and Grandfather talked about. I could always visualise the special times and the history of Ireland through my Grandparents I always loved old Ireland and the history. Many a brilliant Irish actor which always held my interest. Irish New ZealanderüçÄ‚òòüçÄüçÄ
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,The audience reaction to In Bruges was incredible. I always try to see McDonough films with a live audience because he&#39;s got a knack for getting reactions out of people.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-09,This is going to be epic. I cannot wait. The chemistry these two have is funny in itself .
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-07-04,My best friend told me to watch this movie. She thinks she&#39;s Padraic and I&#39;m Colm. It&#39;s exactly like that. What a piece of art.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-07,"Just a sweet,sad, beautiful little thing. Like watching a play unfold. I loved it, every second."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-03-31,"In Bruges is in my opinion an absolute masterpiece, absolutely love it. I gotta watch this tomorrow"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2025-02-10,"Inishmore. One memory from my childhood, taking the ferry there with no plans, going to that pub there which was full of a wedding party, they invited me to join the celebration, singing and dancing until dawn by candlelight."
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-05,"Well...of course I&#39;m gonna watch it. 3 of my favorite people on one movie...Brendan, Colin and Barry üáÆüá™"
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-10-23,Brilliant film! All actors were amazing! Special shout out to Kerry Condon
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-12-17,Just watched it. The cinematograghy was beautiful. Actors did a great job too.
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2022-08-04,The McDonagh brothers do not misfire with the films they put out. Every one just oozes wit and originality
The Banshees of Inisherin,uRu3zLOJN2c,2023-01-16,Irish actors are so often playing characters of other nationalities or Irish people in other countries that to see them acting in their homeland is almost a novelty :D
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-05-14,"&quot;Many&#39;s the person missed the opportunity to say nothing, and lost much because of it.&quot; Brilliant."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-24,regardless of the quality of the film I&#39;m amazed the film is in Irish Gaelic. I love to see traditional languages be supported and recorded in cinema. Powerful to hear such a unique language in a modern film.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-09-18,"&quot;If there are secrets in a house, there is shame in that house&quot;.<br>Deeply stunning."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-02-18,"Watched the film yesterday in teatre without much knowledge of it, and I&#39;m glad that I discovered this masterpiece in humble disguise. The memory of being sincerely loved and cared for will walk with Cait for the rest of her life!"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-08-28,"Beautiful, heart-felt film. I was emotionally wrung out watching it, but in the best possible way. A proud moment in Irish cinema for sure."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2025-03-15,"It&#39;s by far the very best movie i&#39;ve seen in a long time. It&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s moving, it&#39;s stunning, emotional, silently emotional, it&#39;s magnificent. The actors are all very impressive. I loved this movie very much, to all people involved in it: thank you for having created it."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-11-06,I enjoyed this. Being treated with kindness really affects the natural response.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-05-07,"When she calls Sean daddy it killed me, he didn&#39;t think anyone would do it again but it happened, it&#39;s happy and sad at the same time."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2025-02-02,This beautiful movie had me blubbing like a schoolgirl for 90 minutes straight. One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in years

The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-18,"These usually arent my kind of movies but I watched this film last night and cant get it out of my head. Very affecting, beautifully shot, brilliantly nuanced acting from everyone... its a perfect film, the best of the year for me."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-03,One of the most authentic and beautiful films l have ever seen. When he leaves the kimberley biscuit on the table for her. So much tenderness and not a word said ‚ù§
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-29,"Oh man,  this film was emotional enough to make a grown man cry! What a beautifully devastating film. 5*"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-08-03,This movie left me in bits <br>The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful too <br>If only cinema was this good all the time <br>One of the best I have seen in the last five or so years <br>Beautiful
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-10-29,"Such a moving movie. In every aspect beautiful and vunerable. Her saying daddy to Sean broke my heart.....Both for Cait as for Sean and his wife, for losing a child, again....‚ù§"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-17,That single kimberley biscuit on the table. This is a poignant and beautiful film. Go see.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-28,"So glad to finally see this film (in the theater) the other night.  Absolutely wonderful.  The movie walks a delicate path between joy and heartbreak and never steps wrong.  Movies like this are rarely made anymore, especially here in the U.S.  I look forward to more from this director."

The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-02-17,"A very special movie and very moving. Beautifully filmed, scripted and acted. For me the ending was quite emotional, and made me want to go and hug my young children forever. Little children are such beautiful things, so precious and so vulnerable. They need unconditional love and a solid foundation and this movie really captures all of this. Warm thanks from Sydney - Dave (my wife has Irish heritage so it was doubly special)!"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-17,Teared up at the end of this when I first saw it 6 months ago. A really simple story that‚Äôs beautifully told and phenomenally acted
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-29,"A film resonating with every beautiful heartbeat of a caged little bird ,unable to utter her voice or fly to freedom .Beautiful  and painful in the extreme .No film like it this year ,oscar material but no doubt will be as overlooked Caitlin was by her family .Beautiful empathetic score undying its ambience ."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-12-22,"I Have Just finnished watching This film and Its so beautiful. People should realize about How important is to love and care childrens and How This affect their personality! Its imposible Not to love that nice girl. PLEASE, LOVE AND TAKE CARE CHILDRENS"

The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-02-12,Easily the best film of 2023. I was in tears at the end
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-03,beutiful film   gorgeous and the girl  is gorgeous  as well.. the end made me cry.. no joke...    wow!   a father is not  someone that just  makes it happen.... but someone that shows love and responsibility.   I love this movie and its cinematography
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-18,"A heartwarming movie. I just saw it, and the ending brought me tears."

The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-08-10,"Beautiful movie, left me feeling the urge to help someone. Which is a great thing for a movie to make someone feel."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-12,This trailer makes me want to see this with my adult daughter.  Love is priceless.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-18,"such a good person this girl was and so easy going. as good as gold as her step father said. Such a pity that she could not be raised by a proper family and have the life she deserved I was really moved in the end when she ran behind the car of her step parents and at the gate she hugged her step father as strongly as she could, calling him daddy. She did not want to go back to her real family. They neither ever respected her, nor loved her. They did not care for her a bit."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-30,Seen it twice now. Dont know why I did that to myself. Powerful film
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-04,This movie reminded me why I take the trouble to go to an actual theater. Can&#39;t imagine getting the same experience at home.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-08-25,One of the best movies I have seen. The Irish nailed It!
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-22,Such a beautiful movie. Left me in tears.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-09-26,I&#39;m glad there are still people making quality films nowadays. Most movies these days are terrible
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-01-03,"Wonderfully Beautiful and I am absolutely fascinated by the film. The sensitivity and life story of the main characters C√°it, Eibhl√≠n and Se√°n enchanted me in a way that few films have done and in this, there is a lot of merit in the script and the actors&#39; performance (Catherine Clinch, Carrie Crowley and Andrew Bennett respectively). The subtlety and richness of detail in the final scenes is moving. I highly recommend the film."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-12-21,I‚Äôm sobbing just from the trailer
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-12-28,Brilliant<br>Absolutely brilliant<br>I am fricking crying<br>I did not expect the movie to be this good<br>Go watch it if you are reading this
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-03,I just needed to let anyone know that will watch this movie for the first time. WOW! Just one word. &quot;Wow!&quot;
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-07,I am an old man but I cried at the end when she ran after him.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-05-25,"What a beautiful, honest film! I can&#39;t stop thinking about it."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-05,"I fell in love with this film..the Irish spoken language made it ever more special..I was championing for this little one all the way through, the neglect &amp; the suffering in silence..then moved into somewhere strange and watching all three of them flourish together as a little family. Each knowing this was the best thing for them all. Taking little one back I was pleading ü•∫ all the way in that car journey back that they would ask if they could keep her permanently...then they left and I literally sobbed saying NO this can&#39;t be it surely..then she runs after them like she&#39;s running for her life..she runs into he&#39;s arms &amp; grabs onto him to tightly never wanting to let them go..then dad comes towards them...she whispers it dad...dad. my ending was she went back with them and stayed there at the farm. Being loved and looked after properly the way she deserves. This film was Irish cinema at its beat.. it was my best film in 2022. Brilliant."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2025-04-10,"I loved this movie. It is similar to my childhood and a couple of summers I had with relatives.   This girl in the movie could be me.  <br>I had a stepdad and I was a pariah for resembling my real dad, but did not know I had a different dad until I was 11.  I was never allowed to know that part of my family.  <br>Children need to be loved, seen and cared about to blossom.   It is so very fortunate that I did have those experiences to feel that love, even if only for 3 months at a time."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-06-12,I just read an article talking about this film. They&#39;re hoping to get it on streaming platforms soon. But the article didn&#39;t say which ones. And also said that they want to have the film entered into Cannes. and the Oscars.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-19,Saw this yesterday with my husband and we both loved it!  Beautifully done and so moving
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-21,"Subdued but deep and haunting drama.<br>I don&#39;t know how the credit should be split between the child actor and the director but there&#39;s plenty to go around. This film oozes with talent and humanity.<br>And those trees...I paused here and there and lost myself in the scenery. Isn&#39;t Ireland special?<br>My only gripe is with the well. I get that they are farmers but a bit of childproofing never killed anyone, quite the opposite, especially after what happened."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-15,"This movie its so beautiful , highly recommended"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-06-01,This is a remarkable and very special movie.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-09-14,"I really love this Irish movie, I have just watched it here in my country Spain dubbed in Spanish, but from time to time I swiched the original audio in Irish because I find that language so beautiful and fascinating üíñ"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-15,Beautiful film ! So tender
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-10-08,"its very nice movie, made me cryüò¢ Why the ending was just like that?? üò¢üò¢ when she called him Daddy! &quot;daddy, means the one that she hugged&quot; üò¢‚ù§"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-02,Incredible film. Watched it yesterday and cant stop thinking about it. Beauutiful and very sad.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-10-09,This was a beautiful film im glad I gave it a second chance üò¢
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-23,A Beautiful Movie! I cried a lot when i saw this
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-01-23,"Delightful sad film üëåüíù üé• üíé I also find the Irish language so wonderfully fascinating despite being so hard to understand üòç üíöüçÄ. My mother tongue Spanish, I admit it, must also be very difficult for a foreigner to learn it üòá"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2025-01-14,"Best movie I have ever seen.  I was put in Foster care at the age of 3.  My foster family took in kids for the money.  My biological brothers and sisters all got to grow up together.  I was &quot;spared to grow up in  physical , mental and sexual abuse forever.  14 years ago I became a political target by the US government for my Animal Rights Activism.  Illegally chipped and constantly tortured, I am watching this movie day and night.  It is heAling me at the core of my being."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-21,Intriguing. What a line about people losing much because they couldn&#39;t stay silent.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-17,I&#39;m a grown man and this one beat me up pretty good.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-24,Beautiful! 5 stars.<br>üáµüáπ
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-05-07,Very ‚ÄúGoodnight Mister Tom‚Äù. I like it! üòä
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-07,It&#39;s the extraordinaryness of the ordinaryness that bagged 12 nominations for this movie. Let this silence make a big sound at the Oscarz. üëç
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-07,Saw it at TIFF.  Such a quietly brilliant film.  Very moving.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-23,"Wow, what a special film. I am glad I discovered it."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-05-19,the slowest burns make the runniest tears üò≠
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-19,massive step in the irish language great mlvie
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-07-12,"Her biological family infuriated me, it‚Äôs as if they resented the precious girl for her being so pretty, sensitive and good and would look at her as if she was an alien in their mist, I hope they for once made themselves useful by letting the foster family keep her."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-12-02,"I was hoping the parents would have let her stay.  To see her thriving.  So unloved in that home.  Even her sisters didn‚Äôt greet her or treat her like they missed her.  I had a similar childhood.  But my mom was the monster.  I had a loving dad who was never home and my mom had full control.  I would have wished for relatives like that.  I didn‚Äôt realize it was summer.  No wonder the couple didn‚Äôt put her in school.  If that family had to send one of their kids away for a short time I‚Äôm sort of surprised it wasn‚Äôt the toddler.  Always crying and no one had time and patience for her/him.  The 3 older could help around farm and house more until the mother had the baby.  Cait wasn‚Äôt even a problem but it was like the family didn‚Äôt like her and wanted her gone.  They did cait a favor.  Why they called her back, who knows.  I think it was the mother and I don‚Äôt think the father knew she was summoned home.  If the mother wanted her daughter she needed to leave her husband and  bond those siblings as a family.  Those older girls were worthless when it came to helping out with the little ones or cleaning house.  I think cait was embarrassed how messy kitchen table was.  I think that‚Äôs why teachers notice right away when a child doesn‚Äôt have best home life by the way they thrive or not at school and compared to others of same age."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-05,Seeing this soon since my local cinema is doing $5 tickets! Just watched a few seconds of the trailer since I wanna be surprised!
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-12-25,I hope she went back every summer after that ‚ô°
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-02-18,Qu√© hermosa pel√≠cula... el final me hizo llorar. Conmovedor. Qu√© importante es dar amor a un ni√±o o ni√±a.... ese afecto quedar√° marcado en ellos siempre...
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-02-06,What an incredible movie.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-22,"Im 60 half Irish and been thoroughly Americanized‚Ä¶ What a waste. What a Loss. This beautiful People and culture, struggling to survive even in its very homeland has all but been lost by its children that went far away.<br>Us Europeans have such beautiful cultures that are all but gone. And to what? Pop culture, consumerism. All empty garbage."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-09-19,Brilliant film!
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-01-12,I loved this movie.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-26,i fucking cried because of this i need part 2
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-10-31,A follow up to the movie should be filmed to show what happens next do the couple keep cait or not
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-04-05,It&#39;s such a beautiful film
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-10-18,"It feels so weird, in the best way, seeing a novella I studied for my Junior Cert (Foster) turned into, dare I say, a well-regarded movie, judging by its reviews. I&#39;m definitely going to have to give this a watch soon!"
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-12-27,"A sweet movie, a simple story but gripping."
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-28,Great movie.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-05-22,A wonderful film

The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-09-19,Omg I cried like a 2yr old and I&#39;m 54 I thought the girl was going to get molested at first because the way they explained it on my movie site but two thumbs up
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2022-06-06,This looks really good.  Does anyone know when or how it can be seen in the United States?
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2024-08-07,Un film sublime !
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-02-27,I can&#39;t wait to see it.
The Quiet Girl,LGWyqty2m-A,2023-03-06,"I want to shoot a feature in Irish.  The script, the Fanad Ghost, is based on an old family legend."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-28,"People need to cast Glenn Howerton in more movies, man is a fantastic actor, a golden god even"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,"This whole cast is full of people I feel like we don&#39;t see enough of, and I like that so many of them are doing something a bit outside of their comfort zones. This looks great."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,"The first half of the trailer won me over, but the ProZD appearance completely sold me"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Hope Glenn Howerton continues to get more dramatic and black comedy roles because the reviews say he kills it here! His acting is so underrated on Sunny.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Howerton is so talented.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,We are all going to love this movie.... because of the implication
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,He&#39;ll make blackberry work. He&#39;s a 5 star man
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-04,Glenn Howerton is one hell of an actor and he hasn‚Äôt even peaked.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,"This casting is insane! ProZD (YT), Glenn Howerton (Always Sunny), Jay Baruchel (every comedy movie of the 2000s lol), Rich Sommer (Mad Men)... I feel like Matt took every type of media I enjoyed and brought the actors together lol. I&#39;m so intrigued by this, and it looks so natural and interesting! I love Matt Johnson, hope this is great!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-04,The saddest part of this movie is we already know how it ends
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-18,I can&#39;t wait to see this. No matter what anyone says we owe the rise of smartphones to Blackberry. Their Achilles heel was to focus too much on the business side that when the iPhone and Android came along they didn&#39;t see them as serious competition until it was too late. This looks like it it&#39;ll be so good.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,All these new movies valorizing product creation like they&#39;re the greatest dramatic storylines of our time.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-12-10,Glenn Howerton is so phenomenal in this film. Hope he gets a lot of recognition.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-07,&quot;The best engineers in Canada&quot;<br>KILLED ME
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-03-27,He really was untethered and his rage knew no bounds
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,So happy for Matt Johnson. This looks great.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,This was a blast to work on. So happy it&#39;s finally coming out.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-12-03,This was such an incredible production and story. Anyone in business or thinking of getting into it needs to watch this.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2025-03-23,"This is how you make a movie in the post-covid 2020&#39;s era, on a budget of a meagre 5 million dollars, amazing stuff!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-10-17,"saw it.  was pretty flawless. 9/10 from me. loved the rawness / filming style / quirky vibe of it. really interesting story, wonderfully acted."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,"Holy Shit, Sungwon is in the movie! üòÑ"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,That cameo in the last 10 seconds felt like Nick Fury showing up at the end of Iron Man
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-07-22,I remember how only executives got blackberry where I worked. It was considered elitist. So it&#39;s funny to see how it&#39;s development was so disorganized. Fantastic film for many reasons!
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-11-17,"Good lord did this movie do it for me. What an incredible film that was excelled by excellent acting, didn&#39;t expect to be still thinking about it months later. Must watch if you&#39;re already at this point watching the trailer"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-10-08,"Ultimate movie! Revolves around some tech geeks, leadership and how things can fall in place and out at the same time.<br>I wish they could coexist now as one of the top cellphone brands."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,While watching the Sunny podcast Ive been waiting to see what film Howerton shaved his head for and this DOES NOT disappoint! The GOLDEN GOD AND HIS TOOLS‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfor ya know‚Ä¶ binding up- b-bondage gear‚Ä¶‚ÄùüòÇü§£
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Glad to see BlackBerry get the limelight. iPhone and Android owe so much to them. My BlackBerry was such a better device in terms of productivity and accuracy of typing than my iPhone ever has been.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-13,"I miss my Blackberry every single day, lol. It was amazing. At the very least, the most elegant looking smartphone, and after owning every other brand, far and away the best performance for my needs. This looks like fun and it gives me the feels."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,"Howerton is so talented. The way he blends very sharp, succinct line reads with a somewhat restrained intensity I find incredibly captivating."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-12-09,"Loved the movie. Truly inspirational, especially for entrepreneurs and businesspeople. Many tech companies are only around for a short while. Blackberry was one of them. They changed the world, but they also vanished too. Amazing stuff!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-07,"As someone who uses BlackBerry phones to this day (a Key2 as my main, and I switch models for my secondary, sometimes I use a Classic, Q10, Bold 9900, Curve 9360, Torch 9800) I can&#39;t wait to see this film! And yes, I love and collect BlackBerry phones!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-07-13,"I really miss my Blackberry devices that i used (BB Curve, BBZ10 and BB Leap). after that i am really fed up in using Android for the Past 7 years Blackberry was different it was unique when compared to other OS such as Android and IOS. I wish BlackBerry to come back to the smartphone market. If they i launch a mobile i will buy it for sure. I am missing my BlackBerry Days."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-05,So happy to see glen get to show his acting chops in movies. Hes so underrated. He really deserves it
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-08-26,Loved this film. It‚Äôs a a perfect denis-core rage for the fans of always sunny too . Can‚Äôt wait to see Howerton getting some dark film roles because he is extremely good actor .
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-21,"My first Blackberry was the Storm 1 in 2008. Couldn‚Äôt do anything besides the basic and having a ‚Äútouch screen‚Äù a screen clicker if you will. But I remember loving it. Could do things my flip phone couldn‚Äôt and was amazed. They just couldn‚Äôt keep up with the competition, when the time came."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-15,"As a previous and die-hard Blackberry user,....can&#39;t wait to see this movie!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,Glenn is in rare form! Can&#39;t wait to see his performance.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-20,"Bald yelling Glenn Howerton + ProZD sold me, lol"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-03,One of the best films I have ever seen. Work of art.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXL_HDzBQsM&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> the satisfaction of hanging up on people by slamming pay phones out of anger lol"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-04,"MAN, THIS MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING AF!  SEE IT!!!!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2025-04-22,"Great movie, reminded me how expensive and exclusive owning a Blackberry was."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,Did not recognize Glenn Howerton without his hair.<br>Happy to see ProZD in this!
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-07-08,This was one of the best movies I have watched. I wish they would make a movie on the rise of Amazon.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,This has been at the top of my watchlist for a year as a die hard Matt Johnson and NtBtS fan. So happy to finally see a trailer.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-02-26,The marriage of how Glenn Howerton&#39;s character is written and his execution of the written character is awesome. Worth the watch for this character alone. One of the best characters I&#39;ve seen in a movie in many years. Shades of Michael Douglas in WALL STREET.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,"No freaking way Finally! Please I hope it sticks to the actual storyline without embellishment. Still not over the fall of BlackBerry, can&#39;t wait to see this. Loved that phone, still have maybe 15 or so packed away. Not including the ones that I fried modding and repurchased. Did I miss the John Chin era in the trailer."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,"Blackberry was the 1st one in w/ the market, but also the 1st one out.  Personally I LOVED my Blackberry, probably more than any phone before touchscreens came out..."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,I love how this looks low and high budget at the same time
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-07-11,"When I was a sophomore in high school, 2003, my photography teacher told us cell phones would be like little computers in the future. Some of us believed him others didn‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs when I started understanding how tech moves like the first to figure out how to commodify and distribute something new much more invent that something wins. It was a quick thought in my very much overstimulated mind but I never forgot that bc it was so impactful. Now look."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,This just made me want to watch a movie where Glenn Howerton plays Skip Bayless
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-22,"Man I loved my blackberry when I was in highschool. Big screen, typing was super fast, brick breaker, basic internet search. Gave it up for the sidekick and the rest is history lol"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Saw this today at sxsw and it rocked! Glenn Jay and Matt&#39;s performances had me dying laughing
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-18,I watched the first 5 minutes and i&#39;m already sold. Glenn is the MAN
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,trailer is sick! can&#39;t wait!!!! i miss my blackberry!!!! i love jay baruchel!!!!!!
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-03-09,"I&#39;m a tech head. This film was GREAT! WELL DONE, and entertaining. Hard to do mix with tech subject... But they did it here."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,I haven&#39;t been this genuinely excited for a feature length film in quite some time.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-05,great movie. Glenn Howeton crushes it. trailer doesn&#39;t do it enough justice. I watched the movie on an iPad
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-30,"Fabulous movie! It is hilarious, suspenseful even though we all know what happened, and triumphant even if just for its chapter in tech history. There was a point in the movie where I literally cried, ecstatically!...for a tech film...and nobody died or saved an animal stuck in mud. Baruch...Baruchnel...Jay was an excellent  geek. They all were. Howerton was the perfect level of shark-like intensity. He didn&#39;t just yell like a poser. It was like he was going to explode, and spontaneously combust everyone within a 10 mile radius along with him. Clever funny way of expressing the little things. Incredibly paced and edited. The clip at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXL_HDzBQsM&amp;t=90"">1:30</a> in the trailer was funnier in the movie. They should have done the &quot;you want to be great, you need to sacrifice&quot; and then cut to the quiet lag and Jay captioning that he&#39;s still standing there, seeing Doug in the window. That was so well done you could practically hear the crickets.¬†<br>The trailer is exceptionally well done. And the movie is right behind it. I probably didn&#39;t appreciate the Doug character enough. Sometimes when a thing works you don&#39;t notice it, because you don&#39;t notice that it didn&#39;t work. I think that was the Doug character. It fit, although if he was going to be the smart slacker with the tennis band there could have been more variety. When the years were being placarded, stock charts could have been shown. The network overload could also have shown more technical visuals. Although it successfully went retro, that doesn&#39;t mean overlays of tech stuff could not have appeared in the film."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-12-23,"I haven&#39;t watch a ton of movies this year, but this is the best movie I have seen so far this year"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-01,As a computer science enthusiast I am GIGA HYPED for this movie!
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-13,As a previous ‚ÄòCurve‚Äô and ‚ÄòBold‚Äô owner i almost cried when i saw this movie.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-02-09,"&quot;I&#39;M FROM WATERLOO, WHERE THE VAMPIRES HANG OUT!!&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-12-15,I just feel like this movie is untethered and its rage holds no bounds. . . I dont know why. . . I definitely wanna watch it
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-05,"The movie was excellent, but especially appreciated the changes made since the trailer‚Äôs release.   The decision to remove the statement by Jim‚Äôs character at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXL_HDzBQsM&amp;t=70"">1:10</a> in this trailer ‚Äî ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called a BlackBerry‚Äù ‚Äî and replace it with footage of Oprah being the first person to use the ‚ÄúBlackBerry‚Äù name in the film (via footage from her show) was genius."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2024-08-24,"This movie was awesome, Glenn deserved an Oscar!"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-07-17,I just saw this on a long flight and it took away all the pain of flying coach.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-20,Glad Matt Johnson is getting a chance like this. Big fan of all his projects even/especially Matt and Bird Break Loose
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-23,"Saw it, loved it. Completely delivered it‚Äôs hilarious potential. Unlike ‚ÄúAir‚Äù had no obligation to stand in awe of its characters and was all the better for it."
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-18,I‚Äôm so happy to see Jay Baruchel as the main dude. Love him
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-05-12,Saw this earlier today and I loved it. A terrific film that&#39;s definitely worth seeing.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-19,"I&#39;m calling it! This film is going knock it out of the park with critics and win an award for best picture. Come back and see this comment in a year from now...<br><br> I was right, wasn&#39;t I? üòâ"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,So glad they cast Glen he&#39;s awesome

BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Matt Johnson is the GOAT!! Beyond excited for this film
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,Glenn has really carved out a niche for himself as &quot;quiet psychopath you can still laugh at...haha...&quot;
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-04-17,Demonstrate value. <br>Engage physically. <br>Nurture dependence. <br>Neglect emotionally. <br>Inspire hope. <br>Separate entirely.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-11,"I love NTBTS and have been a huge fan of The Dirties and Operation Avalanche so its great to see Matt doing bigger projects, he truly inspired me and is the reason I even went to film school lol"
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-06-21,Love Glenn Howerton been underrated for nearly twenty years people for his great writer and producer and actor about time people put respect on his name
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-15,I&#39;m so excited for this! I&#39;ve been craving more Matt Johnson content.
BlackBerry,cXL_HDzBQsM,2023-03-16,finally glenn is actually bald like he actually is

Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-03-09,Man I really wished they performed in person here in the west that‚Äôd be so awesome to see it live live!

Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-04-24,just got back from the movie theatre here in America.  Loved every minute of it.  Very cleverly done.  I wish it more success!
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-03-01,"Mone Kamihiraishi won Japan&#39;s prestigious Yomiuri Theater Award for best actress for this production.<br>Even those who dislike live-action anime will be surprised at their own mistakes as soon as they see her chihiro.<br>After watching it, gentle tears will well up in your eyes."
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2024-05-02,Just saw one of the first performances of this in London&#39;s West End and it was PHENOMENAL.
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-04-12,"Mone Kamishiraishi&#39;s Chihiro brings back vivid memories of Spirited Away that you saw long ago.<br>She is an actress who acts from her head to her toes. Romi Park, who plays Yubaba, is also the voice of Edward,<br> the protagonist of Fullmetal Alchemist, and in &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; she is the first-rate voice of Hanji Zoe.<br>Romi Park&#39;s Yubaba is also as good as the original. Exciting moments will come on April 27th and May 2nd. Come to the theater!"
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-03-03,"Mone delicately portrays Chihiro&#39;s facial expression, which changes as she grows up, crying and laughing as she confronts difficulties.<br>3 hours is never too long."
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-03-05,"I hope this does well, because I‚Äôve never really seen live adaptations of anime do well. I love Spirited Away and want this to do well."
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-03-02,I got a ticket to go see it on April 23rd. I am really excited. I remember seeing the original animated film in theaters as a kid
Spirited Away2023 Re-release (Live on Stage),ED5Y8mz8P8g,2023-05-06,I went to see this on Tuesday and now I cant stop thinking about it.  It was beautifully done.  I cried and I laughed and I also felt like I was saying goodbye to my dear friends at the end.  I want this on bluray.

The movie adaptation doesn&#39;t change anything as well despite having good actors."
Eileen,arLbYhyP_14,2024-05-04,SICK! Shows like this are sending the wrong message to individuals who are unstable and dealing with issues that are out of their control in a world that is full of violence and chaos. People finding this entertaining are disturbed individuals.

And Susan Sarandon plays the potential mother-in-law of the real-life niece of the woman who was a stepmom to her on-screen kids in a 1998 movie ... stepmom who was also Gere&#39;s love interest in Pretty Woman. Are you paying attention?"
Maybe I Do,Z11QkNvMZpc,2023-03-03,"I love these types of films, Emma Roberts is the reason i watched this, her films are really good."

The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-02-26,"Before I watch it, I thought it is just another ordinary anime movie. But I was wrong, this is way way way too good. For fans, is a must watch else u will regret. For non slam dunk fans but those who love sports, I bet u will love it."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-08-20,"It&#39;s truly a lifetime of memories, making the most exciting scenes really utilize various cinematic techniques. Especially the behind-the-scenes and unexpected character twists."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-03,Going to watch it a 3rd time. Thanks so much GSC!
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-01,"Coming home from school to watch Slam Dunk anime on AXN Astro while also reading the manga around 20 years ago, and now I get to watch the final match in theaters. Can&#39;t believe this is real. Thank you."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-01,This movie is fantastic and everyone should definitely give it a watch. Thanks GSC
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-10,I went back into being a kid . Thank you for creating this
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-02-23,"yep, already watch it...thank u gsc"
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-18,"I‚Äôve never watched/read slam dunk before but i do watch some anime like one piece, etc. I watched this movie bcs my dad used to read the manga so i went to watch it with him. I am now obsessed with Slam dunk."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-02,Thank you GSC for bringing this great Movie ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-11,This movie its masterpiece. You have all the feelings in this movie
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-02-26,"Watched it 3 times...... The feelings are still there as if i watched the first timeee. They omit alot of things in the manga but as it is from Ryota POV, i can understand. Must watchhhh"
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2025-04-06,This is the best animated movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It gave goosebumps and great happiness to relieve my childhood. Thank you GSC.
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2025-04-01,"Just finished watching this. My life is now complete, I couldn&#39;t be more happier"

The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-08-02,This movie was soooooo good!
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2025-01-12,"The First Slam Dunk appears to pay tribute to one of the most influential manga ever written and it was done so in a subtle manner.<br><br>I dive right into it after I finished the manga and it was so rewarding to see the particular arc (story), still fresh in my mind, animated before my eyes. Direction is delicate and handle the source material with great respect, though unorthodox visual animation may be a matter of preference (a minor factor, at least for me). The swish of the net in the basket every time Mitsui makes a 3 pointer is still resonating in my ears and it&#39;s so satisfying. 40 minutes of gameplay, more than 2 hours of runtime, and more than 3 decades of influence."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2024-08-26,"I couldn&#39;t watch in the cinema and looked for it sooo much to see, but was sad that it wasn&#39;t anywhere until now.<br><br>Just watched in netflix and didn&#39;t regret it! Emotional and fantastic movie üíï Totally worth it ‚ù§"

The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-10-16,I want the series to continue from where they left it in 90s.
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-07-27,This was one of my favorite anime back in the early 2000&#39;s!!!!
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2024-06-02,"The Movie s approach to Solitude, Sport and Group Effort is simply brilliant.  I strongly recommend this Movie.üí´"
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-10-10,"I f love this movie. It was very memorable. I went to see in theaters with my brother , we both ended up crying . storytelling and everything just built so well. its a beautiful and funny just good movie highly recommend !"
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-03-03,"I have watched this movie yday. What a childhood memories. If u have read the manga, you know how the ends of the story will be. But, what most interesting abt this movie is all about Ryota Miyagi&#39;s background story which not show in manga."

The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-08-20,For years I was hoping this would happen!!!! That feeling when I first read the manga sent shivers down my spine and brought me to tears!Thanks so much!
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2024-11-09,We must get a Slamdunk Remake fast pacing and no more filler plus good animation it will set fire for sport anime genre
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-07-28,"This movie is all about Miyagi. In all their games from Shoyo, Kainan, Ryonan, and Toyohama, Miyagi was the supporting player to the starters. But against Sannoh, he was the main player to the point that Akagi gave way to be the next leader of the team."

The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-07-28,"If you‚Äôre wondering why Miyagi got rejected by 10 girls, you need to watch the movie. It all makes sense now"
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-07-26,That music!
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2023-06-10,"Before people watch this, pls watch the old Slam Dunk anime. It was AWESOME. :) Then you will have a better appreciation of this film."
The First Slam Dunk,l4nP-Zm9YAs,2025-03-11,"The movie is so good, that I cried (I didn&#39;t know there was a Slam Dunk anime before I watched the movie). The anime is so good too."

&#39;well that&#39;s just like, ya know, your opinion, man&#39;"
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2014-04-16,Definitely one of the best movies ever made. A sequel to this film would do it an injustice. It was meant to be a classic and remain a classic for generations to come.

The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2014-11-30,I feel bad for those who can&#39;t see the brilliance of this movie! <br>One of the best comedy films ever made
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2015-09-25,Pity the poor soul who had to condense this labyrinthine mindfuck of a film into a two-minute trailer.
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2014-07-12,This movie ties my life together like a red rug does to a room.
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2012-09-15,"that&#39;s the magic. everyone hates it the first time, if they&#39;re expecting the typical plot driven film, but once you accept the fact that is&#39; just about a rug, and enjoy the characters, you will fall in love w them more each time you watch it! "
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2014-07-27,That rug really tied the room together though.
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2022-08-09,This movie is simply fantastic. I love the deep messages behind it such as not taking life seriously.

The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2012-07-31,Great job by whoever made this trailer for finding 2 minutes and 35 seconds of clips without any swearing in them.
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2024-03-20,"Jeff Bridges truly embodied &quot;The Dude&quot; in The Big Lebowski and delivered an exceptional performance. The connection between him and John Goodman felt authentic and genuine. I appreciated how Bridges portrayed a character who didn&#39;t take life too seriously, making his role truly unique. The ensemble cast, including Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and the always beautiful Julianne Moore, added to the overall greatness of the film."

As a fan of all things Lebowski, this and my purchase of the Blu-Ray today has made my life complete.:)  I&#39;m throwin&#39; rocks tonight.  Mark it, Dude."
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2014-05-11,"Sometimes there&#39;s a man... I won&#39;t say a hero, cause what&#39;s a hero? But sometimes there&#39;s a man, he&#39;s the man for his time and place ! Sometimes there&#39;s a man !"
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2018-02-14,How come Jeff Bridges never got offered any more comedy roles after his brilliance in this film? And how come this film was never turned into a TV sitcom?  Fantastic original comic character.
The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2020-09-22,My girlfriend left me because she&#39;s fed up of me referencing the The Big Lebowski all the time<br><br>She&#39;s entering a world of pain!

The Big Lebowski,cd-go0oBF4Y,2024-06-22,This is the single greatest cinematic achievement ever committed to film. &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; makes &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; look like look like &quot;Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks&quot;.

T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-29,"Cate received an 8 minute standing ovation in Venice for this film. She is a legend of her time, most film critics agree to this. As an actress she is completely fearless, and loses herself in each role she plays. I see her on screen and marvel at her talent. She&#39;s mesmerising and so is her voice - rich, deep, resonant. What a combination of skills!"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-24,"I have seen a trend lately, to going back to ambiguous trailers, giving you a a taste of the movie without spoiling it. Giving the audience a chance to go and see a movie in the theatre, knowing what they saw, was not only compelling but intriguing, without knowing the overall story and I am loving every second of it. Count me in for this one."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-08,"Cate Blanchett is a true artist. Her filmography is so diverse. She is a master at the more serious roles, but isn‚Äôt afraid to dive into comedy. She is so well rounded and it‚Äôs not often an actor can play different genres so well!"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-07,"I&#39;ve never seen anything like this movie. The script blew my mind - tying music, identity, and art - and the discourse around ego, cancellation, and value of beauty - brilliant.  Cate Blanchett was compelling, mesmerizing, brilliant, and pioneering. No one else could have pulled this off at this level of excellence.  Bravo, Maestro."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"If there is any working actor today who deserves more than 3 Oscars, it&#39;s Cate Blanchett. She&#39;s an acting legend and clear lock for best actress oscars 2023."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-17,Anyone who have eyes and ears know that Cate Blanchett was criminally robbed in Oscar!!!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-13,"Cate, you deserved that Oscar, i was for Michelle yeoh getting it. But then watched this masterpiece. This was so deep and you were outstanding."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-16,"I saw it last night, and Cate Blanchett continues to blow my mind with her powerful performances. Victim or villain? Her portrayal of the fictional character Lydia T√°r and the film‚Äôs production values were all next level. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this incredible work of art!"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-02-11,"I can‚Äôt shake this feeling. I watched, ‚ÄúT√°r‚Äù earlier this week and revisiting this trailer just now really helped me understand how uncomfortable and unnerving of a movie this was, yet truly brilliant and should be studied for generations. I liken the experience to the first viewing of ‚ÄúThere Will Be Blood‚Äù, minus the humorous parts. It is very rare that I feel as I should be careful as to who I may recommend a movie like this to, because those who might not appreciate it aren‚Äôt emotionally prepared to. ‚ÄúT√°r‚Äù is forever a true classic."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"Having seen the film I can assure, you are in a treat for master class acting from Cate Blanchett. She completely operates on different level any actors would dare dream of. This is a nuanced character study that will nothing but astound you. Cate Blanchett is sure shot lock for win Best actress next year. Have not seen any performance that has surpassed her this year, male or female. <br>If you had to compare, she&#39;s mixture of Daniel day lewis in &#39;There will be blood&#39; and Natalie Portman in &#39;Black Swan&#39; but more subtle yet layered performance, that&#39;s impossible to ignore. I get why Todd Field had written this script for Ms Blanchett. There&#39;s no one but only Blanchett can pull this off. I can not imagine someone beating her for the Oscar. In fact her acting goes even beyond getting recognised with a golden trophy. This performance will be remembered in cinema history being one of the best if not the best."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-12-18,"Cate‚Äôs acting in Tar was so captivating that I felt like I was in the same room with her at each and every moment. Absolutely brilliant, a complete marvel, she‚Äôs deserves every praise that is thrown her way!"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-27,"Incredible film. And as a former classical pianist, the amount of research in the classical music world was so seamless and astounding to me. When she was explaining a Bach prelude to a student, it was exactly how a pianist studies Bach using voicing and dialogue. I was amazed at the deep references of an obscure composer Kalinnikov, the reference of atonality, and her conducting style very in the style of Bernstein (which there are documentaries of Bernstein conducting Mahler). Such a damn good film"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-26,"This movie is a masterpiece on several levels, not least of which are Cate Blanchett&#39;s transformational performance and Todd Field&#39;s long-awaited return to writing and directing. There are a lot of ways to read the movie but on a purely atmospheric note, I think it&#39;s the best horror movie of 2022 by a mile."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-05,"I watched the film yesterday, and it was amazing! Cate is more than deserving of a third Oscar. She didn‚Äôt just play Lydia T√°r, she BECAME Lydia T√°r."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-05,The best film of the 2020s so far and I would dare to say the best film of the past decade (2013-2023).
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-06-20,"Blanchett is absolutely mesmerizing in this. I&#39;ve watched it once, and am giving myself at least one day before watching it again because it&#39;s still marinating in my mind. Had such a visceral reaction to it. It&#39;s brilliant on so many levels."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-17,‚ÄúThe narcissism of small differences leads to the most boring conformity.‚Äù She is correct folks.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-29,"Tar is an absolute classic. one of the best movies of all time.  It&#39;s so good, you can keep binge watching this movie over and over."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-15,I have watched it twice and I will watch it again soon. It&#39;s the first time I can&#39;t get enough of a movie.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-14,Cate is such powerful actress. Shes been in the zone for so long and every time when I think shes peaked she brings out something else entirely. Her and Tilda Swinton.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-16,"Cate Blanchett can be anything. She fits any role. She kills any genre. Another oscar is on the way. Damn, Cate is ma queen since i was teenager and still counting."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"Have had pleasure to watch this movie, Cate Blanchett is an undeniable force. Cleary best of her career. She even surpassed her performances in  Elizabeth, Blue Jasmine, Carol. She looks front runner for upcoming Oscars."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-31,"This movie reminds us of why we love to go to the movies, Excellent acting, writing and story telling."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-03-09,"Cate once again, is excellent. This movie is stylish, aloof and makes<br>one feel separate from the visual yet slowly invites one closer to allow you to become part of it. The beginning, the interview, is a marvel to watch. I found the parts when Tar hears sounds and the figure in the background of the bedroom at a glance chilling. This movie is recommended viewing."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-07,Calling her a gem would be a disservice to the perfection she gives out in every role. She&#39;s a masterpiece of an actress.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-21,She should win the Oscar for that opening monologue alone. Outstanding performance. I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes off her every move and expression. I am now going to have to track down each and every performance she has ever done just so I can truly label myself as a fan.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-13,The REAL Oscar winner
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,Cate Blanchett is the most talented working actor today. She completely envelops every character she plays. Its astounding.  The psychological drama / thriller is my favorite genre and I can&#39;t wait to see this!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-11,"With a setup like this, there&#39;s literally no one on Earth best suited to compose for a film like this than Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-03,Cate is like the Meryl Streep of our generation. She will definitely go down as of the goat actors.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-15,"Cate Blanchett is one of the very few actresses that stop me in my tracks with silence and anticipation in her acting roles, and she never ever lets me down."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-11-23,one of the best movies i‚Äôve ever seen
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-01-21,"Thank you to people who recommended this film to me, it was fucking incredible. Cate Blanchett absolutely killed it, what a performance."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-04,"<b>TODD FIELD&#39;S STATEMENT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ‚ÄúThis script was written for one artist, Cate Blanchett,‚Äù Field said in a director‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúHad she said no, the film would have never seen the light of day. Filmgoers, amateur and otherwise, will not be surprised by this. After all, she is a master supreme. Even so, while we were making the picture, the superhuman-skill and verisimilitude of Cate was something truly astounding to behold. She raised all boats. The privilege of collaborating with an artist of this caliber is something impossible to adequately describe. In every possible way this is Cate‚Äôs film.‚Äù</b>"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"For people wondering the music used in the trailer (starting from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na6gA1RehsU&amp;t=7"">0:07</a>) is R√≥ by Icelandic contemporary classical composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir and shares some similarities with that of Hildur Gudnadottir who created the original music for T√ÅR."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-01-09,I remember walking out of the cinema and the next thing I remember is arriving at my home a couple of miles walking distance. I honestly have no recollection of walking home. That&#39;s how spellbound I was by this film. I wish I could see it again on a big screen. Watching it on a telly sized screen just doesn&#39;t do it justice.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-25,"I just saw the film in the cinema. I cannot put to words how much I adore Cate Blanchett. She just has to win an Oscar for this, there is no other way. She&#39;s always fabulous, but she&#39;s outdone herself this time I swear"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-16,Cate Blanchett the Winner
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"Cate Blanchett is one of the finest actress of her generation, in the same level as other living actresses like Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Frances McDormand. She&#39;s a chameleon in her movies, when she acts, you really don&#39;t see Cate be like &quot;look at me I&#39;m an actress yeay&quot;, no, she literally became the person that she&#39;s playing, she dissapeared to the role. According to the director, this movie only works if Cate accepted the role, the role was meant for Cate and honestly seeing this trailer already, Cate is definitely gonna give another career best performance"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-05-02,In 20 years people will watch this movie and appreciate it the way people love a good Dario Argento film now. Very unsettling
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-06,"Ferocious, core-wrenching, mind-altering musicality --- and that&#39;s just the acting. Essential examination of predatory power politics in the classical music world, and others. I didn&#39;t notice the movie&#39;s length and left knowing I had to re-vist the thorny argument on art vs artist (and am still in limbo). Like others, I&#39;m going to look up all of her movies."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-07-30,"WOW!  I watched the trailer which intrigued me - then I read the comments and decided I&#39;d watch the movie - it was well worth the 2.5 hrs.  Powerful, realistic, evocative.  CB is amazing."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-04-26,"The only actor I can think of who gets to this level of absolutely positively becoming the character, and being extreeeemely selective choosing roles, is Daniel Day-Lewis.  To me, these two are in a league of their own"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-03,Watched it twice and can‚Äôt wait to see it a third time. Cate is the GOAT.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-12,"Cate Blanchett will definitely win a BAFTA for this and if stars align, a third Oscar too. She&#39;s the doyen of Western cinema."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,Cate Blanchett ‚Äòs third Oscar mark my words
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-04-14,"I saw ads for this and honestly thought it would be a basic film about some rich persons struggle in losing the limelight.<br><br>But watching it was so much more. It was fantastic. So many subtle details, such strong cinematic shots, way more psychological than expected.<br><br>I suffer with severe depression, and as someone who is a creative, this film sparked back my desire to create and learn again.<br><br>On very rare occasion do I have this - where a film, especially one with a grim outlook, will inspire me to creative and engage more in my life.<br><br>This film is phenomenal if you have an appreciation for visual and audio craft, interesting dialogue points and melancholy cinema.<br><br>I strongly recommend watching it with proper surround sound, a big screen - and paying close attention. There‚Äôs a lot of tie backs and connections worth looking out for"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,Cate Blanchett is definitely the best actor working today and I cannot wait to watch that on screen!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-02,She is the finest actress of her generation. Bar none.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-06-11,"CB was already one of my favorite actors. I&#39;ve never seen anyone knock it out of the park like in this movie. It doesn&#39;t pander. The character is tragically flawed and she kills it. CB is one of, if not the most, skilled actors we&#39;ve seen."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"One of Cate Blanchett&#39;s most powerful acting skills is that she allows herself to be fully seen by the viewer. She has a profound ability to fully reveal herself within each of the diverse roles she plays, no holds barred."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-07-27,"Legendary trailer. Having seen it only after having seen the film itself, this is just a perfect encapsulation of what the film is about without giving too much away. Rhythm, suspense, tension, sound design, drama, hype, the perfect amount of context, it&#39;s all there but without any fluff. Kudos to the editor, remarkable work. üëèüëèüëè"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-11,Easily the best film of the year. I didn‚Äôt want it to end.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-12,"Today is my birthday, 11/11 and my husband asked me what I wanted. I said, &quot;Take me to see &quot;T√ÅR&quot;, so that&#39;s what we&#39;re about to do. Reading the comments finalized my decision. I love Kate&#39;s films and this looks to be perhaps one of her best yet. So excited to see a TRULY QUALITY FILM, somewhat of a rarity at the theaters these days."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-31,So talented.  Beautiful cinematography
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-15,"I became a huge Cate Blanchett fan after seeing her in Blue Jasmine, so can&#39;t wait to see this."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-30,This brought a smile to my face. It blew my mind. I felt like i was taken on a ride of complete madness.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-24,Congratulations on your 2023 best picture nomination! I hope Tar wins!!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,I love how Focus Features is giving this movie a horror movie marketing
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-01,"My mom is member of small chamber orchestra where she lives (playing violin). It&#39;s highly competitive field especially for women (just this year 2 of the members were laid off because of budget cutting). This film looks very interesting I hope it will tell the story about keeping your own identity versus dynamics in work. This line of work can really absorb you and destroy your personal life, I know that sadly from my experience."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-07,What an unforgettable movie. Cate is incredible.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-04-23,The best actress of our current generation.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-29,The thunderous sound when she conducts is god tier editting
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-24,"Ms. Blanchett is outstanding, totally in her own magnificent class. And the story reminds me so very much of Maestro von Karajan, his genious and other much less known stories about him...."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-07,This film is so much better than the trailer makes it out to be!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-28,"I watched it 4 times. That movie is astonishing. As a big fan of ¬´¬†The King and the Mockingbird¬†¬ª, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice similarities and references to this movie. T√°r always talking about robots, the way her feet are filmed before the live record of Malher‚Äôs Symphony, and even the construction site scene when she gets out of her taxi. The King and the Mockingbird is about losing all power, after years of tyranny and domination. It all makes perfect sense."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-24,"Saw this last night - it‚Äôs already becoming one of my favorite performances in film. Comparable to Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood, but with such stylish class"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-08-09,Wow. What a performance !  (by Cate). Outstanding acting.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-19,Such a good movie. A once in a lifetime acting spectacle from Cate Blanchett
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-06,Decision to Leave is the best movie of the year. This is an alright movie with a great performance from Cate Blanchett.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,Todd Field + Cate Blanchett + lesbian romance + psychological thriller ?<br>I&#39;m in!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-22,This movie is so relevant at so many levels.  the best movie I&#39;ve seen in the last five years
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-30,Cate Blanchett&#39;s performance in Tar is incendiary. She deserves Best Actor Oscar for the role
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-02,"This movie is gonna be the next step in the saga of movies like Black Swan and Whiplash. I really can‚Äôt wait, these kind of movies are my favorite."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,I saw this at the Telluride Film Festival. It was my favorite!!!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-13,she was so deserving of the oscar win. How on earth did yeoh win over her?
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-09,She is supremely gifted. We are lucky to witness such an expert at their craft.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,I have a Feeling that this will be My Favourite Film of the year üòç
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-28,"Interestingly, tar means string in farsi. Its the base for the word guitar. So it is fitting that when T√°r breaks the string will too."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-12,So glad to see movies for adults are still relevant.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-10,I realize how silly it can sound to say stuff like this but I feel privileged to be able to watch cates performances. All my adult life I got to go to the movie theater and watch her. It feels special and I just wanted to say that out loud.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-30,A comeback to cinema by Todd Field and what a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett. Masterclass. Indeed a 3rd Oscar for the legend.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-01-29,I am a simple man... I see Cate Blanchett and then Thumbs Up!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-08,"For what I&#39;ve read from people who I really trust their taste in cinema, this is apparently a true gem. Amongst all the low quality &#39;films&#39; we are over exposed to."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-01-31,It was a 9/10 movie for me. Truly remarkable fr‚ù§üîÜüîÜ
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-09-17,I‚Äôm still not over the lunacy of her not being awarded the Oscar. She is the legend of our time
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-01,"It&#39;s been a long time since I have paid to see a film twice in a week, but T√°r is something special.  Actually, I think I might go a third time."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-07,What an amazing movie! Cate Blanchett&#39;s performance is fantastic!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-07-23,"Michelle Yeoh could never reach this level of acting, still in awe of it"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-07-27,No one can pull off this role.  Best actress without a doubt!!!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-23,How have i not known about this movie!! Im glad i found it!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-09-28,"I am a simple man. I see Cate Blanchett, I click."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-24,Cate deserves üëè  more and more Oscars she&#39;s great talent üëè
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-10,"I hope I can see it soon! I was in band/orchestra in HS as well as seeing some actual orchestras. I&#39;ve been enjoying Nodame Contabile for over for 15+ years. I enjoy dramas that feature the orchestra not being just another character, accent, or theme, but being more. <br><br>Music drives our emotions in film, but to see it actually actively affect or reflect the character or situation. In a sense, it&#39;s a baring of the soul."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-02-02,"no words, masterpiece...again..."
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-11-20,"She is this eras Katharine Hepburn!! I watched it because of her. Absolutely brilliant, phenomenal, magnificent, a genius!! I am in awe of her !!"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-03-13,I‚Äôve had to go back on this trailer - I can‚Äôt believe she didn‚Äôt win the Oscar last night. This wasn‚Äôt just the performance of the year - it was one of the best performances of all time. She was robbed - and all for some gimmicky multiverse nonsense of a film.
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2024-01-30,Great movie! Cate is the best!
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2023-07-15,"I won‚Äôt lie, between this and Mrs. America, Kate‚Äôs acting is so Well my head‚Äôs about to explode"
T√°r,Na6gA1RehsU,2022-10-22,"Cate deserve an Oscar for the faces she made in the last few seconds alone, I have no idea what the context is but I am already compelled by her performance. This is what good acting is"
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2024-02-21,"How can anyone not love or, perhaps, even be in love with, Sally Hawkins?"
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-05-09,This looks like one of the better films to be released in the past 10 years.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-04-13,Sally Hawkins always picks great scripts. MADE IN DAGENHAM is another fav.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-13,Huge fan of Steve Coogan‚ô•and Sally Hawkins. I loved the documentary from years ago. Richard III was speaking to Philippa Langley and she was listening. Can&#39;t wait to see this‚ù£
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-05-22,Loved every second of this film!!!! Five stars all the way ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-25,"I love the look of this film as I‚Äôm writing a book with similar ideas, I thought nobody would take me seriously but now I feel better."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-27,Saw it today. LOVED IT! Far less comedic than this makes it seem. Another great role for Sally.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2025-02-05,This movie is amazing because of Sally. She is so good. Makes the movie meaningful. I love how the whole movie credited Phillipa&#39;s passion and hardwork.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-09,SOOO looking forward to seeing this.  This trailer is far better than the one released in the UK.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-02,Fan of Sally Hawkins. Will definitely see this.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-06-05,"Loved this film! The device of Richard&#39;s ghost works really well. Hawkins, Coogan and Addy are all charming and lovely and positive. So really worth a watch! RIP, Richard."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-16,I&#39;m searching everywhere for this movie. It is not on Amazon prime here in the USA or any other streaming service. I would really love to see this film as I&#39;m totally in love with the trailer. Sally Hawkins is amazing in any movie.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2024-06-17,"What with the world falling down around us and everything, this feels like exactly the right film to watch today."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-04-09,Saw this at Avalon Theatre in Washington DC. Splendid! Delicious!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-02,"&quot;Children, your mother&#39;s just found Richard III!&quot;"
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-12,I&#39;m with all of you ! I want to see this movie
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-06-15,Sally Hawkins is so beautifulüò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-16,this looks like a breath of a fresh air!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-10-22,Great movie. It inspired me to watch  documentaries on Richard lll afterwards. The other movie that did the same for me was The Mercy.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-05-23,The irony of having Harry Lloyd (Viserys Targaryen) and Mark Addy (Robert Baratheon) in a movie about a king who played a fundamental role in setting the stage for the War of the Roses (York vs Lancaster/Stark vs Lannister)
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-23,This looks so great!! Can&#39;t wait to see it!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-10-04,Love how Langley makes a cameo.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-03,"Looks VERY interesting, and fun."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-04-27,"So happy to this coming to Real Art Ways in Hartford, starting Friday April 28! Yay!"
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-05-07,Of course Harry Lloyd is playing Richard third. He&#39;s such a History geek ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-09-01,"Watching this now, it&#39;s very good, Steve Coogan is a great writer."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2024-09-06,It was an excellent film!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-08-10,Good movie! I finally managed to watch it on DVD last night.
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2025-01-11,I loved this film
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-24,I LOVED this movie. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü§¥üá¨üáßüß≠‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-10,"This trailer is very different from the first one - it seemed from that that a big part of the movie is what happens AFTER her discovery, and it&#39;s not as fanciful has this trailer suggests.  Still - can&#39;t wait."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2024-01-14,Loved this film! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2025-02-17,"After watching the film, ‚ÄúThe Lost King‚Äù &amp; not knowing a thing about King Richard III being ‚Äúlost‚Äù, I thought the film took liberties with the attempts by the University to eliminate the lead of Phillipa Langley not only at the excavation but any acknowledgement of her leading the search &amp; location of the lost King.  The epitome of the UK version of Stolen Valor."
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-24,I so can&#39;t wait!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2024-08-08,I love this movie - it is grandious!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-02-02,Entertaining !!!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-20,Hey there&#39;s that great guy from Full Monty and Knight&#39;sTale!
The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-03-21,This looks quite good.

The Lost King,TXxRfhQFuV4,2023-11-24,This trailer is so misleading. It&#39;s not a comedy at all. But it&#39;s a great film. And one of 2023&#39;s best IMO

To this day it is,  without a doubt, the greatest movie experience in my life. My mom didnt let me see Two Towers (Cant remember when Fellowship was shown) , but I saw them both on DVD maybe 20 times before RotK came, so the hype was real.

I have yet to see a movie be given this level of dedication since. The costumes, the pacing, the coordination of the people, parades and action. And especially the speeches. I can&#39;t tell you what it was like to see these for the first time in the theater, before most knew what it really was. What it was like when movies lived up to the hype, and blew you away."

These were the only movies he&#39;d ever get excited for, and actually respect and really enjoy.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-11-09,"It sounds so funny to think back to when these movies came out in theatres. When I say the Hype was EVERYWHERE. You literally couldn&#39;t not see it. For 3 years it was the height of almost everybody&#39;s year. The experience will probably never be matched honestly. I mean when theatres let out after ROTK, the atmosphere was like how it probably felt in Gondor during Aragorns coronation. Strangers were hugging each other (*I&#39;m dead serious), grown Men wept without shame, it was amazing. Honestly probably one of the closest times we ever came to World Peace üòÖ"

We&#39;d only just got broadband at the start of 2003 and I spent all my time on the family computer browsing the LotR forums and watching the trailer again and again.<br><br>It was only twenty years ago but it really does feel like a lifetime. The trailer, however, is as good today as it was when it first came out. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is truly timeless."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2014-03-26,"I remember when the movie came out. I was so excited and couldnt wait to see it. I was sure though I wouldnt see it on opening day. That day, after I got home from school, I relaxed at home for a bit but then mom and dad said they were going to see a movie and told me to come along. I knew though it wouldnt be Return of the King since they never saw the other movies. But when we got to the theatre and got our tickets they said the movie and I just jumped up and down in excitement.<br><br>We had to wait in line for an hour and a half in front of the theatre. The people coming out from the previous showing were cheering and I knew it would be good. 3 and a half hours later, I came out with a huge smile on my face and almost crying.<br><br>I still watch the films to this day. :)"
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2017-12-17,"I was recently off work sick and decided to watch the LOTR trilogy. It brought back so many amazing memories. I remember my dad taking me to see FOTR when I was in grade 6 and it was amazing. I saw ROTK five times in theatres and each time I saw it I fell more in love with it. This trilogy, these movies will always be my number one favourite until the day I die.  Nothing will ever compare to these movies. Bless you Peter Jackson on creating a masterpiece of a trilogy!"

I love Frodo‚Äôs and Sam‚Äôs friendship so much. Sam is an amazing friend. And the hug Frodo gives Sam at the very end before he left made me cry so hard. Absolutely fantastic movies and I‚Äôm glad I was able to watch them for the first time because I‚Äôm sure fans wish they can watch them for the first time again. Some of the best movies I have ever seen wow üò≠ And the music is beautiful and emotional üò≠"

After all these years it&#39;s one film that still gives me chills, even though I&#39;ve seen it countless times after on VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray. Following the trilogy over three years, from 2001-2003, felt like a journey in itself, I will never forget the clash of feelings I felt when the credits first began to roll. Thank you Tolkien, and Peter Jackson, for making a timeless masterpiece."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2018-02-26,"That moment when you&#39;ve watched the movie so many times that you know which scenes from the trailer didn&#39;t make it into the actual film simply because you don&#39;t recognize them, or that Aragorn&#39;s speech in this is a different take than the one in the finished product because the inflections are different :)"

An amazing conclusion to an amazing trilogy. I hope Peter Jackson can look back on these films and what made them great, and look on to The Hobbit films now and what people don&#39;t like about them and learn a valuable lesson from it all."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2017-01-28,"I saw this movie 11 times in the theater during its original run. That&#39;s once a week for almost three months. I can&#39;t imagine doing that today, with ticket prices as they are. And frankly, there hasn&#39;t been a movie since that I&#39;ve HAD to see it again like I did with Return of the King."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2022-07-17,The one good thing the Amazon series is doing is getting me back to watching all of these again.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2014-11-19,The Hobbit movies look like animation compared to this trilogy. CGI was way overutilized. 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2016-10-03,"It&#39;s been 13 years and this trailer still gives me goosebumps. Never again will we see a trilogy so amazing and everlasting. Kudos Peter Jackson, you are my hero"

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2020-08-16,"&quot;Not for ourselves, but we can give Frodo a chance&quot; Aragorn was ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to defeat Sauron."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2015-04-11,Literally the saddest movie I still have ever seen! I still cry at the end in 2015.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2014-01-28,"I know those movies by heart, but even the trailers give me chills.¬†<br>They are the bests of all time."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2023-10-16,"I was 13 years old, sitting at a computer with a dialup connection waiting nearly 20 minutes for this trailer to load into a small, extremely compressed video window. Memories, man."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2015-11-17,Best trilogy in the world!
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2016-06-22,I am legitimately crying. Sam at the end there made me feel like I&#39;ve never seen the movie before.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2023-11-09,"My dad bought the cds of the trilogy when I was a wee boy. I can&#39;t seem to recall watching it back then. After having finished watching all three, I&#39;m at peace. The Return Of The King is perhaps the most epic film I&#39;ve seen in my life. Even 4hrs weren&#39;t enough for me. I wanted more! <br>I had tears all formed in line to roll down in the final scenes. Although I wish I had seen them years ago, I&#39;m glad I saw it now. They&#39;ll stick with me forever. These aren&#39;t just movies, but a lot more. Thank goodness. <br><b>9th November 2023</b>"
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2014-11-21,"I was 13 years old when my uncle told me they were filming LOTR, so he gave me the books and I read them, then I got hooked..<br>Then, a few months later the premiere was in school week at night and my mum was awesome because she let us go to the premiere at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5X-hFf6Bwo"">00:00</a> to watch the movie. It was phenomenal! I got back home around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5X-hFf6Bwo&amp;t=270"">4:30</a> and still got to go to school but It was worth it. After that It became a family tradition to go that late at night.<br>I will never forget being thrilled watching the helm&#39;s deep battle in theaters with all the fans clapping and laughing together, it was an epic experience, now is really hard to go to cinemas and experience the same thing with everyone. I will never forget the incredible experience of watching LOTR, I&#39;m glad I was mature enough to go to the cinemas and appreciate this movies. I will always be grateful to Tolkien and Peter Jackson.<br>I know the hobbit aren&#39;t as great as the LOTR, but the excitement of the fans in the theaters is whats makes me go each year, and this movies still give me a little taste of LOTR, so I will always welcome that ^^.<br>Now I hope Peter picks The Silmarillion, some of its chapters will become awesome movies!!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2013-12-15,best film of all time.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-02-03,Honestly one of the most motivating trailers I&#39;ve ever seen
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-11-30,This is simply one of the best Trailers that was ever made.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-11-21,21 years later and this trailer still slaps!
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2022-09-02,I needed to refresh myself with this after Rings of Power
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-01-10,"I was a senior in high school 20 years ago this month when this was in theaters. Tonight they‚Äôre rereleasing this film, and I‚Äôm still that same 18 year old kid on the inside waiting in excitement to see it. Some things never change, and that‚Äôs how it should be."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2018-11-04,I remember watching this movie the very first day of its screening. It is hard to explain all the hype waiting for the last chapter of this amazing journey - I remember all the audience holding its breath and myself crying the whole last hour of the movie - and I wasn‚Äôt the only one.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2021-12-06,The most epic film series ever made. Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 20 years since the Fellowship of the Ring came out üò¢ I was 11 at the time and the film completely blew me away.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2024-05-14,Need to see this after the new Rings of Power Trailer..
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2020-11-27,"I remember watching this in the theater with my sisters on December as a Christmas gift from the eldest one. I was 9 years old. And it was one of the best Christmas gifts of my life. Amazing novie. Never get sick of watching it over over again for years. By the way, this film is 17 years old, nearly two decades, and it still looks incredible!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2013-12-18,"Today a decade old, aging like a good wine! My favourite trilogy of all time! A movie I will still watch at the age of eighty."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2020-02-27,Not only the best trilogy in history but possibly also the best trailers in history.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2016-03-28,I just watched this after watching the Battle of Five Armies trailer and its obvious why this is simply better cinema and a better treatment of Tolkein&#39;s work.  All the characters are confused in the hobbit series.  Here it is the classic and never ending struggle.  Its a shame that they could not recapture this with the Hobbit series because it was still there in Tolkein&#39;s writing.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2022-10-29,Love this movie so much. Seeing it in theaters was one of the best experiences of my life.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King2023 Re-release (20th Anniversary),r5X-hFf6Bwo,2023-03-31,"I remember watching this trailer as a 12 year old the day it dropped, waited like an hour for it to buffer. It&#39;s seared into my brain. We&#39;ll never see anything like this trilogy ever again."

Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-06-14,this movie hits hard when your closing ur eyes
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-03-07,I burst in to tears when Strange World Guy said &quot;This is truly...a Strange World&quot; üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,Remember when movie trailers were supposed to make you WANT to see the whole movie instead of giving you the important plot points?
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-29,Everyone: ‚ÄúSo are you ever gonna do any 2D animated films again?‚Äù<br><br>Disney: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù üôÇ
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,"Somehow I now know everything that happens in the movie, yet simultaneously I have no idea what it&#39;s about or why I should watch it"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-30,The Box Checking/ Ticking was off the charts in this movies writers room.  üòÇü§£ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-17,I‚Äôm glad people are finally seeing Disney‚Äôs obvious drop in quality
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-24,Boy I sure do love having the major plot beats and plot twists revealed in the trailer
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-23,I love it because it reminds me of my dad who abandoned me to live on an alien planet. This movie hits home.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-09-16,This movie wasn‚Äôt terrible. If only Disney promoted it more.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-16,"Bring intelligent, more serious writing, actually beautiful songs, and traditional animation back. If Disney and DreamWorks won‚Äôt do it, someone else start. Disney has definitely lost its magic."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,"This definitely looks good, no doubt, but I really hope one day we get another hand drawn Disney movie again!!!"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-18,"This will make Lightyear look like a massive blockbuster, lol."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-06-19,Gonna watch it just to spite all the cry babies in the comments that just have come to cope and cry.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-26,I love the bit where nobody watched and Disney panicked
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-30,"Disney, I&#39;m a fan.... Of your old movies."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-13,Disney should work on their marketing team.I didn&#39;t know this movie existed.....ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2024-06-07,Nah Disney ain&#39;t disneyingüíÄüíÄ
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,"I&#39;m here because I heard this movie bombed. To all the VFX artists that worked insane over time hours for this movie, you have my sympathy."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-25,For something titled &quot;strange&quot; it sure looks &quot;familiar&quot; like a lot of other movies.<br><br>Also Disney just doesn&#39;t know how to do trailers any more - I feel like I watched 90% of the movie.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-01,I literally had no idea this movie existed.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-24,"I&#39;m going to guess that Disney was nervous about heavily standing behind a movie with so much of an LGBT friendly position, where the boy liked a boy and there was an interracial couple with a darker black woman. Middle America trembles, grandma in the corner clutching her pearls, aggressively religious uncle exclaiming &quot;this is why the country is going to crumble!&quot;. &quot;leave our kids alone!&quot; screams mom who forces her kids to go to Sunday school.<br><br>Hence the lack of advertising."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-22,I like how Disney mixes things up once in a while and doesn&#39;t just do fairy tales or musicals (or both)!
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-28,"I would have expected Pixar to make a movie like this, based on the pitch ¬¥what if dads had emotions‚Äô"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-25,$180M budget and only a $4.2M opening day. This movie already tanked.  LOL
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2025-02-05,THIS caused a teacher to be suspended and disciplined? I cannot believe this..
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,2013: Do you mind if I call you Olaf<br>2019: Do you mind if I call you Gale<br>2022: Do you mind if I call you Splat
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,I wish the trailer was like an old Disney trailer back in the 50‚Äôs like they did with the teaser one
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-22,that was very impressive
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-29,Disney executives must have a money allergy.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-26,"Disney disabled the dog by removing a leg. Disney also disabled their animation department by filling it with hacks.<br>It&#39;s like poetry, it rhymes."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-16,I miss movies like The Lion King and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Masterpieces.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,it gives me ducktales and Atlantis vibes. With a old comic book feel. Exciting
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2024-08-17,I don&#39;t know why people say that this movie was really bad when it kind of look interesting
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-10-21,Disney animation and writing really has taken a nosedive.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-01,"A week after it opened in theaters, and more people have heard about it being a bomb at the box office than people who actually went to the cinemas to watch it"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-22,"I really like how they have some voice lines visibly not syncing up with the character animations in the trailer. It&#39;s the next step in the evolution of ADR. Once they just inserted the voice clip when the character wasn&#39;t on-screen, now they don&#39;t even care anymore."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-29,"I hope Disney makes more movies like this, so they ultimately will go out of Biz!"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-19,"So glad I watched this trailer, it saved me from watching the whole thing üòä"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,The father being alive kind of feels like a huge spoiler. Who the hell are mixing these trailers!?
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-26,You know a film is bad when people don&#39;t even pirate it.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-27,"In the past you had to keep kids from watching horror, now you have to keep them from watching cartoons"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-30,It&#39;s straight up depressing that this is where and what Disney movies have become. I&#39;m so glad I grew up with the older Disney movies that still had magic..
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,This feels like a 2022 young Hollywood writers room went and put themselves in a movie. <br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be fun for their immediate families to watch.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-30,The Trailer Has More Views Than The Actual Movie Will Get <br>Good Job Disney üëèüèº NOT
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-03-17,I finally understood why this trailer felt so weird. All of the dialogue in this trailer are dubbed over the original footage. If you look at the mouths none of the lines match up. Not sure why they barely chose to keep a single shot where the audio actually matched the scene.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-26,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKh2G73gCCs&amp;t=95"">1:35</a> &quot;Do you mind if I call you Covid-19?&quot;"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-24,"Ahhh The many eras and generations of Disney: Classic, Renaissance, Frozen, Family Therapy session ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,I love it when the main character said &#39;It&#39;s strange time&#39; and proceeds to strange all of his enemies. Truly one of the movies of all time.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-28,"Its midnight and i just finished watching it and although the trailer is not well executed (lets be real), I really liked it. I might give it another watch in the morning just to know if i&#39;m just tripping but as of right now, its pretty good. There&#39;s bit of the plot that may need some more in depth explanation though but otherwise, really loved the visuals and concept in this movie. Likable characters, smooth animation ugh! It has potential. I just wish it has been advertised more by Disney."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-27,That part where John Connor saves the world is priceless.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,I miss Treasure Planet.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-26,The trailer tells you the whole story
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,It&#39;s weird to think how hated Disney is now. What a shame.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-30,Just came here out of morbid curiosity.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-03,You haven&#39;t heard of Strange World until now because even Disney are embarrassed they made this movie.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-16,"People&#39;s complaints with the trailer revealing &quot;all major plot points and twists&quot; are not really valid because if you have watched the film, you see that there are bigger twists and lessons that are revealed. The messages of this film are quite solid, respecting the environment and not being selfish, and learning that you can love your family without everyone being the same are some of them which stood out to me and were not immediately evident from this trailer."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-29,It‚Äôs almost like Disney is actively trying to set a record for the most box office bombs in one year üíÄ
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,like seriously there stories and animations are the best
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-08,"The designs of some of the characters, especially the MC&#39;s, remind me of Hotel Transylvania. It&#39;s the eyes, vertical oval shape and how close together the eyes are."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-24,"WHAT A SHAME MAAAAAAAN! :/<br>I‚Äôm extremely sad!!!!!!!! <br>Old Disney cartoons was WAAAY BETTER!!  Good adventures, great stories, Man-Women happy ending love stories‚Ä¶. I miss that. <br>The world changed a lot. (My opinion.)"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-29,"I love when the main character said ‚Äúit‚Äôs stranging time‚Äù, then proceeded to strange all over the bad guys."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-02,"This looks more like a Dreamworks movie. I saw the poster of it at the theater, thinking it was for a movie coming out in 2023.  After watching the trailer it looks like something that would come out in early 2010&#39;s."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,I&#39;m loving this its like nostalgia from the days when disney made crappy straight to vhs movies
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-14,Disney movie names just getting better and better Fr so unique
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,Glad to see Jake and Dennis take on more voice roles. They have the perfect voices for animation and comedy.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-25,This was the cliff notes version of the entire movie.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,"48K likes, 43k dislikes. This trailer is doing so well."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2024-01-16,you know it‚Äôs bad when people are literally just realising this movie exists
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-26,A White father. A Black mother. A homosexual son and a three legged dog. Diversity.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-06,"All this movie makes me wanna do is watch Treasure Planet. You know Disney, it&#39;d be nice if you did some cartoon animations once in a while. Dreamworks and Pixar styled movies are great I love them the 3D animations, but Disney I feel like honestly ur way more well known for cartoon styled animation. Seriously I feel like this movie would&#39;ve been so much better had it been cartoon drawn animation because it would&#39;ve looked more appealing overall!"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,This looks like a hardcore father-son story.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-14,"Turning Red, Encanto, and then this? Disney is really doing a great job of telling stories about breaking generational trauma and expectations. I love how today‚Äôs generation have stories like these :)"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,Anyone else notice how many movies are being put out right now? Seems like so many
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-22,i feel like this movie has already come out like 10 times before but with different coats of paint
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,"It is funny how pixar can show a great trailer of elemental without showing nothing of the plot, meanwhile disney just literally spoils half the movie in their trailer"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-11-22,"The problem with Disney is that they never put the name of the director in front. The director is the reason why the movie will be  good or bad. DON HALL (Big Hero 6) directed Strange World. If you liked Big H 6, you will like this one. Same director, same music composer."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-26,"You know... looking at this trailer, I miss Disney&#39;s traditional animation. Just a little bit..."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-30,This world we&#39;re living in is a pretty strange world too :))))
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-11,i swear disney forgot they made this movie
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-27,"When strange guy said it&#39;s stranging time and then he stranged all over them , definitely one of the movies of all time"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-27,"After seeing some of their movies lately, I&#39;m not so sure I want to get excited for this."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-29,"Thanks for revealing 70% of the movie, I don&#39;t need to pay a cinema ticket now :)"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-12-04,Seems like a movie you could watch once and then be okay with never seeing it again
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-20,Man if the dislike counter was still a thing. Holy fuck
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-10-25,"Some trailers have really bad ‚Äúdesync‚Äù were they clearly pulled the audio and the visuals from two separate scenes. But this one takes the cake. Almost everything doesn‚Äôt match up and it‚Äôs more than obvious. I don‚Äôt know why studios do it, but it just makes the product look cheaper for no apparent reason."
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-26,Went woke and went broke this long weekend. Bombed hard. Who could have guessed.
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-28,So diverse! My wife‚Äôs boyfriend is going to love this!
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-01-12,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKh2G73gCCs&amp;t=129"">2:09</a>- Disney when Strange World Bombs at the box office"
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-09-21,Finally! A Jules Verne inspired adventure!
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-09,Feels and looks like done before a million times. Goodbye Disney
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-29,I&#39;ve never heard about this movie until what? Five minutes ago? And now I&#39;ve already seen it all!
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2023-10-03,Why people hate this movie so much? Its actually a very good movie
Strange World,bKh2G73gCCs,2022-11-26,Man it sure would have been interesting if they went way further with the pulp adventure/horror aesthetic and wrote the characters accordingly.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-12,"I don‚Äôt know why, but I was so moved by the scene of them riding their bikes in different directions when they hit a fork in the road"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-18,As someone who worked in child care for 9 plus years I have strong feeling what this movie may be about and I‚Äôm glad to see it. I think this movie will discuss and show us that age where young boys are soft and best of friends. It will then show the transition of when boy develop the idea of being distant and not being able to be emotionally open with one another. I can‚Äôt wait to see it. And even if I guess wrong the movie still looks good.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-18,"Before anyone argues that the conversation around this film must inevitably be lgbtq and the interpretation has to conclude queerness between these two characters, can we agree that it&#39;s ok to allow a story between two same-sex characters to be about heterosexual friendship? Homophobia is one topic in this film, but I think toxic masculinity and the inability to be affectionate with male friends without being labeled is the bigger topic."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,Oh boy this looks like a heartbreaker.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-12,Exactly my point! Girl friends can be seen holding hands and heads on necks. But society norms deem it ‚Äúgay‚Äù if two boys were to do it. Sometimes they‚Äôre really just that close. Interested to see this movie‚Äôs message.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-07-02,"I grew up in a strictly-religious dorm for boys for six years (middle school until high school). This happens a lot everytime someone gets close. And sometimes, they start believing they&#39;re romantically in love as well, while they simply love one another. It&#39;s crazy how the word &quot;love&quot; can become something to be ashamed of. It&#39;s a tender word. I love the word love. And me and my best friend alone experienced it as well back in middle school, but thankfully we&#39;re still friends until now that I almost graduate from college."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-12-04,"Watched this one 3 weeks ago in theaters.  It‚Äôs been years that a movie devistated me like this one did. Forgot how hard it was growing up as a kid. The acting, colors, music, ‚Ä¶ An absolute gem. When the end credits rolled, everyone just stayed seated to take a moment of the emotional impact. Still haunts me to this day to be honest."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-18,"A few weeks ago the doorbell rang and when I opened it, the young son of our next-door neighbor was  there with a male friend, shyly asking if they could retrieve their ball from our yard. They were holding hands, and I felt like crying to see their youthful innocence and simplicity. For sure they won&#39;t be holding hands much longer..."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-08,Good to see A24 distributing more foreign-language films! That&#39;s been my main critique - hopefully more to come. There&#39;s a big wide world of great films from all over the world.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-16,This is going to be very emotional. I&#39;m certain and aware of the fact that there&#39;s often stigma around male friendships. A24 guarantees the best quality films. They just never disappoint.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-18,"This looks like a lovely and heartbreaking film.  I work around children and most little boys are sweet, open and excited to express themselves but are confronted by bullies, and the demand to be tough so early.  It is very sad and the older I get I recognize it.  Because I didn&#39;t have sons I think I just wasn&#39;t always aware of the challenges they face."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-17,"the cinematography and the colors they chose look absolutely stunning, what a gorgeous trailer"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-28,"I just watched this movie. I must say it broke my heart, it tore me to pieces, and I am left in tears. It&#39;s very rare that a film can make me have a breakdown, I&#39;ve dealt with anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies since I was 7,8 or 9. I can&#39;t remember specifically the age but I remember the feeling. This film took me back to my childhood and how I evolved with my feelings and openness. This film is a masterpiece, I am grateful that stories like this are being shown and more talked about in the industry. I am hopeful about the future and how boys growing up can grow into their feelings and be honest and proud of themselves. Thank you for all who is involved with this project."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-05-03,"I saw it yesterday in a small venue. Kept sitting after the credits started rolling out. Not just because my eyes were full of tears, but I needed to collect myself. Not one silent scene was too long. In every second of those scenes we could see or feel what the character on-screen was going through or thinking. Very powerful. Great writing, acting, directing, light, photography, music... A job well done."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,These films continue to be a substitute for the meaningful conversations that I can&#39;t have with society in general.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-05,"This is probably one of my favorites films I&#39;ve seen in at least a decade. I was engaged since the first minute and I let myself lose inside the world and characters. So real, beautiful and of course emotional. I felt dehydrated by the end credits. I can&#39;t praise the filmmakers and actors enough. 10/10"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-04-09,I am so glad that i watched the film first before watching its movie trailer. It tore my heart apart. This film reminds me so much about how grief can makes us strong and vulnerable at the same time. I was wondering back then how little kids can experience grief in such a very young age. That scene where Leo bursts out crying not because he has broken arm but because he can&#39;t handle the pain about losing someone you love. AGH PERFECTION
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-03,"I saw this movie just hours ago, and I‚Äôm still crying. So intense. So real. So hurtful."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-12,"Half the comments are ‚Äúthis is going to make me sob‚Äù and the other half are ‚Äúlook at these friends being friendly and only friends, friends only, no other discussion allowed this is definitely not a commentary on the complexity of young relationships and coming of age‚Äù and it‚Äôs an interesting combo"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-11,"Very few movies made me feel and cry as much as Close did, by the talented Lukas Dohnt. Art helping us to remember those we forgot along the way, and treasure those memories. <br>Feel so close from those long gone today. Go watch it! Thank you A24."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-10-25,"I won tickets to see this movie pre-release and wow‚Ä¶ I can sincerely recommend everyone to watch it. It is beyond beautiful, a simple story with perfect cinematography. You will feel every emotion the main character is feeling when watching, it‚Äôs a true masterpiece. <br><br>(prepare a VERY large box of tissues)"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-11-30,This film is so incredibly raw. Sitting here watching it for a second time bawling my eyes out. The entire cast are so expressive in their performances with often little words said. Just incredible
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-22,"Kudos to the two young actors - Eden Dambrine and Gustav De Waele - for their exquisite, gut-wrenching performances! They each conveyed a tremendous amount of thought and emotion, often without saying a word. I watched a blissful, carefree bond get tainted and dissipate while hoping they are eventually reunited. No spoilers here, but see this film."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-26,When someone suddenly leave you or start treating you like suddenly you are zero to them... I know that pain üíî
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-26,"For anyone looking for the song playing in the second half, <br>Artist: The Hit House (William August Hunt)<br>Song: ‚ÄúThe Cardinal‚Äù.<br>Also, the film is absolutely incredible.<br>Everything from the acting, writing, cinematography, music, etc.<br>So refreshing to see films of importance like this are still being made."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-10-26,The most beautiful film if ever watched.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-23,Just from the trailer I can see those two boys are incredible actors. It&#39;s in the small details.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-11-08,I saw the movie yesterday at my college. Everyone cried. I&#39;ve never seen such a good child actors. This movie broke me...
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-12-30,How exactly this movie pictures childhood and how we act when we are kids is truly a masterpiece. I&#39;ve never felt so empty like I did after watching this movie.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,"A24 already has the best year they‚Äôve ever had and it‚Äôs about to get even better between this, The Whale, and much more"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-12,A good friend recommended me to watch this and a few days later we had a complicated farewell. I could then strongly relate to this story -how intense intimacy between good friends can develop and how heartbreaking it could be when everything went south. <br><br>A week later I came across this trailer on YouTube and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about our friendship and how sad and anxious I have been knowing I just lost a close friend. Still shed some tears thinking about him. This is definitely a very deep and intense film and I would recommend it to everyone. üíî
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-12,It&#39;s  giving  Barry Jenkins&#39; &quot;Moonlight&quot; vibes ...also an A24 production. Love it.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,this trailer was an out of body experience. so excited for this film
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,Tracking shots with people or animals running in fields never gets old
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-01,i just watched this movie and now i‚Äôm in so much pain. my first cry of 2023.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-20,"A24 films are like films, if you know what I mean. It&#39;s not like some mass produced blockbuster movies. There&#39;s a real message on every film they produce."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-08,"watched this movie in my local small cinema; cried my eyes out, At least 4 times. Glad to see a Belgian movie doing so good internationally."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-17,You guys aren&#39;t ready. I don&#39;t think I can even count the number of people crying around me when we were in the theatre.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2025-01-31,Despite being almost a silent movie this makes you scream your heart out...
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-28,"What a movie‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt remember that I feel soo strong emotional after watching this masterpiece‚Ä¶ I almost cry two times, amazing acting and roller coaster of emotions. Thank you"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-05-26,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EJGnU2AmV4&amp;t=77"">1:17</a> that scene was subtle and beautiful."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-21,"I think this looks incredible. I was just talking to my boyfriend about how men and boys should be able to form close friendships based in love without people automatically assuming it‚Äôs romantic or sexual love. NOTHING is wrong with sexual/romantic love between males at all, but it‚Äôs not fair to assume that all close relationships between boys must be inherently sexual because men are socialized not to be affectionate and warm."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-28,"I can&#39;t remember crying more in a film in at least the last 10 years than I have in this one.<br>Je ne me souviens pas avoir plus pleur√© dans un film que dans celui-ci au cours des dix derni√®res ann√©es.<br>M√™me trois heures apr√®s la fin du film, je pleure encore."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-16,This film is a masterpiece! It&#39;s not a film that you just &quot;watch&quot; but an experience where you feel every emotion. The cinematography is splendid.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-06-25,"Such a beautiful yet devastating film. I thought a lot about my own experiences after I watched it.<br>The scene when Leo breaks down was done so perfectly. <br>I always think, the films that make you dwell upon their messages for days after are the only ones we can truly call a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-12-23,"Just saw this movie and I can&#39;t stop crying. It affects me on so many levels. I had forgotten how difficult it was in those younger years, forgotten because society molded me into a different product. The purity and limitless emotions and feelings hit you hard. What a masterpiece, I&#39;m still crying.."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-08-17,"Just watched this on BBCIplayer, cried about 4 times, one of, if not the most heart wrenchingly sad films i&#39;ve watched, i wont say too much about the plot, but the subject matter and the subsequent fall out from it is handled with real tenderness, authenticity, feel and at times subtlety from the director. The performances of the two boys is ridiculously good, especially Leo. It&#39;s not a film to enjoy, but it asks some tough questions, particularly about the nature of fragile teenage friendships, its shot beautifully, has some emotionally charged scenes that will leave you in bits. A True heartbreaker, not sure iv&#39;e ever watched a film that has affected me like this one did."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-28,This was such a compelling film with beautiful cinematography. The storyline was heartbreaking on my levels. Saw it opening night.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-17,"I&#39;ve watched it twice, and cried 4 times. It&#39;s so gooooddd!!! What I like about this movie is, it captures accurately how when we were kids, we don&#39;t know how to express our feelings, and that sometimes results in friendship going distant for no apparent reason which I&#39;ve personally experienced it myselfüò¢"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-10,6 hours passed since i finished watching the movie but the heaviness in my heart still remains. i just cant move on it was so good. ive been crying the whole day.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-12-15,"This is a beautiful masterpiece. 24 hours later and I am still thinking of this movie and probably will for a long time. One of my favorite movies I‚Äôve seen this year. Possibly in my top 5 definitely in my top 10 of all time. The beautiful acting of the young characters speaking without words, the beautiful cinematography with colors that were visually appealing, and the music behind it all. Just stunning! The story shows an agape love that has grown between two boys with such platonic intimacy it‚Äôs beautiful. However, when they enter school that love is considered gay to the other school kids. It shows us that our continuing social norms is being passed down and placed on other children especially on young boys/men as to considered deep platonic intimacy as anything other than that."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-10-17,how on EARTH did they find two child actors to perform such complex and nuanced roles üò≠
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-12-08,It&#39;s been a week but So glad to see I&#39;m not the only one who has been devastated and heartbroken after watching this gem. Truly masterpiece. Can&#39;t forget the last shot of Leo when turns and looks back.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-11,the kind of feeling that someone rejecting you and push you away is really hurt so bad what more if that person who did that is your close friend for so long.. i did not expect the story of this base on the trailer.. i have a different perspective about this movie.. and after watching the full story it brakes my heart.. after so many movies ive seen this is the movie that made me cry again... if ive watch this movies in my school days or teen years it definitely affect my life coz im so close with my bestie and im so emotional whenever he left me and be with other people...üò•
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,So excited for this film!!!!! Looks beautiful and almost ethereal
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-12-17,I just seen this today. Heartbreakingly beautiful film. I can feel every ounce of pain &amp; guilt from L√©o without any word spoken. To all the R√©mis out there You have PURPOSE and <br>this world need you.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-04-04,"This reminds me so much when I was a child, falling in love with another boy, biking home with him everyday then to fall out, coping with internal wars and outside struggle. i dont care if it&#39;s sad. A gay coming of age movie has been in my head for decades now and I want it to be meaningful and beautiful. I got have no doubt that this one will do it."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-18,The movie is a masterpiece. Just about flawless. And Eden Drambrine is a young actor with a big future.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-06-10,Those two boys did an amazing job ‚ù§
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-25,I liked how this move shined light on a very real and serious problem.<br>I think it&#39;s really important that we teach kids how to communicate their emotions.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-12-25,"I watched this movie in a movie theater in Baghdad. I was very moved and cried a lot. I noticed everyone standing at the end of the movie, their eyes red."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-28,"The subject matter of this movie is personal for me, because I see myself and my first best friend in these characters, as Im sure many men will. We were, forgive me, close, from 1st Grade until 9th Grade. That was when sexuality began to pervade life due to the collective puberty we were all experiencing. One day, another kid asked us if we were gay, and everything spiraled downward from there. We gradually became distant and unresponsive with each other, and our beautiful connection, one that rendered us non-blood brothers, died. One of the great banes of society is the complete and utter emotional suppression and castration of boys becoming men."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-06,You never get another friendship like your first. I met my oldest besty at a mutual friend‚Äôs 60th. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other for 47 years but it was like just yesterday. His wife was in tears seeing us chatting and laughing at the same old stuff. Keep in touch. I urge you all. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-11-22,This movie broke me. Absolutely devastating but mesmerising film.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,Y‚Äôall rolling out movies left and right! This looks like it‚Äôs going to be a teary film
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-16,"I was so happy to see that it&#39;s gonna be a foreign language. I feel like American movies lack a certain...emotional quality because languages such as German/French have phrases that describe feelings that we do not. I&#39;ll never forget seeing my first Austrian film and I thought about it for months. It&#39;s nuts how many people skip movies because they don&#39;t wanna read the subtitles. I have a friend whose dyslexic and I used to read the subtitles to her in Asian movies because she liked them, but wasn&#39;t good at reading quickly. I loved how animated I used to get. I miss those days. You don&#39;t know the film experiences you&#39;re missing out on, just because of the language barrier. üñ§ as per usual, A24 is going to absolutely CRUSH this"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-12,I saw it last night and it is so beautifully filmed and so excellently acted and it is absolutely heart wrenching. I was not prepared for the intensity. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-07,"<b>*spoiler alert*</b> <br><br>I was truly not prepared for how much this film was going to be about grief. Holy crap! What an absolute punch in the stomach. Some of these scenes, and one in particular around the middle of the film, you really feel like it happened to you. It&#39;s really something. <br><br>Extremely relatable, too, as a gay man who, as a boy, grew up with bullying and grew up with complicated friendships with other boys. This film will be super intense and emotional for some people and just &quot;good&quot; to others."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-01-31,"I had a friend when I was in middle school, and all of a sudden, a new classmate came in and he started being distant from me. We were so close but also when he changed, you don&#39;t have to be gay or interested like that to fill this movie. We won&#39;t. We were both straight but I felt like this is the same case, but in a different engineerial. It hurt me very much to see him like pushing me away or not wanting to be my friend anymore. Just because he had made a new friend and he preferred to be with the other the other.  Boy, it was very painful to say the least. And that&#39;s why I did get this movie and it&#39;s there, right, it doesn&#39;t have to be anything about being gay. It&#39;s just a friendship, and when I guess somebody doesn&#39;t want to be your friend anymore and it pushes your way. I guess I said child you don&#39;t know how to deal with this"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-16,This trailer needs more views. It&#39;s so good and I want to watch the film.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-20,I&#39;m going to watch this tomorrow so I will have a new reason to cry to. I love sad movies it eases my pain
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-26,"Never in my life did I cry so much on one movie.. literally like a quarter of the way in till the very end üíî Even after it, I watched the cast getting a standing ovation at the movie premier and cried some more.. damn this was a heartbreaking film..."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-08-01,I watched this movie yesterday. I heard about this movie since it was nominated for the Oscars last time for the best international movie. I have no word to say but in summary I feel that this is an extremely heart touching movie. This was just reminded my childhood experiences too.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-12-10,The ending of this movie is so heartbreaking.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-26,just saw this movie and i couldn&#39;t stop crying. this movie is too beautiful and emotional and devastating!!!
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-03-05,"Can&#39;t wait for this. I&#39;m a grown male adult and I&#39;ve often worked with younger boys. It&#39;s fascinating to see how boys go from soppy loving caring creatures to harsh distant angry creatures during teenage years/adolescence/manhood. Not all boys are like this, but from working at a summer camp and a school in the past I&#39;ve seen this first hand. When boys are younger they are definitely more emotionally varied and open. When testosterone kicks in they change in many ways. Not to mention all the physical changes, but mental changes occur. <br>Another film that springs to mind is STAND BY ME. That&#39;s a good movie about boyhood challenges and friendships."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-05-31,"I have been putting this movie on my watchlist since months ago, I couldn&#39;t really recall. I had a very different idea on how the movie was going to be about a while ago, not like the general thoughts everyone else had tho. Finally I watched it on the 31st of May this year, it was very heart wrenching. All I could say is, I&#39;ve been in this situation really closely and it definitely hurt me very terribly, actually it just happened recently but the difference is, we are on our last teen. Quite old, people started to notice how close we were, but on my side, I never really mind, just like Remi did. It was quite the opposite for my other friend, he chose the same path Leo took. Long story short, it happened last month, but the pain is still there after all these time. I never really had my closure, but I hope that I could get it, or maybe it&#39;ll never be. Who knows? Luckily enough, I didn&#39;t choose to walk the same path Remi took, although I almost did. Really loved this film!"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-06-06,"This puts me in the mindframe of &quot;Moonlight&quot;. The concept, cinematography and everything. ‚ù§"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-08-17,"Crying and im only 30 minutes in. As a 16 year old girl, i find it so so so heatbreakingly sad that genuine male freinships like this cant happen because society inmediately labels close male relationships as&quot; gay &quot;. I really hope that can change one day"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-08-03,I work with elementary aged children and its the saddest thing to see the softness in friendships between boys dissappear withing a few years. This is such an important topic and im glad this film has done so well.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-07-17,"This was heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking in such a human and genuine way. I feel for everyone who has ever lost someone they&#39;d loved so much who lives with the ghost of that person everyday. Sometimes I have to detach from my empathy because I don&#39;t know where to put my feelings, I kind of had to do this after I watched this. I had to remind myself it was just a movie. The last scene with him alone in the flower field really hurt. It&#39;s honestly so rare to meet someone you connect with so deeply even at that young age, you live forever with the memory."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-04-10,"Nothing sexual about it, (albeit it may help a lot of folks experiencing those trials and tribulations in their own lives!)   For me it so perfectly captured that innocence of best friend ship as a child, wrestling around as all young men (and I presume girls) do as we are test our strengths and boundaries establishing and setting  the hierarchy of out tribes (our own Little Rascals) as we are still figuring out who we are and were we fit in the world!  From endless joking, challenging each other, seeking the approval of the other, yet always having each others back!  Probably one of the finest pieces of direction and empathy and emotion (through production values) that I have ever experienced!   Notice That I did not say &quot;ever seen!&quot;  because one does not &quot;watch&quot; this film... Your heart actually speeds up as the kids running or riding through the Tulip fields with the camera racing right along with them in a car or dolly was just remarkable! And, we all remember that first time time in our own lives when our best friend and split and went the other direction, the feeling of betrayal and anger and hurt and confusion from losing that first most trusted best friend felt, even if life has protected us from remembering &quot;that feeling all of these years&quot; this extraordinary director struck that chord perfectly!   -JUST WOWWWW!"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2024-08-05,"such a great movie. I really appreciate this is shown on American TV. Like a breath of fresh air. No shooting, not much loud dialogues, just beautiful tranquil emotional and very powerful story. The cinematography beautifully compliments the narrative.‚ù§"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-19,I just finished watching this movie... and I&#39;m still crying. ü•∫ This Is extremely beautifully made piece of something. I loved every single shot. Thanks for bringing it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.üòá
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-18,The trailer was one minute and 40 seconds long why am I already crying
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-27,"This film is absolutely the saddest film in this decade after &quot;Hatchi a dog tale&quot; I have never felt this sort of anger or sadness over a movie (because I&#39;m used to get affected by them like series) it was too much that I wasn&#39;t able to finish it when I got to the middle of it üíî The movie talks about two kids who are so in love with each other, so pure, so lovely that you&#39;d wish that you had such a friendship in your younger. The two starts to get separated after they get to middle school, and the way the story went was üíî I just have no words till now to describe how sad it becomes and how agony it made me feel when it happened üíî <br>The movie &quot;Close&quot; is a children story, but not for children to watch _believe me in that. So, what hurts the most about it is how it makes you wish that it is only a dream and the main character is going to wake up eventually and the story would be WOW still, moreover, it makes you feel lost and witness the regret in a hard way. Okay I can talk no more about this film, for it hurts badly. üíî"
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-01-28,Reminds me of being a boy and having a &quot;best friend.&quot; It was the 70&#39;s so of course there weren&#39;t any parents around. We just walked or rode our bikes over to our friend&#39;s house and played and hung out. Home for dinner.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-02-11,"Beautiful film, and so sensitive. Very sad but not at all overwrought or melodramatic, it&#39;s very understated."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-05-08,"I already watch the movie yesterday and it broke my heart üò≠ I still remember when I was a child I have a bestfriend too that.

Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-10-07,"Reminds me of a movie I watched awhile back called ‚ÄúHeartstone‚Äù I think. I can‚Äôt wait for this, it looks beautiful yet haunting."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-12-10,This is film is personal. You can already feel how intimate and authentic it is from this trailer ‚ù§‚Äçüî•Major &quot;it&quot; factor
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-16,"If it&#39;s anywhere near as good as Dhont&#39;s previous film Girl, then it&#39;s going to be remarkable. I CAN&#39;T WAIT."
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2023-04-26,"FINALLY saw this film and all I can say is WOW. So touching and heartbreaking. Definitely a tearjerker. Excellent film about pain, love, and friendship."

Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-11-27,It&#39;s been a long time since I didn&#39;t cry so much watching a film.
Close,6EJGnU2AmV4,2022-09-07,A24 still on fire I see. Seems they understand the true depths of art and how to make us truly feel something
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,I remember this popular guy in my English class in high school saying he hated reading Wuthering Heights because it was just some dumb romance for girls and I&#39;ll never forget the (male) teacher going on this whole spiel about Bronte&#39;s genius and that this kid had completely missed one of the best revenge stories ever written because he was too busy being sexist to bother paying attention. It was the first time I saw a man openly and unapologetically defend a woman&#39;s art. I&#39;m in my forties now and I still remember that. He was one of the coolest teachers I ever had.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,Emma Mackey must be one of the most talented actress of her generation. I can&#39;t wait to watch her as Emily
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,the way emma mackey knows how to portray every character she plays perfectly. she just gets into the atmosphere and tries her best to perform and she manages to do that. one of the reasons she is one of my favourite actresses.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"I can&#39;t wait to see all the Bront√´ sisters on screen, especially Emily. All three sisters were incredible novelists, and it&#39;s such a shame that society at the time condemned women writing stories, instead expecting them to be housewives and mothers. Like many female writers at the time, they had their works published under male names so they wouldn&#39;t have scandal and controversy at their doorstep. It&#39;s very tragic that all three sisters died young; I felt that Emily&#39;s death was the worst of all. I wish they lived long enough to see their works become literary masterpieces."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"i actually and genuinly believe that Emma Mackey is perfect for this role, rare are the times where i feel such strong connexion with the way a character (especially a historical figure!) is portrayed in movies, i&#39;m so excited to watch this"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,I deeply hope this is good and worthy of Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights is one of the most gripping books I have ever read.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,Every loner and introvert when reading about Emily cannot help but say &quot; I understand exactly why she thought/ did that&quot; what a total one off she was.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Actually very sad to know that all these great creators had such a difficult life, because of their unique thoughts. And only after they have passed away, are appreciated and known as legends"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"The score went absolutely PERFECT with the cinematography in this trailer. Acting looks sublime, the way she can fit perfectly into ANY role she plays is just phenomenal. Stunning video editing and casting direction. The overhead shots look amazing and vivid."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,&quot;Everyone&#39;s strange if you look at them long enough!&quot;<br>Couldn&#39;t have been said better. This sentence just hits different.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,The scene of them shouting &#39;freedom in thought&#39; really reminds me of that Anne with an E scene with Anne and Cole standing at the edge of a cliff shouting &#39;come to me muse!&#39; Or that one scene from The Book Thief where Liesel and Rudy are standing at a lake in the middle of the woods shouting &#39;I hate Hitler!&#39;<br>These scenes are gold! üòç And this looks so thrilling and amazing! üß°
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,My son was on this shoot..Emma was amazing with the kids!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"The feeling of being a Misfit is definitely  a creative journey , Im glad she never gave up otherwise we wouldn&#39;t of had her amazing stories"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,&quot;Everyone&#39;s strange if you look at them long enough&quot; must be my fav lines out of the entire trailer.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"I hate this already. Emily Bront√´ was a genius partly because she had literally no real life experience to inspire even one word of Wuthering Heights - it was pure intellect and imagination. And if we go down that route of shaping WH as some kind of tragic romance again I‚Äôll cry. It just isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs about nature v nurture, the trauma and cycle of abuse, the tension between the natural state of childhood with its goodness and innocence but also its cruelty and selfishness and the falsity but more civilised conformity to the social norms of adulthood and I could go on and on‚Ä¶ If she had been a man we wouldn‚Äôt keep framing it as a love story. when she was thought to be a man, people didn‚Äôt. They were disturbed by it but also recognised it as a work of massive psychological insight. The more interesting story to me is not of a totally imagined passion to make this woman more understandable and relatable and that will make her spin in her grave, but how did someone so anti-social, so completely disengaged with everything and everyone outside of her home, come up with all of that‚Ä¶?"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-14,"Oh yes. Because a woman cannot be interested in art for art&#39;s sake. A woman cannot be the greatest female novelist in history and totally uninterested in romance and marriage at the same time. Oh no, there always has to be a man or a romantic attachment in the equation. Very little is known of Emily Bront√´&#39;s inner life because most of it happened inside her head and not in public. She did&#39;nt have close friends she corresponded with, like Charlotte. She left some journal entries, her poetry, her Gondal series and one of the best, most powerful novels ever written.  What we know of her, we know through the eyes of Charlotte Bront√´: &quot;Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone.&quot; I hate this fictionalization of real life artists. Genius cannot be pinned down like a butterfly."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Hmmm I don‚Äôt know about this film. It doesn‚Äôt seem very true to many of the things I‚Äôve read about Emily Bront√´. I think the relationship between the three sisters (and their father and Branwell) is fascinating enough without making it a romance (and as far as we know, Emily didn‚Äôt HAVE any romances!)"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"I always get nervous when I see biopics about authors, especially female ones. So often these kinds of movies attribute all the authors&#39; fantastic ideas to some guy that did them wrong or some boy who died tragically, etc. rather than just acknowledging that a woman can write for the sake of their love of writing and their own imagination. Hope this one does the Brontes justice!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-14,Finally a period piece that seems to have costumes and art direction that feels appropriate and not too modernized for today&#39;s audiences.  And the trailer peaks my curiosity.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-03-13,"A very intense book and such an amazing exploit for a young woman who experienced not much in her life, but who could write with a tremendous depth. A timeless novel."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Look, I love Emma Mackey, but we already have the perfect Bronte Sisters biopic with Sally Wainwright&#39;s &#39;To Walk Invisible&#39;, and Chloe Pirrie&#39;s performance as Emily in that is just incredible."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-10-17,"Just watched this movie. Beautifully acted but be aware it is ‚Äúloosely based on Emily‚Äôs life‚Äù so avoid if you‚Äôre going to say this, that or the other part of her story is incorrect. It‚Äôs a tale of literature, love and revenge, well acted and and very enjoyable."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-30,"As an English Literature student, I had goosebumps. A BBC Classics vibe. Emma Mackey is the actress of the next-gen. Keep it up!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"So I&#39;m under the impression that Emily Bronte was an introverted homebody that had a lot of social anxiety but loved her family, kinda like Beth in Little Women, even died young too, I really wonder how this movie os gonna portray this literary figure"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,Why do I get the feeling from this that they&#39;re making her out to be a genius and a free spirit by putting down her brilliant sisters? Why do they think there can there only be one &quot;special one&quot;?
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"It looks good, the acting is good but I hate it and Emily would have hated it even more. She hated people sticking her nose into her life and she would hate it even more than instead of showing her closest connection: WITH ANNE, they are focusing on totally made-up romance and kisses that never happened. It is like you cannot make a movie about a strong and talented writer who is female and had no romantic life and apparently zero interest in it."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"i love emma mackey, she&#39;s the perfect choice to play emily"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,Can&#39;t wait to see her portray this character. Looks enchanting!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-16,"For anyone interested in this, and who hasn‚Äôt seen To Walk Invisible, I recommend that as a good starting point. Great film about the Bront√´, came out a few years ago. Feels super real. Moving. Powerful. It‚Äôs on Prime."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"Looks great! I really enjoyed the BBC series &quot;TO WALK INVISIBLE&quot; a few years ago. It chronicles the entire Bronte family and shows the struggles of motivations of each without conjecturing too far into the realm of fiction. Still, this one looks great! It would be nice to see a different film (with the same cast) for each of the three Bronte sisters."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,Such an amazing cast! Can‚Äôt wait to see Anne Bront√´ on screen üß°
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-11-18,"I love this film, I watched it twice. Cried both times, there is something so relatable to me about how Emily is portrayed in this film. Yes I understand it‚Äôs not based on facts, it‚Äôs embellished a little, but that‚Äôs ok with me. It‚Äôs interesting to think of these what if‚Äôs sometimes. I relate to how she‚Äôs the black sheep in the family, the artist in her, the great love that changed in a blink. It‚Äôs just perfection to me."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"Beautiful üòç Emma Mackey is so talented, and nailed the role of Jacky, in Death of the Nile. Can‚Äôt wait to see this."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"<b>Emily imagines the transformative, exhilarating, and uplifting journey to womanhood of a rebel and a misfit, one of the world&#39;s most famous, enigmatic, and provocative writers who died too soon at the age of 30!!</b>"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"As a literary student, this types of movies does pinch a vein, hope it will be good. And love Emma Mackey."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-15,"misfit, unconventional, can‚Äôt describe how emma seems perfect for this role. it‚Äôs all in her face, in the way she moves her eyes. can‚Äôt wait to watch this !!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,My favourite author portrayed by one of my favourite actors! Absolutely brilliant!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"I&#39;m interested in watching this movie because the trailer already shows how people have always misunderstood Wuthering Heights in various ways.  People expect something from the book, but either freak out or are delighted when it pulls the rug out from under them.  Emily, you&#39;re still amazing after all these years, and I&#39;m so glad you allowed this book to be published!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-15,I‚Äôm glad Emma is getting more roles. This looks great.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-12-04,I&#39;m so happy for Emma that she got this role. Just watched it and it was excactly what I hoped it would be. I didn&#39;t cry but got close. Emma and Oliver are amazing.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2024-02-17,This film was so good! Emma&#39;s acting was top notch. Hope she gets more and more roles!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-14,"Unpopular opinion I know but I don‚Äôt like the look of this! Having read actual biographies about Emily Bronte and the Bronte family as well as studying the novels this for me is not Emily Bronte. Why do people think that she must have had some form of love life to be able to write Wuthering Heights not that she was a literary genius who had a beautiful way with words. She was a strong women with ideas ahead of her time with a powerful and beautiful imagination. She loved her family and Haworth. Yes she did know William but it‚Äôs Anne that we think liked him, especially if you read Agnes Grey! Sorry but this is not Bronte 4 me. Also why is her hair in that style?"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-07-26,"While I think that the film is trying to portray her as a misfit, and it really was true, she was a bit different- I think it also highlighted that even if you‚Äôre a bit ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù (whatever that may be) or a genius- you still experience very human emotions. What I got from this is that human emotions are universal, no matter where, when or your circumstances. It was such a beautiful film"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Emily &amp; Anne Bronte‚Äôs works are astonishing - you wonder how much imagination they had, to create what they did (Anne was a bit more isolated than her sisters, who went to school &amp; spent time as governesses- so in some ways, that adds to the mystery...)"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Meanwhile, I&#39;m sitting here waiting for my girl Anne Bronte to get some recognition and respect"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"WOW, cannot wait to see it! Wuthering Heights is a genious novel!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"Emma Mackey is everywhere, and I&#39;m loving it!!!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-09-12,"If only Emily Bronte had lived longer, what she could have written. Wuthering Heights is a true masterpiece."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,I&#39;m really excited to see this. I think the casting of Emma as Emily is brilliant
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-11-04,This movie is a worthy homage for one of the world&#39;s greatest novels. Highly recommended. 10/10
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-15,I&#39;m so glad that they finally made a movie about my favourite writer Emily Bronte.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"There were 2 older sisters, Elizabeth,  and Maria,  both died in childhood,  Elizabeth  would  read the daily paper  to her father at the age of  4 , the whole family,  were touched with genus  , thank god , even if they had to publish  under  a male name ,they did ,and in my view  Emily gave the world a,MASTERPIECE  THANK  YOU EMILY üòä üôè üíô"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"Moody trailer. Hope they do justice to portraying the close relationship between the sisters, and treat with empathy the storyline involving Branwell. Really hope that the romantic subplot doesn&#39;t derail the film but is tastefully imagined...<br><br>The Brontes, and their life stories, are each so fascinating. Their works, treasures. Please let this be a good film..."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-11-17,Just watched this and oh man this movie was something. Emma Mackey is absolutely perfect in this film and her acting is superb. I didn&#39;t see any trailers for this and just went in completely blind and I&#39;m glad I did. This was such a nice surprise and more people need to see this movie.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-02-19,I was fortunate to have been introduced to many of the great writers and poets in high school by my English teacher Mrs Lynch. Emily Bronte was and still is my favorite! Loved the classic film of her novel Wuthering Heights starting the late Sir Laurence Olivier
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-11-16,I just finished this movie.. and OH MY GOD! One of the most beautiful movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,Looks like there is now a real life Heathcliff and a real life Linton...do we just not trust Emily to be able to create these characters from her IMAGINATION without needing real-life counterparts??
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"This looks like the filmmakers have forced Emily Bront√´ into the Becoming Jane movie mould. I‚Äôve never heard of Emily having any romantic relationships. That‚Äôs not to say it never happened, but if this is saying she only could have written such a brilliant love story based off her own relationships, ugggh."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-05-27,"this was a magically painful  movie to see. stunning music. I walked in not knowing what I was seeing, as a writer, I was CAPTIVATED. go see this if you want to FEEL something"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,so excited to see fionn whitehead on screen again ü§©
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-16,"Magical. Emily, like Jane Austen never wed, dying of tuberculosis too soon. Both her sisters wrote of course but Wuthering Heights firmly planted her family flag in English Literature."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-12-07,"I read a book many years ago, I cannot remember the title, but I do remember the page number. It was 26. it was a sequel to Withering heights. it explained that when Heathcliffe found her in a grave, he tried to dig her out because her hand raised up from the soil."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2024-02-24,"Fancy! I&#39;m a fan of Charlotte Bront√´&#39;s book Jane Eyre, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever read Emily&#39;s Wuthering Heights yet. I should read that and then watch this!!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"I don‚Äôt like the look of this.. it looks like they‚Äôre dragging down 2 women to push a third up on a pedestal and I am SO sick of Hollywood doing this to create a ‚Äústrong female character.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to drag other women down to shine. And quite frankly, all 3 Bront√´ sisters were exceptional  writers and women, as shown in the (considerably more historically accurate, judging from this trailer) TV movie To Walk Invisible. <br>If we HAVE to have a film about a single Bront√´ sister, I‚Äôd rather have one about Anne, since she‚Äôs often the forgotten sister. But I don‚Äôt see why, since all 3 sisters would be in any film anyway, there‚Äôs a need for a film about a single sister.. let all 3 Bront√´s shine!"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-10-12,Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest books ever written.   Hope the film does justice to Emily Bronte and her sisters!!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-18,"It feels really bizarre to portray someone who has two incredible authors as her sisters as this misunderstood literary rebel. Like, all three sisters wrote classic novels. It is not like Emily was completely alone."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-15,Emma Mackey has range. I hope her career will take off like she deserves. I also would like to see this movie.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"I love Emily Bront√´ and Wuthering Heights since I was 12!!! In a world fawning over Austen and light-hearted romance books, it&#39;s so hard to get some spotlight for us sad, passionate girls üò≠üñ§ So thank you so much for giving us Bront√´ fans this gift, Warner Bros.!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2024-05-17,"The first time I watched about half, the second time, all of it. Now, on the 15th occasion, I can&#39;t get enough. Looking into family is extremely interesting, more so than the movie. Such an extremely talented family with a goomly ending, more than  the move.<br><br>Watched it more than once, but it could have been better with a little bit more of something,  I don&#39;t know."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,Literally cannot wait for this! It looks amazing and really excited to see Amelia Gething in her first big screen role!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"Finally another film of this era with the correct hairstyles, dresses and finally bonnets, watch and learn little women and your lack of historical accuracies"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,I enjoy that everyone is wearing a bonnet.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-14,Whoa.<br>The visuals. They really take you back there.<br>Most impressive.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,"&quot;Everyone is strange, if you look at them for long enough&quot; What a line."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-14,omg i read wuthering heights and i can&#39;t believe they made a film for the author!!!<br>i wish i could watch it in Indonesia Cinemas
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,NGL I thought this was gonna be another Emily Dickinson adaptation so when I saw it was instead Emma Mackey playing Emily Bronte I was over the moon!!! Fionn Whitehead is also the best... loved him since Dunkirk!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-10-11,As a Yorkshire person I just wanna say their glottal stops are perfect. üòÜ A bad Yorkshire accent is a bug bear of mine.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,I love such movies. They are such a breath of fresh air from the comic book nonsense Hollywood has been filled with.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-09-23,This is something new.. first time i see a movie that will focus on the life of the bronte sisters. I&#39;ll totally watch it
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,My favourite person ever ‚ù§Ô∏è nobody was or is as clever as Emily . Wuthering heights is one of the best books ever written in terms of technique and emotion.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-01-24,I am beyond excited to see this trailer. Wuthering Heights was my favorite book as a young adult. I am so pleased that Frances O‚ÄôConnor directed. I‚Äôm marking my calendar right now!!! <br>It looks wonderful!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-11-27,Give her an Oscar already. She is everywhere.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-10-07,Who knew the Bronte sisters were all such stunning beauties. Thanks for opening my eyes Hollywood.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"i wish they&#39;d have made the film more about all 3 bronte sisters ( their friendship, rivalry etc)"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-10-19,"It was just perfect to me. The way they hide scenes from the novel as an inspiration for her in life was genius. The actors had great chemistry, illustrating when two different worlds attracted to each other even against their characters. Depths, passion and a perfect transition of feelings thanks to the cinematography"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,I&#39;m pretty sure they all knew they could write. Since they had been doing it since they were children. The Brontes&#39; juvenilia is well known.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2023-10-10,My friend gave me the most beautiful copy of Wuthering heights. I was so happy to have it for English in college.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,This looks incredible! Also keen to see how Charlotte Bront√´ is portrayed.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-10-25,Just been to the cinema...x Loved it...x I went in without even seeing the trailer...not even had a read of the book yet...it scares me...Will do now..x
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-12,&quot;Everyone is strange if you look at them long enough.&quot;<br>Nice line.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-21,I&#39;m so glad Emma Mackey is doing well!! Can&#39;t wait to see it
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-11,"I love Emma Mackey sooo much, I will watch this movie for sure"
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2024-03-31,"I really struggled with Wuthering Heights in high school. While my fellow classmates sighed and swooned over the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy‚Ä¶I just found it creepy and toxic. It was well written but I just found it off putting. Seriously, the scene in the graveyard had girls saying ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve loved it if my boyfriend had done the same.‚Äù<br><br>Then I had to read it again in college. And when our professor asked us our thoughts in class, I finally spoke out and said what I thought. I was expecting the professor to admonish me. To my surprise, she asked me ‚ÄúHow would you feel if I told you it wasn‚Äôt intended to be a romance novel at all?‚Äù She then proceeded to tell the whole class that the whole romanticization happened when it was first made in a film in the 1930‚Äôs.<br><br>I felt so validated."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-16,The sisters all wrote together and all supported one another&#39;s stories. Why are they trying to portray Emily as the black sheep of the family? I hate that they&#39;ve fictionalised such an incredible woman just to tell another fictional story of another ahead-of-her-time rebel in a love triangle.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-09-01,Good thing they&#39;re making a movie on her. Wuthering Heights is one my favorite books.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-20,"I love Wuthering Heights so much and if anyone deserves a biopic it&#39;s Emily Bront√´. I don&#39;t know much about Emily but I hope it&#39;s going to be as accurate as possible. I did read a lot of it is based in rumors too like the affair, which I&#39;m not sure if I like...but I think Emma will do a great job portraying her based on just what I&#39;ve heard about Emily and her personality. The trailer looks so good!<br>I hope they play Kate Bush&#39;s song Wuthering Heights at the end, it&#39;s my favorite of all time and it would be such a missed opportunity not to play it."
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-09-02,Ms Bronte was an imaginative and disciplined literary genius despite her austere surroundings.
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-30,This trailer is so awesome<br>I listen to it like music
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-17,so happy to see Emma Mackey do a different role..love her!!
Emily,xaL90sMAzbY,2022-08-13,"Not sure about this, seems like from this short trailer that they are making Emily into someone she wasn&#39;t..and putting down her sisters when all 3 were incredibly talented."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-26,"Wow!! They actually got a Japanese actor to play a Japanese character in a Hollywood movie??!! That hasn&#39;t happen before!! Hopefully there will be more true to characters representations in Hollywood movies in the Future!! This looks so dope I can&#39;t wait to see it.. The Japanese actor is slaying it, I think I saw him in Rorounin Kenshin live action.."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-26,"As a long time Saint Seiya fan, I just hope they don&#39;t change the plot.  The story itself is a masterpiece already, no need to make up anything new"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,Just hope they make it like Rurouni Kenshin was made... that was a masterpiece. Be faithful to the lore and it&#39;s golden.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-09-06,Zoro looking good here
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-24,This actually looks better than expected
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-28,So so happy Mackenyu is gaining recognition! He deserves it allüíï
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-28,Mackenyu is such a great actor! So happy to see him lead this project! This is gonna be a good one!
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-07-08,"Thank you for the making of this Movie., the action and the actors did a Amazing job!! Thank you for caring for this fan base all of you that made this happen!!üòäüòä"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS MOVIE BEING MADE?????? I was a huge fan of the anime as a kid. I‚Äôm so hyped for this!
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-04-17,saw &quot;among us&quot; in the theater and busted out laughing with my friends
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-31,"As somebody who barely remembers the Original anime yet still holds a special place for me, I&#39;m actually excited to see it. I really do hope they can pull this off."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-20,Good news for all who has grown up with this great series since childhood. We are now lucky to remember those wonderfull years in front of the TV afternoon after school.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-04-30,They really wiped their asses with the original plot and characters uh
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-27,I&#39;m not completely sold on the armor (which is a missed opportunity because the potential to translate the look into live action was *huge*) but honestly this looks really great otherwise! I&#39;m super excited to see it. Can&#39;t wait!
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-30,So much creativity in these fan-made YouTube videos. They even had enough YT money to cast Boromir!
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-30,"From what I&#39;ve read about the plot of the movie, Seiya is supposed to be searching for his missing sister which is pretty accurate with the original story. In the classic anime, Mitsumasa Kido tells him to go to Greece and come back with the Pegasus cloth in order for him to find his sister. Looks like this movie might lead up to the battle at Sanctuary. If they do a good enough job, the second movie could be the Poseidon saga and the third movie could be the Hades saga. But that&#39;s being extremely hopeful that they get this first movie right.<br><br>Edit: According to the most recent article I came across about this movie, it&#39;s supposed to be the 1st of 6 movies. But they&#39;ll be based on the Netflix adaptation of Saint Seiya. Soooo we&#39;ll have to wait until the movie comes out to see what direction they plan on going in. Also, Kurumada says he enjoyed the movie and thinks the fans worldwide will also enjoy it."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-24,"Nice Seiya looks very cool, Athena seems pretty and Sean Bean makes it even more dramatic! Great action as well! Knights of the Zodiac!"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-28,"Oooh, Arata Mackenyu as Pegasus Seiya!! The trailor seems great and the cast is just blowing. Cant&#39;t wait!"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-09-01,Zoro got so lost he traveled to a different anime.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,&quot;Je pr√©f√®re qu&#39;on reste amis en toute amiti√©&quot; Ma devise pour ce film.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-08,So now Saint Seiya got the Dragon Ball Evolution treatment.   <b>throws up</b>
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-29,"Love Mackenyu and love Sean Bean. Never would have expected to see them acting together, but now I absolutely have to see this. ü§©"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2025-01-28,"As a core fan of Saint Seiya the manga and each story of the anime while growing up,, after watching this movie, all I can say is this: I can forgive many things, but I will never forgive you for what you did, Sony, for turning The Phoenix into something pathetic and unrecognizable. Ikki is the Phoenix, and the Phoenix doesn&#39;t need to &quot;steal&quot; Cosmo from anything. It‚Äôs the Phoenix, for crying out loud!<br>And the plot? Are you kidding me? The original story is perfect the way it is. It doesn‚Äôt need your unnecessary changes or cheap twists to &quot;fit&quot; whatever bizarre idea you had. The manga is a masterpiece, and even the anime honors its spirit. This movie? It&#39;s nothing but a hollow imitation.<br>I feel sorry for Mackenyu, but this movie didn‚Äôt just disappoint me; it made me angry. You‚Äôve taken something beautiful and turned it into something that doesn‚Äôt even deserve the name."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-29,"Omg, Mckenyu, congratulations, finally a movie with you as the lead role. I am so happy for you, I will definitely watch it to support you ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,"I really hope the full film is as good as the trailer. I was a fan of the original anime Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac as soon as I was able to see it here in the US (yes, I know it was a Japanese manga first). I can&#39;t expect it to be exactly like the series, but I hope they pay decent homage to it."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-30,Mackenyu is in Rurouni kenshin if u wanna see how badass he actually is ‚ù§
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-26,"I just hope the story is as good as the fight scenes. Because if that happenes, then hope for having great anime adaptations could be restored."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-09-08,came here cuz of his presence in One Piece ü§≠

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,"When i was a senior high school pupil, i watched Saint Seiya Anime Series on TV...üëèüëèüòçüòçnow, there&#39;s the live action version, can&#39;t wait to watch it...üëçüëçüòçüòç Saori is beautiful... and all the Knights of the Zodiacs are charming... üëèüëèüíñüíñ‚ú®‚ú®"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,If you compare this to the first trailer they released you can tell they made a few improvements and I&#39;m glad they did. This looks fantastic already!

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-04-03,"I&#39;ll admit, this actually looks REALLY good, and due to the fact that Athena&#39;s guardians are from all over the globe, Saint Seiya is a good choice for this type of treatment."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,37 years and i&#39;v been waiting for this moment ..only hoping this leads to more versions of  saint seiya live actions movies
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,"Although I am not too familiar with Saint Seiya..I have seen how the action scenes and previs work for this movie at comic con and lets just say..Andy Cheng is an incredible action director (part of the jackie chan stunt team) and they definitely have the visual aesthetics down for how anime fight scenes work..Also the director himself started out as animator that made shortfilms who worked on The Witcher games cgi scenes as well as executively producing The Witcher series...definitely has a knack for adapations..hopefully it translates well for his first feature length movie....So Im hoping this movie has everything fans and newcomers can enjoy..and hey, if it gets people interested in watching more Saint Seiya...thats a win for me"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-06-27,Just seen it. Was I satisfied? Totally!

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-29,My favorite part was Jean Grey saying no one will be able to stop him after he learns to control his powers. Sounds familiar.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-24,"ire a verla naturalmente para apoyar a la franquicia, trato de ir con expectativas bajas para no decepcionarme, pero es que es Saint Seiya me entra el Hype!!! y luego el concierto anunciado en CDMX para Septiembre pues que les digo, amo la franquicia asi que ire a aportar lo mio"

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-07-04,"It&#39;s really enjoyable. Not sure why some people are hating so hard. <br>I will say you should have a big glass of wine or few beers with it because we tend to have really short attention spans due to Tiktok, etc. A drink just chills out those tendencies so you can just chill and enjoy the movie. Trust me... you&#39;ll really enjoy it then. üòâ"

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-06-28,Does Sean Bean survive to the credits?  Does this trope narrate the plot?  Does the delivery or development cover it&#39;s weakness with CGI?  Does this movie have an agenda?
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-06-30,Did anyone else notice that one of the actress in This Is The Girl Who Played Jean Grey in the 2000s Xmen films
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-07-27,"jesus, this is dbz evolution for saint seiya"

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-27,This is a classic. So many iterations had been made. My favorite is andromeda and they better cast the most beautiful guy for that.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,"Seriously.. is this about only Seiya? The essence of the manga and anime was the friendship, honor and the loyalty of all the Athena‚Äôs Knights surrounded Seiya. All of them came from hardest moments in their childhood and how they become worthy on wearing the myth cloths of Athena."
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-03-25,"They stayed true to the power, suits, and speed of the knights as well as the brutality of the hand to hand fight! I hope the story is as dark as the one from the manga series!"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-14,Everyone came here from that article but have decided to act surprised and pretending you didn&#39;t. üòÇ

Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-09-03,"After watching One Piece, I am allover with Mackenyu ‚ù§ I think I&#39;m gonna watch this movie because of him hahahaha"
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-05,I hate that this sounds negative.  But this looks terrible. Hollywood just loves to finger my childhood.
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2024-05-11,It&#39;s like a low-budget asian movie except when budget gets higher. I like that :)
Knights of the Zodiac,Sko0o_KoBHY,2023-05-06,I smell a DBZ movie coming in like 20 years. This look dope !!

Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,This is basically a movie about adulthood.  Everyone seems to be moving on and up while you&#39;re stuck trying to figure the hot water heater
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,This is one of those movies to watch on a Tuesday afternoon on spring day after calling in to work cause you were feeling under the weather.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Seeing Andre in a movie like this is so cool. He always talks about he doesn&#39;t feel hip enough anymore, he feels adult and this movie portrays that on the arts"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,It‚Äôs great to see Hong Chau in another A24 movie. Glad she‚Äôs getting a lot of exposure now because she‚Äôs so underrated.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"One of my favs at the last Cannes Film Festival. Saw it just after the award ceremony and it was such a nice, calm and relaxing piece of film. Yout being projected into the life of a woman in it&#39;s thirty, who live as an artist. And then Reichardt follows a thread of ironic, touching, meditating sequences about life going on on screen. By little touches, she show us all kinds of feelings, thoughts and situations. And you just happen to carry on with it... Truly magic on film"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,A24 always has the best trailers. They never spoil the film&#39;s plot<br>I&#39;ll definitely see this üé• for Andre 3000
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Michelle Williams is one of the best actress of her generation. She&#39;s a chameleon in many of her movies. She can really dissapeared into a role, as much as she&#39;s extremely invested in her character. So yeah, I&#39;m always excited to see a movie starring Michelle Williams especially when it comes to smaller indie stuff with dark tragic themes that apparently she prefers in picking roles"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-19,A girl in my class at college did dig a hole for one of our sculpture projects. It became this real battle with her and the earth. It was fantastic. Loved art college. It can express yourself in many ways. Looks like a great movie. Can wait to see it.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Michelle Williams is an absolute gem, and if you really want to see her best performance watch Manchester by the Sea, you will definitely tear up"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"‚ÄòI get up and do a little of this and a little of that, then before you know it‚Äôs time to watch tv again‚Äô ‚Ä¶ok now he‚Äôs actually living the dream üòÇ"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-17,Something about his trailer was really soothing to me. I&#39;ll definitely be checking this out...
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"When I think of actors who consistently deliver strong supporting performances, Hong Chau is one that comes to mind. <br><br>It‚Äôs also cool to see Andre 3000 back on the big screen."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-16,"Being an artist, this film seems pretty close to home and accurate.  I even recognize the art they&#39;re using at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wELPTxJ2YZY&amp;t=100"">1:40</a>.  The artist is Michelle Segre, and I hope she&#39;s credited."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"KELLY REICHARDT!!! Always so underrated! One of my fave &quot;hidden gem&quot; directors, along with Nicole Holofcener."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Kelly Reichardt is maybe the most underappreciated American director today. She‚Äôs on such a hot streak, I‚Äôve loved everything of hers since Wendy and Lucy."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"When I saw this email show up, I actually laughed because a Kelly Reichardt comedy about making art is everything I have ever wanted from A24. This looks delightful and I am so excited!"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Michelle Williams, what a talent! Hope she gets some awards sometime soon‚Ä¶"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"A movie for artists and art enthusiasts, love it!"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,Hong Chau is everywhere AND I AM HERE FOR IT!!!!
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,Love Kelly Reichhardt movies. They&#39;re all so special
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-17,I just saw Michelle Williams and Judd Hirsch in The Fabelmans. It was so good and I am expecting the same for this movie with them in the cast.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Michelle is a very talented actress and I also love A24 bring in many somewhat unknown actors for the movie, giving them the opportunity to shine."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Hong Chau taking over the cinema experience for real. The Menu, The Whale and now this üéâ"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"i was thinking about this movie being nowhere to be seen yesterday and then the trailer gets released .... so glad, it looks awesome !!!"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,This is giving me flashbacks to the single week I spent at an &#39;artist commune&#39; before I gave up and left to study graphic design instead.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"We all better be Showing Up to the theater, because this looks wonderful."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-03-25,A24 is killing it right now. I have watched about 5 trailers from them and I want to see all of them.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Kelly Reichardt and Michelle Williams are one of my favourite director actor duo in Hollywood. Wendy and Lucy, Certain Women, and Meek&#39;s Cutoff, these small indie movies that I truly love watching it and I can&#39;t wait to see their fourth collaboration in this movie. It looks as good as I expected from a Kelly Reichardt movie and I&#39;m hoping this to be the best in their collab"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-04-09,John Magaro&#39;s voice is so unique that I could make out it is him without even looking at his face. Past Lives AND this - I&#39;m excited for Magaro!!!
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-06-07,This movie is gonna bring back all the frustration I felt in art school. I can feel it.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-20,"As an installation and dance artist I‚Äôm so excited for this! I‚Äôve always been really scared about how I‚Äôm gonna make it as an artist when I get older. Interesting perspective,can‚Äôt wait!"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,Yay a Kelly Reichardt film!  Such a reliably awesome director. Love all her work ‚ù§
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"She‚Äôs the best in Synecdoche, New York, Take This Waltz, Manchester, Halloween H20, Dick and can‚Äôt wait to see her in Fablemans. She‚Äôs seriously becoming my favorite actress."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2025-03-14,Just saw this was on hbo max. One of my favorite films. Really reminds me of graduating from art school and trying to continue to make art even though it was harder for me than some of my classmates post grad.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-04-26,This looks like such a beautiful movie. I love these movies that just showcase someone‚Äôs life in a such an honest and unabashed way.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-16,A24 is consistently putting out such fantastic movies! Can&#39;t wait for this.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Michelle Williams is seriously a national treasure when it comes to acting. Literally a whole another level of acting skills, not only that she&#39;s one of the best actress of her generation but she&#39;s also one of few actress who deserves to win an Oscar atleast once in her career"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2024-03-20,"The movie depicts one of easy-going situations in someone&#39;s life along with the complexity of any obstacles deterring the determination to achieve something. Hats off to the director, screenwriters and all actors."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,love that Hong Chau is just appearing in every movie
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"Hong Chau was hilarious in The Menu, this movie looks interesting!"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-23,"menopause, the movie. man, kelly reichardt used to be one of my favorite directors. what happened to the person who made Old Joy or Wendy &amp; Lucy. Night Moves, even. loved those"
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-19,I just rewatched Wendy and Lucy the other week not knowing this was happening. So glad!!!
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,Kelly Reichardt is one of the most gifted filmmakers ever!
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,I can&#39;t believe Judd Hirsh is still alive and still acting!

Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,Showing Up seems to be a masterpiece just by the looks of it. A24 never disappoints in terms of the quality they tend to showcase in their films.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-06-12,This looks delightful.  I&#39;m SO READY to watch something w/o a cape in it.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-17,This film would of been huge in the 2010‚Äôs. Glad indie films are still around.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,"A24 is killing it this year.. Smile, m3gan, and now this.."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-02-15,"A24 has scarred me and warmed my heart at the same time... anytime I see a trailer, I&#39;m expecting it to get squirrely, but then I&#39;m relived when it gets heartwarming."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,the &quot;have a great night&quot; after expelling your frustration is relatable
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-03-02,"Kelly Reichardt is one of the GREATEST directors currently working!!! It‚Äôs great to see Michelle Williams collaborating  with her again. Also, if you want to make a good movie great, just cast Hong Chau, she is absolutely AMAZING!!!"

Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-02-25,"It&#39;s so odd to be entranced in a movie because of a trailer. It&#39;s not even the main character, it&#39;s every other character that was introduced that I&#39;ve become interested in within just a few seconds of screen time. Very excited for this."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-06-12,"This movie is so creative. It‚Äôs so artsy! Makes me wanna be a painter, artist , sculpture‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.even a pigeon bird rescuer ! üê¶ FYI, did you know that pigeons bird are fully-grown to adulthood by ‚Äú4 weeks‚Äù!!. That‚Äôs why we never see them as babies size."
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-18,Andre finally back on the screen<br>A24 is bussin
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2022-12-15,I swear to God the release of a new A24 trailer is like a mini Christmas for me.
Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2023-03-20,I feel I may watch this film more than once or just one time because I‚Äôll get that ultimate Garden State image that I tried to forget and it‚Äôs definitely a vibe for Creative People. Music may change my mind about it.

Showing Up,wELPTxJ2YZY,2025-03-11,It&#39;s so interesting to me that most of these charaters aren&#39;t looking at eachother while speaking - it&#39;s either mere glances or no eye-contact at all.

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,"Ah, yes, another installment in the Willem DeFoe slowly going insane cinematic universe! My favorite cinematic universe"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-23,"Willem Dafoe chooses to be in the most unique and interesting movies, and he ALWAYS delivers. Incredible actor, definitely giving this a watch"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,Not many actors can maintain your attention by themselves for an entire film. Defoe is one of those rare actors.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,Willem Dafoe certainly knows how to portray every single one of his onscreen characters with gripping and escalating tension. Seems like there&#39;s no end to his acting. He just nails it without much difficulty on his part.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,Who else is ready to watch Willem Dafoe go insane from isolation again?
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-25,"This is just the prequel to Playback Time by Carson Clay, which was directed, produced, written, and acted by Carson Clay. A Masterpiece."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,This movie looks brilliant and they got the perfect lead actor making it a must see
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-30,"If dafoe just mumbles ‚Äúapathy‚Äôs a tragedy and boredom is a crime‚Äù over and over again, then it‚Äôs a masterpiece in my eyes"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,I didn‚Äôt expect the sequel to Bo Burnhams film to star Willem Dafoe.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-18,Calling it now: the owner of the penthouse knew about the heist beforehand and planned for Defoe to be trapped in there and is livestreaming his descent into madness as it&#39;s own art exhibit
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,The premise looks interesting and Willem Defoe is a legend.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-23,I really hope he has the best support from the people around him during these roles. I can just imagine the mental scaring from the process of acting this way especially coming from The Lighthouse. We love you Dafoe.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,Another movie with Willem Defoe going insane? Perfect!
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-12-20,I pray this man wins an Oscar before he&#39;s too old. Hollywood needs to give him his roses while he&#39;s still here. He was robbed for an Oscar with At Eternity&#39;s Gate.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-21,Willem Dafoe being insane is my favorite movie genre. Seriously the range this man has is out of this world. It blows my mind they never tried getting him to play Joker.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-24,I&#39;ve been wanting the Willem Dafoe movie from the Wecond Mr.Bean film for soooo long. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s finally coming.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,"I appreciate the direct allusion to Defoe&#39;s character in Finding Nemo, another character trapped in a glass box that enlists the help of a friendly bird"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-23,"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd have told me a year ago that I‚Äôd be locked inside of my home‚Äù- Willem Dafoe, 2022"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,FFS how come he hasn&#39;t won an Oscar yet??? This is beyond belief. Dafoe is one of the worlds best and yet so underrated. Give him that bloody Oscar!!
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,"Person in pandemic : i learned new language, fixed my car, meditated and reinvented myself. <br><br>What they have actually done:"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,I‚Äôm gonna try to predict the final twist: the fact that this guy is trapped inside is some kind of performance art show. It‚Äôs basically Panic Room meets The Game.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-02-24,"When the guy on the phone said ‚Äúsorry, you‚Äôre on your own‚Äù, I was hoping Defoe would‚Äôve screamed ‚ÄòYOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?!‚Äô at him."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-21,"This man is a treasure, he can act with his shadow &amp; still blow your mind."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-12-14,"I loved how Dafoe interpreted the psychology of being stucked to create claustrophobic atmosphere. This seems to be a great one since Dafoe is putting an amazing acting, I hope the story would have a satisfactory ending."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,How does this man not have an Oscar yet?
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,Best actor alive.  He&#39;s awesome.  I look forward to this.  Dafoe is the highlight of every movie he&#39;s in.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,Never seen Defoe in a bad movie.  Totally stoked for this!!
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,You had me at Willem Dafoe.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-05,"I never get tired of watching Willem going more and more insane, this is what he does with majestry!"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,My god I love Willem Dafoe
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,this looks absolutely incredible and terrifying. I love that they&#39;ve managed to create a sense of isolation in such a large apartment
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,"When Goblin said <b>&quot;Norman&#39;s on sabbatical, honey&quot;</b>  this is where Norman be at üíÄ"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-24,"Trailer started out looking like a pretty standard heist thriller, then just got steadily weirder and darker until it dipped into full-on surreal, visually stunning mindfuck. I really can&#39;t wait to see this one."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,Willem Dafoe is a really underrated actor. For me one of the best of all time no doubt about it.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-13,A whole movie with Dafoe. Can&#39;t wait! I love it already. A good actor can make you watch a whole movie and not feel that anything else is needed.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,I love isolation movies and this looks like it‚Äôll be an interesting one. William Defoe just makes it that much more encouraging to watch.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-11,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=119"">1:59</a>  hits so hard I felt that <br>Bro says:<br><br>‚ÄúCats die, music fades, but art‚Ä¶is for keeps.‚Äù <br><br>Really shows the value of art itself and why it brings certain ppl to I steal them cause it can last forever if preserved properly I love <br>Willem dafoe‚Äôs work sm can‚Äôt wait to see this movie üî•‚ùóÔ∏è"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,"First a lighthouse, now a penthouse. Willem can‚Äôt catch a break."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-24,A 1 to 1 direct Hollywood remake of the Bo Burnham special is exactly what the world needed right now
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-24,Willem DaFoe makes it an instant must watch. Can&#39;t wait for its release
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-24,The thumbnail reminds me of PLAYBACK TIME HAHAHAHAHA
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,At some point in this movie we will be seeing the Green Goblin personality take full hold
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-25,One of the top 3 best actors of all time. On or off stage.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2024-01-04,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=79"">1:19</a> Willem Defore is talking to Dory<br><br>Fun fact: Willem Defoe was also in Finding Nemo. He played Gill, a moorish fish, the leader of the fishes in the dentist‚Äôs aquarium."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-05-06,"Best survival movie I&#39;ve seen in years. Willem Dafoe, as always, is a master at his craft."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-25,For the first 20 seconds I legit thought this was just a clip from that Mr bean movie
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-20,He&#39;s probably trapped in there for like 3 hours or something but goes all Willem Defoe very quickly. Gobbles up the fish after 10 mins.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-26,only Wilem DeFoe could go insane in a million dollar condo with all the amenities.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,"When Dafoe is in it, then you know it&#39;s going to be a good movie."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-09,"Love Dafoe, Incredible performance in every film he&#39;s in."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,Finally a movie I would be interested in seeing.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-23,"Thought for a second that Robert would make a sudden appearance, &quot;Thomas, you dog!&quot;"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-19,"I love how this trailer is put together so I thought I&#39;d try to take a crack at what this might possibly about:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=8"">0:08</a> Here we get the setting which is this particular building in the center of the screen.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> The radio audio is to either be the outside police trying to get into the locked building to capture the intruder OR it&#39;s the earpiece audio the intruder (the main character) is receiving for instructions for this art theft heist probably additionally symbolizing communication between the outside world.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=42"">0:42</a> All the resources start to cease working which may also symbolize the feeling of desperation, panic, and crisis someone/something would feel when they&#39;re in isolation and/or danger.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=67"">1:07</a> Him destroying the priceless art pieces depict the drastic change in priority, needs over wants, when in a life or death situation<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=73"">1:13</a> Him throwing an object at the window only for it to turn into a bird foreshadows the extreme measures one would go through just to escape a trapped in situation only to constantly keep proving the possibility of failure is unavoidable.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=81"">1:21</a> The fish sorta represents as himself in a way because fish are living in their same tank their whole lives just like how he&#39;s locked in for who knows how long but unlike him the fish gets &quot;saved&quot; and &quot;put out of misery&quot; because he kills it from it&#39;s &quot;suffering&quot; as he also benefits by having raw food which temporarily &quot;saves&quot; him until he gets worse and quite possibly dies.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=86"">1:26</a> Here he talks to the pigeon saying &quot;nobody here but us pigeons&quot; which is another way of saying &quot;nobody&#39;s here but us&quot; because to him he relates to the pigeons because he believes they and him are the same for both being &quot;unimportant&quot; to everybody else.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=92"">1:32</a> He &quot;sets free&quot; the taped guy in the picture as if it was himself.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> He draws a pigeon opening it&#39;s third eye as if him and the pigeons have a spiritual bond by mind.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=108"">1:48</a> He then spits water specifically at the third eye to show how they&#39;re both crying on the inside.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> This is definitely a nod to Willem Dafoe&#39;s iconic Green Goblin character as they coincidentally both have a thing for going insane :)<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=125"">2:05</a> and finally this last line where he says &quot;..art is for keeps&quot; is what really interests me as this could possibly be foreshadowing that the owner who owns all those art pieces is purposely keeping the guy trapped for longer than needed so he can get the guy crazy enough to start making &quot;art&quot; because insane or mentally ill people tend to create the most unique abstract art. (Like that pigeon drawing he made on the wall)<br>That&#39;s just my thoughts tho even though I&#39;ve never been to film making classes I for some reason still have an symbolic sense of understanding"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-12-01,"Norman&#39;s on sabbatical, honey.<br>Norman&#39;s sabbatical:"

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-04-08,"I just watched it and is one of the best directorial debuts I&#39;ve seen in a while. Part film, part art exhibition, with the expected top notch performance from DaFoe. Beautiful photography, the entire movie happens in the same environment yet never feels slow or tiresome."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,"After seeing him play in The Lighthouse, i know he is gonna do sooooooo goooood"

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2024-07-02,&quot;Inside&quot; Official Trailer This looks pretty good. I am a huge Willem Dafoe fan. I&#39;ve got to watch this tonight before It leaves Amazon Prime. It looks very suspenseful &amp; lots of twists &amp; turns. Can&#39;t wait...SSSSS..

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-22,saw it yesterday very artistic. Sharp camera angles etc. but I wish it was a better ending
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-07-18,This is exactly what happens you let an &quot;artist&quot; make a movie.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-12-11,Green Goblin gets trapped in a room and turns into Van Gogh. I get it now.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-18,"if you rob a hi-tech penthouse, you might get locked in.  THAAAAAT is how the world works!"
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-27,Willem Defoe has been an old man my whole entire life...
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-04-02,"He is the art. Him being trapped is the art, for rich people to watch him."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-08-13,Loved it!! Surprised to see soo many negative comments. Yes there were a few plot holes but you have to just let it slide for these types of film lol. Basically Castaway...but in a penthouse
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-17,This is the kind of premise that dafoe was made for
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-04-06,Another great movie by Carson Clay!
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-29,"This is good ole fashioned movie making. A Willem Dafoe in all his raw, curious and child-like nature. The Cinematography is certainly and most intentionally quite an artistic spectacle, the stuff of cinema mastery. Highly recommend this movie."
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-18,I actually want to see this movie. I love the trailer.
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-01-10,"If you want to avoid spoilers, pause the trailer at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=50"">0:50</a>"

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,This with him is a must watch!
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-21,Just finished watching it. Just felt a bit unsettling how he drifts into madness
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-22,Loved Williams performance in 12 minutes
Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2022-11-17,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjODCllZj4w&amp;t=35"">0:35</a> Is this supposed to be a reference to Willem‚Äôs other character Gill from Finding Nemo?"

Inside,DjODCllZj4w,2023-03-08,"Willem Dafoe, in what initially appears to  be him playing a thief breaking info a skyscraper building and then being trapped inside. From there, he looks  like he slowly begins to lose his mind. As powerful as an actor as Defoe is<br>I&#39;ve  never been able to understand his obsession with these over the top half crazed <br>characters. It would be refreshing to see Dafoe play the hero and win the day without going through some type of psychosis."
